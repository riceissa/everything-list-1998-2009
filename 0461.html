<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Gilles:]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...In all your thought experiment you seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assume that it is possible to reproduce *exactly* the behaviour of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical system (the brain) with some detailed computation.
</em><br />
<br />[Bruno]
<br />
This is indeed my working hypothesis. To be precise I suppose there is a 
<br />
level of description of myself such that I survive through a digital 
<br />
substitution made at that level. I don't care if the level corresponds to 
<br />
the quantum state of the entire cosmos or just the local concentration of 
<br />
neurone's neurotransmettor ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;impossible : the physical reality is not computable exactly, at least in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our present knowledge...
</em><br />
<br />I am not sure about that...
<br />
All solutions of Schroedinger equation are provably turing computable. 
<br />
Classical mechanics (in all reasonnable representations) is turing 
<br />
computable. deterministic chaos is turing computable...
<br />
Quantum computer are turing computable, even if that entails an 
<br />
exponential slow down.
<br />
Actually it is rather hard to build a differential or fonctionnal 
<br />
equation such that it admit non turing computable solution. It is even 
<br />
not totaly unambiguous how to do that thanks to the different possible 
<br />
choice of Real's representations. Pour-el and Richard did it, I mean they 
<br />
build ad hoc differential equation and use an extension of turing 
<br />
computability on the reals (which is not the one proposed by Turing) 
<br />
which has non turing computable solutions. This has hardly convince 
<br />
physicists of the existence of some non computable behaviour in nature.
<br />
<br />This is so true that Penrose asks us a rather big leap of imagination to 
<br />
get some uncomputable aspect in the universe.
<br />
<br />I suspect you are using the computability notion in the sense of 
<br />
&quot;practically computable&quot; function. I use it in the TURING sense ! It is 
<br />
not a question of prediction, but just of emulation. You cannot predict 
<br />
the weather for tomorow, but allowing arbitrary computationnal steps and 
<br />
tapes, wheater is turing emulable. Remember that Schmidhuber's great 
<br />
programmer is infinitely patient, which is enough for my purpose.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A very profound reason for that is that we do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;know how to describe it, independantly of the physical laws that govern it.
</em><br />
<br />OK. That is why &quot;operationnaly&quot; computationnalism consist in a BET on a 
<br />
substitution level.
<br />
<br />But these remark are not relevant. I am not asking you if you belief in 
<br />
comp, I am just asking you if you understand what I mean by comp, and to 
<br />
accept it for the sake of the discussion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's why you still have room to make any hypothesis on the nature of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality! But that forbids to consider systems strictly &quot;equivalent&quot; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other ones. You can build machines that will &quot;mimic&quot; other machines up to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some level and during some time, but their fate will necessarily diverge at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some point.
</em><br />
<br />Indeed, but this is true even for an appendicite operation.
<br />
I mean that, BY DEFINITION, if COMP is correct, and if the level of 
<br />
substitution is correct then I will come back from the hospital with the 
<br />
same feeling of someone coming back after a succesfull operation.
<br />
Of course it is an event in my life, and my life will diverge from the 
<br />
possible life I would have had having not go to the hospital.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I didn't find [PE-omega] in your thesis, may be because it is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;English acronym for the experiment that you describe in French? I suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you are speaking of the replacement of a brain by a digital one, with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible infinite duplication of one person.
</em><br />
<br />You can find the PE-omega experiment in the archive of this 
<br />
discussion-list, for example in James Higgo's quotation, precisely at
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/msg00473.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/msg00473.html</a>
<br />
<br />In my thesis <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/marchal</a> it is the &quot;argument du 
<br />
deployuer universel&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The problem that I see with this experiment is that it poses the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the definition of identity, which is a sand-heap like problem. It is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*physical* problem but a *semantic* one. We, high mammifers that have had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;struggle with the physical universe, have developed the notion of identity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a case where it was rather well defined, because there is no natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mechanism that duplicates large organisms. (however such a mechanism does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist for simple cells, as you remark yourselves at the beginning of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thesis). However, this notion, like all human notions, could become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unappropriate in different conditions. If we were really able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;duplicate&quot; the brain (which has to be proven), 
</em><br />
<br />That will never be proved (unless we are inconsistant). Actually it is 
<br />
not difficult to proof that IF there is a level such that I survive the 
<br />
substitution at that level, then I will never been able to prove that I 
<br />
will survive the substitution at that level. 
<br />
About &quot;identity&quot;, it is not necessary to define it at the start of the 
<br />
reasoning. Of course, the conclusion of the reasoning will shed some 
<br />
light on new ways to understand the notion. At the first step an attempt 
<br />
toward a &quot;correct definition&quot; is premature.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...we should more carefully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;redefine this notion. We can argue that two realizations based on the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;initial brain should be consider as the same entity, or the contrary. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;again it is a semantic problem, and for me it cannot give you any clue on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the nature of the world
</em><br />
<br />I suspect this is because you are physicalist at the start. The question 
<br />
&quot;do I  survive substitution ...&quot; is not a semantical one. It is a natural 
<br />
question anyone can ask his physician before any (serious) medical 
<br />
operation. Only if you follow the reasonning (or if you find it by 
<br />
yourself) will you see how comp provides precise and fundamental clues on 
<br />
the nature of the world. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (just like asking whether viruses are living
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;organisms or not doesn't help to know their replication mechanism). Indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in our real world, true twins are born from the same cell : in this case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they *are* actually considered as different persons.
</em><br />
<br />Sure !
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I think that in the case  where duplication would be possible, we would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;naturally modify our notion of identity. We may for example think us as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;array&quot; I[1], I[2]...instead of a single person. The I[i] would share the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same history at the beginning,,but differ after some time.  All the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;questions and paradoxes  related to the question &quot;who is &quot;I&quot;?&quot; would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disappear simply because we would be led to adapt our notions to a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reality, and this question would loose any sense, because &quot;I&quot; would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lost its property of unicity. 
</em><br />
<br />I am not saying there is a paradox, we are just at a begining of a 
<br />
reasoning
<br />
The important point is that each person remains a person from the first 
<br />
person point of view. This is basic folk psychology without which term 
<br />
like &quot;consciousness&quot;, &quot;survive&quot;, etc; has no meaning.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(A comparable evolution has already been made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in QM for example, where the question &quot;where is the electron?&quot; has lost its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense). That's why I call that a &quot;semantic&quot; problem, and not a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Indeed, but for those who think twice on Everett, we loose our identity a 
<br />
long &quot;time&quot; ago. What is true for the electron is true for the physicist.
<br />
And this can be deduced from comp. QM is a rather unexpected confirmation 
<br />
of comp. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; After this mental revolution , we would face the same problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understanding the origin of thought!
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;... but for this reason, and as a physicist, I wouldn't call it an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;explanation&quot; at all...
</em><br />
<br />OK, But wait. I am not even searching such an explanation. I am just 
<br />
proving that those who believes in comp MUST find such an explanation. I 
<br />
also show in my work some necessary and important qualitative aspect such 
<br />
an explanation must take (for exemple the many worlds phenomenology).
<br />
<br />Note that, according to my proof, you are coherent. I am just showing the 
<br />
incompatibility of comp and (even very weak form of) physicalism. If I am 
<br />
correct, you are both physicalist and non-computationnalist. I tell you I 
<br />
respect that position, and there is no reason my proof should change your 
<br />
mind.
<br />
On the contrary, those who belief in comp AND in physicalism must either 
<br />
change their mind, or tell me at which steps in PE-omega they find an 
<br />
error. 
<br />
<br />If you are not willing to accept (at least momentarily) comp for the sake 
<br />
of that proof, you will never see my point or find an error in it (My 
<br />
point is that IF comp is correct THEN matter is a product of the mind, 
<br />
and physics is ontologicaly reduced to psychology, where psychology is 
<br />
defined by the discourses and silences of self-referentially correct 
<br />
universal machines relatively to their most probable computationnal 
<br />
histories.)
<br />
Comp is interesting because it gives astonishingly powerfull clues for 
<br />
the logical and arithmetical origin of machine's belief in physical laws.
<br />
(The roots of the non-trivialness of these clues are linked to the 
<br />
non-trivialness of Church classical thesis and subsequent incompleteness 
<br />
phenomenon). 
<br />
<br />I strongly recommand Wheeler's paper &quot;Laws without law&quot; for a 
<br />
pre-physical motivations for such an enterprise. 
<br />
But of course, if you take the universe for granted, like most 
<br />
physicalist, then &quot;my proof&quot; is just not relevant. Physics and the 
<br />
Foundation of Physics are quite distinct matter.
<br />
<br />So now, if you are still interested in the proof, keep in mind the 
<br />
hypothetical nature of (turing) computationnalism.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Bruno.
