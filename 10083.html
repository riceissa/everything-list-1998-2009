Le 29-juil.-06, à 18:23, David Nyman a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;No doctor!&quot;  Or rather, it depends what you mean by 'what really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; describes me'.  What I have argued is that, at the 'physical' level of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; description, running a hardware-independent computation could never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'really describe me' in one of the main senses of 'describe' - to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demarcate or individualise.  This, IMO, is because there are necessary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isomorphisms to brain function that could not be preserved in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardware-independent implementation (because of the lack of constraint
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on what the hardware is doing).
</em><br />
<br /><br />At this stage you should try to be specific about the reasons why an 
<br />
hardware independent isomorphism cannot exist, or perhaps you are just 
<br />
saying that &quot;first person feeling&quot; would not be genuine if they were 
<br />
not related to some 'physical reality' in which case I could agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, I would be content that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the necessary isomorphisms to brain function at the 'physical' level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were fully emulated within comp, - i.e. the 'hardware' is itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emulated - then 'what really describes me' could be preserved.  Of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course, within comp, all these levels are superposed.
</em><br />
<br />In this list/context &quot;superposed&quot; is perhaps saying too much but those 
<br />
&quot;level&quot; (which here are better described by person's notion or point of 
<br />
views) are precisely related.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interestingly, to return to the 'doctor' test, our willingness or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; otherwise to undergo this has interesting connections to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unnameability of the first person.  Even when we believe in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'continuity' of our personhood under these conditions, our interest in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preserving this continuity can only be sentimental, or possibly moral,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather than 'concrete'.  Since all 'I's are equally unnameable, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be absolutely agnostic as to which 'I' we are.  As comp is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'processing' all of us, comp *is* a superposition of all of us.
</em><br />
<br /><br />If you agree, with Lee Corbin, that after a self-duplication(*) you are 
<br />
both of the reconstitution despite they will have divergent 
<br />
experiences, then you can be open that there is only one first person, 
<br />
just experimenting different histories. But strictly speaking this 
<br />
should remain comp-undecidable and could be a matter of personal 
<br />
taste/attachment, etc. Here comp can lead to a variety of beliefs and 
<br />
practices. The key is a bit paradoxal: as long as you don't impose your 
<br />
version of &quot;personal identity&quot; to others I think you remain coherent 
<br />
with the necessary comp modesty in those matters. But there is a sense 
<br />
in which comp superposes us all, like the quantum without collapse.
<br />
<br />(*) comp makes it possible that you are &quot;read and cut&quot; in Brussels, and 
<br />
&quot;pasted&quot; in both Beijing and Kigali, say. Such self-fuplication are 
<br />
well-suited to illustrate the difference between 1 and 3 person point 
<br />
of view. This leads to a notion of 1-person indeterminacy, and 
<br />
'hardware' should emerge (and emerges, albeit slowly) from a possible 
<br />
measure of relative self-indeterminacy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will read with interest (although it may well be beyond my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical grasp).  However, how do you feel about my suggestion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; above that comp (being the superposition of all persons - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'context' in which personhood arises) - is by this token essentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'personal'?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure. Feel free to dig in that direction, but it seems to me 
<br />
it is easier to accept some sharable part of 3-mathematics and build 
<br />
from that. Especially when we have an unavoidable self-reference for a 
<br />
vast class of machines. Thanks to Turing &amp; Co. we can see, like Godel 
<br />
already saw in 1933, that godelian self-reference cannot describe a 
<br />
knower, but then, using some math trick we can define a knower in term 
<br />
of self-reference+ truth which provides a good candidate for a notion 
<br />
of first person (even unameable by the machine). Somehow a &quot;physical 
<br />
reality&quot; is what Number-Nature needs for entangling closely enough the 
<br />
many possible independent computations, so as to made first person 
<br />
stable and partially sharable. *many*-worlds prevent such approaches 
<br />
against solipsism.
<br />
Perhaps I agree that the context in which particular personhood arises 
<br />
is first person (plural), but the context in which personhood per se 
<br />
arise is eventually &quot;reducible&quot; to the behavior of the roots of a 
<br />
universal diophantine polynomial (or choose your favorite turing 
<br />
universal systems).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I'm prepared to believe in the 3-reality of numbers plus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independent personal reality of the number domain.  IMO, only in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; presence of such personal reality could individual personhood be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structured and demarcated though numbers.
</em><br />
<br />OK.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I have suggested above, I would rather postulate that the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; domain is personal, than that some (theological?) first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructed them.  Numbers are then 'primitive' in that we do not need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything else to account for the appearances we observe.  Within this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IMO, personal point-of-view would be a function of structural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships and demarcation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />All right.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We may be getting 'terminological' again.  IMO, if 'many persons and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their many worlds' can arise, then the context in which this occurs is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'personal'.  'Numbers together with their additive and multiplicative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure' sounds like a nice abstraction, but for it to do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary work, this concept must refer to a context in which personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality exists.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Mmh... Danger of getting in circle here. Given that I work and write 
<br />
with 3-propositions, I cannot follow you here. To be simple the comp 
<br />
ontology would be Numbers, then a Universal Diophantine Equation (or 
<br />
any turing universal system), then many computations some involving 
<br />
self-referentially correct machine (relatively to their most probable 
<br />
computations &quot;bearing&quot; them). Those will develop by incompleteness a 
<br />
first person (always basically frustrated solipsistic person wanting to 
<br />
control everything: some times I call it the barbarian), and luckily 
<br />
enough in hopefully non solipsistic context the third person point of 
<br />
view (the one able to conceive and listen to some other possible first 
<br />
person view albeit in that indirect ways relying on third person/first 
<br />
person plural phones).
<br />
That eventually there is a duality making it possible to choose the 
<br />
first person point of view as the most basic one cannot yet be entirely 
<br />
ruled out for sure, but comp and the quantum without collapse makes it 
<br />
as unlikely imo.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, I mean (as I have mentioned above), that if comp emulated the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'hardware', then the isomorphisms could be preserved at the (emulated)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'physical level.  Hence this does not violate the primitivity of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers.
</em><br />
<br />OK, but do you see this moves invite you to provide a definition of 
<br />
&quot;first person&quot; in third person term. Comp succeeds partially, but then 
<br />
justified completely why its success cannot be but partial. Indeed 
<br />
eventually the physical appearances emerges from the never completely 
<br />
specifiable border of the person.
<br />
The platonic number does not emerge, and I agree they are mysterious, 
<br />
but here too we can understand that we cannot infer our beliefs in them 
<br />
from any weaker beliefs.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Careful with wishful thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am, I hope, always careful, especially with wishful thinking (is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this an example of recursion?)
</em><br />
<br /><br />If this is wishful thinking, then this an example of recursion. But 
<br />
then that's not wishful thinking, so it is not an example of recursion. 
<br />
But then it is wishful thinking ...
<br />
... and then it is certainly an example of meta-recursion ... (I will 
<br />
stop here ;)
