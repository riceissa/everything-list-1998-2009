<br />
The Wiki article &quot;Quantum suicide and immortality&quot; (http://
<br />
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality) states:
<br />
<br />&quot;Also, the philosopher David Lewis, in &quot;How Many Lives Has
<br />
Schrödinger's Cat?&quot;, remarked that in the vast majority of the worlds
<br />
in which an immortal observer might find himself (i.e. the subset of
<br />
quantum-possible worlds in which the observer does not die), he will
<br />
survive, but will be terribly maimed. This is because in each of the
<br />
scenarios typically given in thought experiments (nuclear bombing,
<br />
Russian roulette, etc.), for every world in which the observer
<br />
survives unscathed, there are likely to be far more worlds in which
<br />
the observer survives terribly disfigured, badly disabled, and so on.
<br />
It is for this reason, Lewis concludes, that we ought to hope that the
<br />
many-worlds interpretation is false.&quot;
<br />
<br />David Lewis' statement cuts to the core of the nature of
<br />
consciousness. If each conscious observer on planet Earth (and let's
<br />
assume the laws of physics don't limit consciousness to humans but
<br />
includes any sentient animal life form) exists in &quot;Many Worlds&quot; (see
<br />
Wiki topic on physicist &quot;Hugh Everett III&quot; at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Everett">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Everett</a>)
<br />
then Houston, we've got a problem.
<br />
<br />The human population alone is over 06 billion conscious observers. Each
<br />
observer can cause branching into an unfathomably huge number of
<br />
parallel universes (or perhaps an infinite number). Everyone else, in
<br />
addition to an incomprehensibly large number of people only born in
<br />
some parallel universes, branches into their own parallel universes,
<br />
extrapolating logically from the &quot;Many Worlds&quot; theory. Each one of us
<br />
is essentially forced to consciously exist in parallel universes that
<br />
continue coming into existence as the result of the actions of every
<br />
other conscious observer on this planet. Include conscious non-human
<br />
observers (animal and who knows what else) and Houston, we've got a
<br />
really big problem... or is it really a problem?
<br />
<br />Instead of using this line of thinking to debunk the &quot;Many Worlds&quot;
<br />
interpretation, I think this isn't such a big problem as it initially
<br />
appears.
<br />
<br />For one thing, consider sleep walking.
<br />
<br />Sleep walkers can appear conscious, carry on conversations, drive
<br />
automobiles and operate machinery, essentially do things they can do
<br />
in the awake state. Only when they're sleep walking, they do not
<br />
remember those minutes or hours they did all these things. In essence
<br />
they &quot;fast forwarded&quot; through those events, even though other
<br />
observers may have carried on coversations with them, witnessed them
<br />
driving an automobile or doing other things, all the time thinking
<br />
these sleepwalkers were wide awake and conscious.
<br />
<br />Suppose our existences in parallel universes is similar to if we were
<br />
sleepwalking? Suppose we are not conscious observers in those parallel
<br />
universes, but other conscious observers believe we are conscious as
<br />
well? Suppose others in this parallel universe we are in, are
<br />
similarly sleepwalking in that they are not conscious in this parallel
<br />
universe (but are conscious in another)? That leads to interesting
<br />
possibilities and questions. Do we somehow &quot;choose&quot; the parallel
<br />
universe where we are consciously present and awake? Do people close
<br />
to us likely &quot;choose&quot; to be present and conscious in the same parallel
<br />
universe we are present and conscious in, so in our relationship with
<br />
them, we're not talking to someone who is sleepwalking and really not
<br />
conscious? When we are in a parallel universe where we are not
<br />
consciously present, does this mean the human brain operates the body
<br />
like a biological machine, similarly to unconscious human-like
<br />
androids in the movie &quot;I, Robot&quot; that one could swear are real
<br />
sentient people?
<br />
<br />The questions snowball along this line of thinking, as one wonders if
<br />
our consciousness moves from one parallel universe to another? If we
<br />
don't like our lives or the way the world has become, could our
<br />
consciousness latch on to another more favorable timeline while the
<br />
sleepwalking unconscious version of ourselves continues in the
<br />
parallel universe we consciously departed from? What mechanism causes
<br />
this change? Is it intensely wishing for a different outcome in our
<br />
lives, or a different world where the recession ended?
<br />
<br />If each observer on this planet is capable of spawning branching
<br />
parallel universes, are there unconscious sleepwalking versions of us
<br />
in an infinite number of timelines? This leads to a very scary
<br />
question, could our consciousness &quot;wake up&quot; in some bazaar timeline
<br />
caused by other conscious observers, a place where we do not want to
<br />
exist? When we open our eyes in the darkness of our bedrooms, look at
<br />
the clock radio and breathe a sigh of relief that we were only
<br />
dreaming, is it possible what we just experienced wasn't a dream but a
<br />
conscious observance looking at another parallel universe from the
<br />
perspective of Schrödinger's Cat?
