<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am not sure I follow you here. All what Godel's incompleteness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; proves is that no machine, or no axiomatisable theory can solve all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; halting problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The undecidability is always relative to such or such theory or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; machine prover. For self-modifying theorem prover, the undecidable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sentence can evolve.  (extensionaly, and yet remain the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; intensionally)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with everything you say there, so I'm not sure where you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aren't following me. I definitely agree with the idea of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-modifying theorem prover that becomes stronger over time-- I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think it is the right model. What I am saying in the paragraph you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quoted is that one &quot;way out&quot; is to claim that when we add axioms to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strengthen our system, we can choose either the axiom or the negation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrarily, since either is consistent with the system so far. I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argued with people who explicitly claim this. My opinion is that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is only one correct choice for each addition.
</em><br />
<br />I agree, for a category of pure machine, not yet confronted to some  
<br />
&quot;bigger or older&quot; universal machine.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the case of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; halting problem, we want to reflect the actual truth about halting; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the (equivalent) domain of undecidable numerical statements, we still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want the actual truth.
</em><br />
<br />Well some of them, like you, equivalent or bigger machine, will never  
<br />
know, unless you are infinitely patient.
<br />
Insolubility here is hard, but it makes the mathematical world  
<br />
necessarily ever surprising.
<br />
You can hope for a theory of everything, which preserves the mystery,  
<br />
which makes it even more mysterious.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, I should mention that the arithmetical hierarchy shows that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems are &quot;more undecidable&quot; than halting: if we had a halting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oracle, we would still be unable to decide those problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber's super-omegas are a perfect example.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is why the computationalist hypothesis is non trivial. It gives a  
<br />
prominent role to Sigma_1 completeness. The oracle can still play an  
<br />
important role &quot;from inside&quot;, but even this is not sure. (and then  
<br />
comp gives importance to sigma_1 completeness relatively to an oracle).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/kolmogorov.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/kolmogorov.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you probably knew that already.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; For such machine the self-stopping problem become &quot;absolutely-yet-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; relatively-to-them&quot; undecidable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Actually I am very happy with this, because , assuming comp, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; could explain why humans fight on this question since so long. And we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can bet it is not finished!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This argument is given in longer form elsewhere? Perhaps that paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you mention later on?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have not publish this. I explain it informally in my french thesis  
<br />
long version. But it is obvious I think, especially assuming comp. It  
<br />
is implicit in my Plotinus paper (still on my first page of my url I  
<br />
think).
<br />
Finite machine are limited. But finite machine which believes in the  
<br />
induction axioms can know that they are limited, and can build  
<br />
theories explaining those limitation. Formally this gives autonomous  
<br />
progression. The correct one have to converge to some &quot;non convergence  
<br />
possible&quot; in the horizon ...
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Tarski 's theorem is even more &quot;religious&quot;, in the computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; setting. It means that the concept of truth (about a machine) acts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; already like a &quot;god&quot; for that machine. No (sound) machine can givee a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; name to its own proof predicate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To extend the model of the self-modifying theorem prover... the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scenario I use when thinking about truth is a population of entities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which, among other things, need to reason properly about each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I could perhaps reduce this to one entity that, among other things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needs to reason about itself; but that is needlessly recursive.) The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic that these entities use evolves over time.
</em><br />
<br />Relatively to some universal machine. I see subtle difficulties I  
<br />
don't want to bore you with.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In any given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generation, the entity who can represent the truth-predicate of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most other entities will dominate.
</em><br />
<br />Why?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question, then, is: what logic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will the population eventually converge to?
</em><br />
<br /><br />If the entities believes in classical logic, and if they believe in  
<br />
induction, they will converge toward the self-reference logic of  
<br />
Solovay (G and G*, or GL and GLS nowadays).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think fair arguments could be given for the fixed-point or revision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories in this scenario, but like I said, both create reference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gaps... so some creature could dominate over these by inventing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicate to fill the gap. That creature will then have its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reference gaps, and yet more gap-filling predicates will be created.
</em><br />
<br />I think so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My current thinking is that each gap-filling predicate will correspond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to an ordinal number, so that the maximal logic will be one with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gap-filling predicate for each ordinal number. No gap will be left,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because if there was such a gap, it would correspond to an ordinal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number larger than all ordinal numbers, which is impossible. Of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course, this gives rise to an outlandish number of truth-values (one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for each ordinal number), when normally any more than 2 is considered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questionable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not really, because those truth value are, imo, not really truth  
<br />
value, but they quantify a ladder toward infinite credibility,  
<br />
assurance or something. Perhaps security.
<br />
Still, you can do this constructively, and provably so, only up to a  
<br />
constructive ordinal. In that case, your entire population will  
<br />
develop a &quot;last&quot; large reference gap. Or ... your population will  
<br />
&quot;live&quot; forever with &quot;little gaps&quot;, and will converge toward the first  
<br />
non constructive ordinal, but nobody, well no machines, will ever know  
<br />
that.
<br />
<br />Yet, from their first person point of view, it is different.  From  
<br />
their first person point of view they fill all gaps immediately.  
<br />
Perfectly sound machines will identify truth and proof, consistently  
<br />
so, and fill the gap. Only seen from outside, for not too much complex  
<br />
machine, *we* can see they are &quot;wrong&quot; ... from outside, and correct  
<br />
from inside.
<br />
This entails that &quot;conscious machine&quot; will have hard time to believe  
<br />
that they are machine.
<br />
It is a bit like Skolem paradox. it depends how we will interpret the  
<br />
ordinal. this can lead to very difficult questions, and the  
<br />
hierarchies you mentionned can be useful. To be sure this could be too  
<br />
technical for the list, where we discuss very basic fundamental  
<br />
question, and no so many people knows the technic in logic.
<br />
<br />Actually, we are discussing an argument that IF we are machine  
<br />
(whatever we are, except the physical universe), then the physical  
<br />
universe is not entirely computable. The physical universe cannot be  
<br />
the output of a program, nor really directly generated by a program.  
<br />
It has to emerge statistically from all possible computation going  
<br />
through possible observers. It is generated, but only implicitly, by  
<br />
the running of a universal dovetailer. A program whose existence  
<br />
relies on Church thesis, which generates and executes all programs by  
<br />
zigazaguing on all their executions. It has to zigzag because we are  
<br />
not able, and never will be, to predict in advance which programs  
<br />
stops or doesn't stop.
<br />
<br />My general feeling is that incompleteness is the guaranty of  
<br />
seriousness of the mechanist hypothesis in the cognitive science, and  
<br />
even in the physical science. The lesson of Gödel's first  
<br />
incompleteness theorem is a lesson in modesty (provably so assuming  
<br />
comp). The lesson of Gödel's second incompleteness theorem is a lesson  
<br />
of wonder: all self-introspecting universal machine can learn the  
<br />
modesty lesson!
<br />
Incompleteness is also what makes Church thesis consistent (see the  
<br />
first footnote of the Plotinus paper). This has no price, because it  
<br />
makes computability the first absolute mathematical epistemological  
<br />
notion. We don't have this for the notion of provability, nor of  
<br />
knowledge, still less of provability. But we have modal logic which  
<br />
are invariant for their interpretation thanks to Gödel, Löb and  
<br />
Solovay. Do you know the provability logics?
