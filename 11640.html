===============================================
<br />
STEP 7:  Something from nothing. (the big bang)
<br />
<br />U(.) = (*) from previous STEP.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= (()()()()()()()()()().......()()()()())
<br />
<br />There is some need to deal with this issue because it leads to the
<br />
mathematical drive of EC that we inside see as the second law of
<br />
thermodynamics.
<br />
<br />NOTES:
<br />
1) The axiom set is one single huge fluctuation (*) which I have
<br />
previously labelled U and depicted as U(.).
<br />
<br />2) The overall 'fluctuation' is the same (a fluctuation!) but different in
<br />
that it consists of the temporary coherence of a massive collection of
<br />
individual (). The overall process could really be labeled U( as what is
<br />
happening is one massive fluctuation followed by a return to 'nothing'
<br />
where all the () disperse. In terms of physics you could call this a
<br />
single massive 'symmetry breaking' event caused by a single massive
<br />
coherence.
<br />
<br />3) At the initial point (big bang) there is no structure in U(.) other
<br />
than the initial coherence (which can vary throughout but overall still
<br />
add up to one super-fluctuation).
<br />
<br />4) The underlying processes that are the source of each () are, in
<br />
essence, deep randomness. Depth unknown. Call the deeper randomness of
<br />
which a () is constructed a []. There can be a variable number of [] in a
<br />
(). For EC at this stage we don't have to worry about the number of [] in
<br />
(). Although it will determine the initial rules of formation.
<br />
<br />5) The underlying processes [] can be incoherent, but dispersal of [] from
<br />
coherent () will tend to reinforce coherent emergent [] structures back up
<br />
into it. Thus the situation can dynamically persist.
<br />
<br />6) The reason it happens at all is that a perfect 'nothing', everywhere
<br />
and always, requires an infinite amount of energy. Infinities are
<br />
impossible, so the something comes from nothing as an 'average' nothing.
<br />
'Nothing' can therefore be be viewed as intrinsically unstable. Any
<br />
appearance of anything can be regarded as a temporary failure to be
<br />
'Nothing'. This sounds nuts but it's consistent with the facts and
<br />
logical.
<br />
<br />7) The net result is that the dispersal of () partly or fully into [] and
<br />
deeper is the natural drive of U(). () Each () can be thought of as a
<br />
mathematician. The number of mathematicians in EC is equal to the number
<br />
of () that collaborate according to the rules of formation.
<br />
<br />At this point and with further thought....EC predicts what we see as
<br />
energy, entropy, black holes, background radiation, gravity and the
<br />
origins of some of our laws of nature. But that's way too much info and a
<br />
side issue. We are really interested in the entire class of possible EC
<br />
treated as structure made of change based on an arbitrarily large source
<br />
of randomness pumped by the instability of 'Nothing'.
<br />
===================================
<br />
<br /><br />I think I've blown your brains out enough with this lot.
<br />
<br />NEXT
<br />
Before rules of formation we have to look at dynamic hierarchies, lossy
<br />
and lossless entities and 'symmetry breaking'.
