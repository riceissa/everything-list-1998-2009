Hi Stephen;
<br />
<br />I suppose we can think of time as a dimension. However, there are provisos. 
<br />
Time is not like x, y, or z in so far as we have no ability to freely 
<br />
navigate the axis in any direction we choose. We are embedded in time and it 
<br />
moves onwards in a single direction without anyone’s consent. Furthermore, 
<br />
where it possible to move around in time all sorts of paradoxes would appear 
<br />
to ensue that just don’t when I traverse the spatial dimensions. I’d appeal 
<br />
to an asymmetry between time and space, it is a dimension of sorts, but not 
<br />
one that can conceptually swapped with a spatial dimension easily. I don’t 
<br />
think the a priori requirements for space will be necessarily the same as 
<br />
those for time.
<br />
<br />Therefore, whilst our prior notions of space might be fairly complex, it 
<br />
seems to me that our a priori notion of time is in fact very simple. It is 
<br />
just the notion of succession. That time exists if there is a successor 
<br />
event to this event. I can imagine a succession of events that are 
<br />
repetitions of one another, and whilst I can agree that duration would not 
<br />
be measurable, that time might not be noticed, our a priori notion of time 
<br />
is not contradicted despite that.
<br />
<br />'What is a &quot;clock&quot; if not an means to measure change?'
<br />
<br />A clock changes in order to measure time. Change is the measure of time, but 
<br />
is not necessary for time to occur. Changes do not occur just because time 
<br />
passes. Change is just necessary for measurement. I agree that time carries 
<br />
with it the possibility of change, but that is not the same. It cannot be 
<br />
both necessary and just possible, and the notion of change being a 
<br />
possibility entails that there is no contradiction in the notion of time in 
<br />
which there is no change.
<br />
<br />As to how we extract notions of transitivity from series of events, I would 
<br />
imagine it similar to how we extract notions of causation from sets of 
<br />
constant conjunctions.
<br />
<br />'Does a &quot;history&quot;&quot; include values that can be associated with either of 
<br />
McTaggart's A or B series?'
<br />
<br />There is a strong argument to suppose it can be. The B series seems to carry 
<br />
all the information needed to judge truth conditions of reflexive statements 
<br />
such as 'event E is past' (from the A Series). The statement is true so long 
<br />
as it is occurs after event E. A B Series can then at least take a part in 
<br />
our conception of a history.
<br />
<br />What is needed is a sense of 'now'. A change of time rather than a change in 
<br />
time, a succession of events. So temporal becoming has to be invoked somehow 
<br />
- but also, it shouldn’t be identified with conscious experience, there is 
<br />
no requirement for transitivity 'within the frame' so to speak. The danger 
<br />
with associating temporal becoming with our personal experience of time is 
<br />
that it is this that appears to deny time. To conclude that our experience 
<br />
of time is somehow fundamental to time itself, is to deny time exists when 
<br />
there is no observation of it.
<br />
<br />Are you not open to the charge you are levelling at others? Are you not at 
<br />
least partially a time denier?
<br />
<br />I accept that in  a sense we always imagine time from a temporal 
<br />
perspective, that we can not leap out of the temporal view so to speak, but 
<br />
whether that should lead to a conclusion that makes experience of time 
<br />
fundamental is not so clear.
<br />
<br /><br />I prefer to think that temporal becoming is in some way an objective 
<br />
property of time. I think of it as conceived by Aristotle, as the now that 
<br />
stays the same, as 'what is now' changes. We experience time as we do with a 
<br />
future past and present, because of the way time in fact is. Where I think 
<br />
computational models might break down regards what process they invoke to 
<br />
run the B series in order to stamp each event with future, now and past, - 
<br />
what is their incarnation of 'now' - and whether the adoption of such a 
<br />
process involves a pernicious infinite regress.
<br />
<br />regards
<br />
<br />Chris.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Hi Stephen;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I have a couple of quesitions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Emulations involve some notion of a process and such are temporal. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;idea that a process, of any kind, can &quot;occur&quot; requires some measure of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;both transitivity and duration.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The mere *existence* of a process only speaks to its potential for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;occurrence.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Im not quite sure what you mean by this. Possibly you mean that to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;coherently describe time it isnt enough to have laid out in succession a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;series of moments, or events, described by real numbers or however. There 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;must also be something running through the series in order for the concept 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of time to make any sense. If you like, there must be a 'now' - a temporal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;position of sorts - in which raw sensory experience - audio and vision 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;perhaps - comes together synaesthetically into a coherent perspective and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is then consigned to memory. Put another way, there are many strips of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;film one could thread through a projector but until one does so the well 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;ordered sequence of frames remains static, time is not realised in any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;coherent way in a film until it is shown. I think that if this is what you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mean (or close) i'ld like to add my support to you're objection.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    What you seem to be considering is the distiction between 1st and 3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person aspects! The &quot;...laid out in succession a series of moments, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events, described by real numbers or however&quot; is the 3rd person: The &quot;view 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from the outside&quot; of time. The 1st person aspect is: &quot;running through the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;series in order for the concept of time to make any sense&quot;. This is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;view from the inside in the sense that at any given &quot;present moment&quot; - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;'now'- an observer (that has the capasity of making a report) will find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself within an experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    What ever the means are considered to generate that &quot;experience&quot;, what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;does not change here is that the any observer will have a 1st person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience of something and within that experience there will be some means 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of distinguishing the overall content of that experience and some sense of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somehow being seperate from it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    It is this &quot;seperateness&quot; that, I believe, connect the 1st and 3rd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;person aspects and this is where the &quot;inside&quot; and &quot;outside&quot; framing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obtains. One way of thinking of this is to consider a video game that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;set up so that on can switch between seeing the computer generated scene, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as one &quot;moves around&quot;, from the point of view of &quot;where the eyes are&quot; to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the point of view of a camera &quot;floating overhead&quot;. What remained the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the switching?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;However, you might mean that there must be some sense of duration and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;transitivity within each individual moment. If you like, a series of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;events (frames, real numbers) which individually have no duration (or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;sense of transition) can not therefore collectively be considered to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;obtain such properties. I disagree with that. duration and transitivity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;can obtain accross a span of events, and to be strict I dont undestand the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;requirement for change at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    No, if we are taking the notion of a moment to an infinitesimal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;slice&quot;. It seems that in our eagerness to mathematize everything in sight, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we neglect the consequences that obtain. Numbers by themselves do not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;naturally code for the operations on those numbers. We can arbitrarily 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assign some number to &quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, etc. as we find in Goodel numbering, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this is not natural, it must be assigned &quot;by hand&quot;! Thus we find ourselves 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the predicament of having to account for where the notions of duration 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and transitivity come from.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    As to the requirement of change, I am claiming that we must have some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;prior notion of change, at least the potential to change, in order to have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a coherent notion of transitioning from one &quot;frame&quot;, number, Observer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Moment, Time capsule, or whatever. Even is we are going to use numbers, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simplest of the ideas here, we have to have some &quot;change&quot; between the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numbers themselves as some quantity to relations between the numbers. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mere existence of quantities is not sufficient to include both the numbers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;themselves and the relationships between them (the latter including the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;operations on the numbers). Figuratively, somewhere somehow, there must be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;included some form of change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'Time, from what I have studied so far, involves two distinct notions: a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;measure of change&quot; and an &quot;order of succession&quot;.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I can see that time involves an 'order of succession'. I dont see that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;time is a 'measure of change', if by that you mean that time depends on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;change to exist. I can concieve an infinate universe consisting of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;solitary glove over time, a universe in which there are moments but no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;change. Awareness of time might not be possible in the absense of change, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;but that is not the same thing as time not existing. Moreover, it seems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;odd to insist - if you are insisting - that events (frames, real numbers) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;change rather than the just the substances which characterise the event 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    What is a &quot;clock&quot; if not an means to measure change? Time is not the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change itself, it is the valuation of that change. Change is what is taken 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be a priori in the notion of time; in requers some process of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;differentiation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    &quot;Distance&quot; is a measure of extention, requiring some prior co-existence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of differenciable entities. The how and the why of this differenciation is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what we need to look at carefully. We can assume that the differentiated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entities exist a priori, like numbers, but if we errace all vestiges of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means to &quot;know a difference&quot; such as an observer, what coherence remains?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Numbers, in-themselves (dasein), are meaningless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;In boiling water, the water (substance) changes temperature, the event at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;which all the water has passed temperature 'd' requires no inherent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;'becoming' to make sense temporally, it just needs to 'identify' the state 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of the water at that time, doesnt it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Your claim here depends on looking only at an abstract slice 'd' that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has some quantitative value within some assumed coordinate system; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;temperature vs. time. This is going back to the cellular automata results 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where I pointed out that the range of values over the checker board of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;results can only be taken after the act of rendering the result, not prior 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Does a &quot;history&quot;&quot; include values that can be associated with either of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;McTaggart's A or B series? No! It has boundaried at some initial point and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;spans to some &quot;present moment&quot;. Again, we are considering an order of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events after the fact of their ordering. The &quot;measure of change&quot; aspect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;goes from the 1st person aspect of &quot;being there as the history was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happening&quot; to the 3rd person aspect of comparing the events at one date of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a history to another.
