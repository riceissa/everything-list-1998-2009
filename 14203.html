GL: &quot;&gt; *The implication of the question seems to be that the

questioner (Q)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could have been born in either of the two populations at random, and, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assuming the number of people in the Galactic Empire is sufficiently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immense, the probability that he could have been born on Earth is close 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to nil.*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *But Q could not have been born in either of the two populations; he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could only have been born on Earth, and his failure to realize this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggests that he has ignored his own material and biological nature.*

<br />MP: That does seem to be the essence of it. Another way to look 
<br />
at it - which as an arithmetical failure I much prefer - is to 
<br />
recognise that, however wonderful the processes underlying one's 
<br />
self-awareness are, what it comes down to is that the experience 
<br />
of being here now is what it is like to be the universe 
<br />
observing itself from a particular point of view, and no other 
<br />
point of view. All the rest is just imagination.
<br />
<br />At other times when I have made this statement, some people have 
<br />
criticised the formulation on the grounds of 'too metaphysical' 
<br />
or just 'too grandiose'. But I think that all such denials 
<br />
depend on the imposition of arbitrary boundaries. Such 
<br />
boundaries and conventions of thought are the very stuff of 
<br />
social life maybe but if we want to be REAL then we have to be 
<br />
'here' and 'now'. This entails recognising that here and now 
<br />
have come about in consequence of every force and movement 
<br />
causally antecedent to all the events and processes which make 
<br />
up the experience of being the construction which is the 
<br />
rendition of this body's model of self in the world. Sounds 
<br />
complicated, but the complexity is mostly about having enough 
<br />
self-referencing systems happening together to construct/be the 
<br />
awareness. The underlying simplicity is that if something really 
<br />
exists, even if that something is just a 'point of view', then 
<br />
it has to be somewhere now, not somewhere else.
<br />
<br />Thanks for the interesting question!
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
