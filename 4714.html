Hello Frederico,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've recently been taking part in a discussion on very similar lines 
<br />
on the Fabric of Reality mailing list (yahoo groups).

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My reasoning is rather simple. Dealing with an infinite level 1

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiuniverse, if an event, even an improbable one, doesn't violate any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pshysical laws, it necessarly has to happen infinite times and in infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different points of the space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So we can try to reason upon some examples which has a meaning from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical point of view. For instance, we can think about the second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principle of thermodynamics, according to which the entropy of a closed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system necessarly has to increase. That means that, for instance, a gas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;put into a container of volume V will tend to spread by occupying all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;available volume. This way we get the most possible disorder and the state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the most probable. Anyway the state in which all the gas is firmly in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;v &lt; V volume is not forbidden by thermodynamics; it is just a rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;improbable state. But this event, having some chances to take place, has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to happen in infinite places and times in our multiverse. So there will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinite Hubble spheres in which everything happens exactly as in our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sphere, but in which any time you put a gas into a container, it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;never occupy the whole volume. At the same time, there will be infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;spheres in which some day the gas will occupy all the volume and some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others not. And so on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Yes, this is predicted to happen (in very rare universes) in the Many 
<br />
Worlds Interpretation (MWI).  It's also predicted to happen under the 
<br />
Copenhagen Interpretation (CI), you'd just have to wait a very long time 
<br />
to expect to see such a violation of the 2nd law of thermodynamics.
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; From all these examples we should deduce that, if all the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers we have considered took advantage of the same approach we have,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they would obtain very different interpretations. So the model seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;admit in itself the chance of being wrong. It is consistent with its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;foundamental hypotheses the fact that it is inconsistent. So here we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the paradox. But shall we put into discussion our experimental method just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because some unlucky observers are not in the condition to understand the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe and the way it works?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To answer this question I have tried to go even further with my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reflection. I believe we have no reason to think of being privileged
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers just because we observe the universe moving according to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical laws. Moreover, physics has been formunlated just starting from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our observations, so it is clear that our models come out to be consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with them. If these observations were not like that, we would discard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them. But the same thing would be valid for all the other infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observers and any of them could think of being privileged. Besides, from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one day to another, we could also realize that all our models are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;longer valid. What would happen if we lived in an Hubble sphere in which,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by chance, entropy began to lower all of a sudden?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
We can call these universes where strange things that seem forbidden by 
<br />
our statistical laws of physics (which are not fundamental) happen 
<br />
regularly through shear chance 'magical'.  I believe your question could 
<br />
be rewritten, is there any evidence that we are not living in such a 
<br />
'magical' universe ourselves?
<br />
<br />You are quite right that any particular physical law you could construct 
<br />
*could* be the result of observing quantum statistics which have been 
<br />
skewed in one way or another.  For instance, you could be in a 'magical' 
<br />
universe where gases don't expand in line with the predictions of our 
<br />
statistical mechanics/thermodynamics.  Instead, you would draw up your 
<br />
own set of laws to describe this behaviour, assuming that the deviations 
<br />
happen in a systematic way.  Or you could be in another 'magical' 
<br />
universe where even fundamental particles obey totally different 
<br />
equations of motion, as a result of skewed sampling on every microscopic 
<br />
observation of the wavefunctions concerned.
<br />
<br />In order to formulate these laws, the deviations would have to be 
<br />
systematic. Universes admitting such 'magical' laws would be very much 
<br />
rarer than those where the deviations do not permit systematic modelling 
<br />
to occur.
<br />
<br />The evidence that we are not in such a 'magical' universe is this.  
<br />
Though our laws describing the behaviour of gases etc. were originally 
<br />
derived from observations of large amounts of gases - macroscopic 
<br />
investigation - we have since found that they are 100% bconsistent with 
<br />
our observations of single particles of gas - microscopic investigation.
<br />
<br />In 'magical' universes, we would not expect this consistency.  
<br />
Observations of large amounts of gas would not be consistent with 
<br />
measurements made on individual particles in the vast majority of these 
<br />
universes.  The fact that these two sets of laws of physics are 
<br />
consistent indicates that we are not in a 'magical' universe with very 
<br />
high confidence - because if we were in a 'magical' universe we would be 
<br />
far more likely to have inconsistent macroscopic and microscopic physics.
<br />
<br />I should point out that there does remain a vanishingly small 
<br />
possibility that we could be in one of the extremely 'magical' universes 
<br />
where both macroscopic and microscopic laws of physics are skewed in a 
<br />
mutually consistent way, however given the tiny probability of this 
<br />
being the case I think it is quite safe to ignore it.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt.
