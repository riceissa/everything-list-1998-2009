<br /><br />What is it that you (still) don't understand? (good idea to resume UDA  
<br />
again, and so the question is asked also to the newbies).
<br />
Please help yourself by printing  the  PDF slide
<br />
<br /><br />1) The (re)definition of computationalism, or digital mechanism, in  
<br />
the form of &quot;yes doctor&quot; + Church thesis? Note that the list has  
<br />
convince me to suppress the &quot;arithmetical realism&quot; hypothesis, because  
<br />
it is contained in the &quot;Church thesis&quot;, and some people put to much  
<br />
metaphyical baggage in the word &quot;realism&quot;. (step 1).
<br />
<br /><br />2) The first person/third person distinction (like Schmidhuber, who  
<br />
leaves the list after complaining this distinction made no sense)?  Is  
<br />
it the invariance of the first person experience for the addition of  
<br />
third person delays which makes problem? (step 2)
<br />
<br /><br />3) have you a problem with the first person indeterminacy in self- 
<br />
duplication experience (my main old contribution) like Chalmers, who  
<br />
lives the room at this step when I explained UDA at the ASSC meeting  
<br />
in Brussels many years ago? (step 3)
<br />
<br /><br />4) The invariance of any method for quantifying first person  
<br />
indeterminacy with respect to the addition of asymmetrical delays?  
<br />
(step 4)
<br />
<br /><br />5) The same in experiences where the third person &quot;original&quot; is not  
<br />
annihilated? (step 5)
<br />
<br /><br />6) The same in experiences where the reconstitution, although still  
<br />
&quot;physical&quot; are virtual (step 6).
<br />
<br /><br />Most people have no problem up to here. Sometimes Brent Meeker  
<br />
complains that I should make clearer that the environment can still  
<br />
play some role at this stage, but this is part of my definition of  
<br />
&quot;generalized brain&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;7) So, is it in the seventh step: where you are in front of a  
<br />
concrete never ending running of a Universal Dovetailer?  Do you have  
<br />
a problem with the idea of universal dovetailing? (step 7)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I could tell you what's wrong with his MGA, ....
</em><br />
<br /><br />8) Are you acknowledging you get the UDA (1...7)? It is just UDA_8 you  
<br />
have some trouble with? Then it means you have made some progress  
<br />
since our last conversation. I could stop here, because MGA can be  
<br />
eliminated with some Occam Razor. MGA is really the little cerise on  
<br />
the top of the cake.  I do have been myself a bit annoyed by its  
<br />
subtle taste and difficulty until I discovered recently, through  
<br />
conversation with patient (and polite) people in the list,  that the  
<br />
difficulties reside more in a too quick understanding of the seventh  
<br />
step than in MGA per se. Many are not always clear about the  
<br />
distinction between what is a computation (in Platonia), and a  
<br />
description of a computation (in platonia). The progress is that I  
<br />
have now a version of MGA in two steps: MGA1 and MGA2. Forget MGA3: it  
<br />
is a product of my non awareness that the seventh step has to be  
<br />
exposed with more caution, especially to non-mathematician. This is  
<br />
what I am planning to do, with the help of Kim, and this includes to  
<br />
start the math (needed here) from scratch. The hope is to make the  
<br />
ending of the UDA, and the beginning of the AUDA, more available to a  
<br />
wider audience.
<br />
<br />Concerning your paper I have nothing to add that has not been already  
<br />
told or asked to you. Obviously it does not take into account the  
<br />
Universal Dovetailer Argument.
<br />
<br />I see you have make some progress on the subject (but not yet on  
<br />
diplomacy, unless your &quot;crackpot&quot; wording is just an affectionate  
<br />
mark: I could be OK with that. Well we will see).
<br />
<br />Welcome back to the list Jacques,
<br />
<br />Bruno
