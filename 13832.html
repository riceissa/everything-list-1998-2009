Hi Mirek,
<br />
<br />Welcome to the list,
<br />
<br />Le 13-août-07, à 16:54, Mirek Dobsicek a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hello Bruno !
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am a freshman to this list and it seems to me that some kind of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'course' is going to happen.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Let us say that I try to give some information linking my (already old) 
<br />
work and the main discussion on this list.
<br />
<br />In the case you know french the most extensive description of what I 
<br />
have done is in &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot;, or in some preceding papers.
<br />
In English my last papers could perhaps help, you can find them here:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications.html">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I checked a couple of last messages and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; looks interesting. Please, would you mind to repeat what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approximately the starting point of your explanations and where do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aim? Hopefully, I'll be able to follow.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The starting point of this list is the idea that &quot;everything exist&quot; 
<br />
could be an easier explanation than any assumption of the kind 
<br />
&quot;something exists&quot;.
<br />
My own starting point is what I called the &quot;indexical digital mechanist 
<br />
thesis&quot;, which is called also &quot;computationalism&quot;, and which is a 
<br />
digital version of Milinda-Descartes mechanism thesis. When Milinda 
<br />
asked Nagarjuna, what is the nature of a person, Nagarjuna answered by 
<br />
an informal exposition of the mechanist thesis.
<br />
What I show (or try to show) is that once we take the idea that &quot;I am a 
<br />
machine&quot; seriously enough, then this entails a reversal between physics 
<br />
and &quot;intensional number theory&quot;, or &quot;mathematical computer science&quot; or 
<br />
(as I can justify) &quot;machine theology&quot;, and this in a sufficiently 
<br />
precise way so that the physics extracted from the computationalist 
<br />
&quot;machine theology&quot; can be compared with the empirical facts.

<br /><br />Thanks for saying; it is indeed a key point, which, I realize now,  is 
<br />
rarely understood, although in my opinion Emil Post has seen this point 
<br />
in the 1920, and Judson Webb has written a genuine book in the 1980 
<br />
(ref in my thesis).
<br />
<br />But at the computability meeting in Siena 2007, I have heard that some 
<br />
people still believe that Church thesis could be viewed as a definition 
<br />
(of computable function), which, as I hope being able to explain, is 
<br />
complete  nonsense.  Actually, when Church did propose what he did 
<br />
consider as a definition, Stephen Kleene makes clear it has to be a 
<br />
thesis (i.e. an hypothesis). I will come back on this.
<br />
<br />I will have to come back on Cantor. Meanwhile people can consult my old 
<br />
post on diagonalization.
<br />
Actually you can search for diagonalisation (with a s) for my older and 
<br />
more basic posts, and then search for diagonalization (with a z) for 
<br />
some more recent one.
<br />
<br />Well, the list archive are no so easy to search in: here is my older 
<br />
&quot;diagonalisation&quot; post, send to George Levy on the list, the 21 
<br />
augustus 2001, shortly after the sudden death of James Higgo.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------- copy of my first diagonalzation 
<br />
post----------------------------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in memory of James,
<br />
<br /><br />Hi George, Hi People,
<br />
<br />I guess most of you know the famous proof by diagonalisation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the uncountability or non enumerability of the reals.
<br />
<br />To my knowledge diagonalisation appears in the work of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dubois-Reymond, but it is Cantor who first used it for proving
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that the set of reals is bigger, in some sense, than the set of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;natural numbers N, or the set of integers Z or the set of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rational numbers Q.
<br />
<br />Here I want recall Cantor proof, and then I want to show you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a weird, similar but false diagonalisation reasoning.
<br />
<br />The  correction of that reasoning will give a shortcut to Godel's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;incompleteness result, which is itself a step toward G and G*.
<br />
<br />In this post I prove Cantor theorem, and then I give you the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;similar but wrong proof. I will let you search the error.
<br />
<br />I hope you see that Q is countable. There are simple
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;drawing proof of that. But without drawing, it is enough
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to realise that a rational numbers like -344/671 is described
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;by a finite string in the alphabet {O, 1, 2, 3, ... 9, -, /}.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And finite strings can be ordered by length, and those
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with the same length which remains can be ordered by some
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;chosen alphabetical order. I call this order (on string) the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*lexicographic* order.
<br />
<br />Actually we will be interested by the functions of N to N.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;N is the set of natural numbers (positive integers).
<br />
<br />============================
<br />
<br />So here is a variant of Cantor theorem:
<br />
<br />1. Theorem: The set of functions from N to N is NOT countable.
<br />
<br />(Note: if you know Cantor proof, just skip it and go to 2. below).
<br />
<br />Proof: (by absurdum and diagonalisation)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;I recall that a function from N to N is just an assignment for each
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;natural number (called the argument or input) of a natural numbers,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called the output or value.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;exemples:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-the constant function:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input   0   1   2   3   4   5   6    ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output  1   1   1   1   1   1   1    ...
<br />
<br />-the identity function:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input   0   1   2   3   4   5   6     ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output  0   1   2   3   4   5   6     ...
<br />
<br />-the factorial function:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input   0   1   2   3   4    5     6     ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output  1   1   2   6   24   120   720   ...
<br />
<br />-an &quot;arbitrary&quot; function:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input   0   1   2   3   4    5     6            ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;output  10  0   0   3   56   1   35465439087    ...
<br />
<br />Of course in this last case, the  &quot;...&quot; has only sense
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in Plato heaven or in God's Mind.
<br />
<br />Suppose now (our absurd hypothesis) that the set of all
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;function from N to N is countable.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that we can count or enumerate the functions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So we would have a sequence of functions, each associated
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;to a natural number such that all functions appear in that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sequence. We would have a sequence:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f_0  f_1  f_2  f_3  f_5  f_6 ...
<br />
<br />of all functions (from N to N, but this will not be repeated).
<br />
<br />Let us put those functions with their value in a matrix:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;input   0   1   2   3   4   5   6      ...
<br />
<br />f_0         4   7   0   0   0   19  5      ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;f_1         8   6   6   2   1   3   49     ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;f_2         66  36  5   2   4   5   8      ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;f_3         1   2   3   2   1   3   2      ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;f_4         1   2   3   4   5   6   7      ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;f_5         10  0   0   3   56  1   356    ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;f_6         0   10  7   2   2   35  0      ...
<br />
<br />..                 ....                  ...
<br />
<br />Now we will get a contradiction. Indeed we pretend that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;all functions belongs to the sequence f_0  f_1  f_2 ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and this makes the matrix well defined (in Plato heaven
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;or Cantor paradise, we don't ask that the matrix can be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;algorithmicaly generable).
<br />
<br />But here is a function, certainly well defined in Plato
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heaven, which, by definition, will not appear in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;matrix. It is the function g which send n on f_n(n) + 1.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g(n) = f_n(n) + 1
<br />
<br />In particular g(0) = f_0(0) + 1 = 4+1 = 5;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g(1) = f_1(1) + 1 = 6+1 = 7;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g(2) = 6;  g(3) = 3; g(4) = 6, g(5) = 2; g(6) = 1, ...
<br />
<br />You see we just change the &quot;diagonal value&quot; so as to be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sure that g is different from f_0 on the value O
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(it is f_0(0) + 1), g is different from f_1 on the value 1, etc.
<br />
<br />Would have g belong to the list f_0  f_1  f_2  f_3  f_5 ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A number k would exist such that g = f_k, but then, applying
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;g on k gives g(k) = f_k(k), but remembering the definition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of g, we have also g(k) = f_k(k) + 1. Contradiction.
<br />
<br />The proof does not depend of the choice of the matrix, so that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;we have just shown that the set of functions cannot be put
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in an exhaustive sequence. N^N is not countable.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(A^B is a notation for the set of function from B to A).
<br />
<br />==============================
<br />
<br />2. A paradox ?
<br />
<br />I will say that a function f is computable if there is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a well defined formal language FL in which I can explained
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;non ambiguously how to compute f on arbitrary input (number).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I must be able to recognise if an expression in my language
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is a grammaticaly correct definition of a function, that is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;syntax error must be recoverable.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All expression in the language must be of finite length, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the alphabet (the set of symbols) of the language is asked to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;be finite.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all finite strings, a fortiori the grammatically correct
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;one, form a countable set. Just use the lexicographic order
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;defined above.
<br />
<br />So the set of function computable with FL is countable.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;A synonym of countable is *enumerable*, and is used by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;computer scientist, so I will also use it.
<br />
<br />So I can enumerate the functions computable with FL, that is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can put them in sequence like f_0, f_1, f_2, f_3, ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;going through all functions computable in or with FL.
<br />
<br />Let us consider the function g defined again by
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g(n) = f_n(n) + 1
<br />
<br />Now, g is not only well defined, but is even computable. To
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;compute it on n, just search in the enumeration f_i the nth
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;function, apply it to n (this gives an answer because the f_i
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;are computable) and add 1.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there is a number k such that g = f_k, but then, again
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g(k) = f_k(k) = f_k(k) + 1
<br />
<br />But f_k(k) is a well defined number (f_k is computable), and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;no numbers can be equal to &quot;itself + 1&quot;. Contradiction.
<br />
<br />Could the set of computable functions in FL be uncountable, after
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;all, or is g not expressible in FL, or what?
<br />
<br />Where is the error?   I let you think a little bit. You can
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ask question. (Notably in case of notational problem).
