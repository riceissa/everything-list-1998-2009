<br />Very precise? T-shirt? Never mind, I think I now completely understand
<br />
your reasoning.  Contradicting my announcement to give up I'll try once
<br />
more to point out your unspoken assumptions and what is unsatisfactory 
<br />
about them.
<br />
<br />You expect finite future observation sequences to be incompressible,
<br />
because most binary strings are incompressible.
<br />
<br />The unspoken assumption is a uniform distribution on equal-sized prefixes
<br />
of possible futures. 
<br />
<br />When you say indeterminacy you just mean probability 2^-n for each prefix
<br />
of size n. There is nothing &quot;shocking&quot; or &quot;weird&quot; about it (your words);
<br />
you just assume one particular computable probability distribution on
<br />
finite prefixes of futures. 
<br />
<br />That's ok. Although it does represent a limitation, because there are many
<br />
other computable probability distributions on possible universe histories,
<br />
and theories of everything (TOEs) should take all of them into account.
<br />
<br />Then, however, you make a bold step and generalize from computable things
<br />
to noncomputable things: you expect infinite future observation sequences
<br />
to have no finite description, because most infinite binary strings do
<br />
not have one.
<br />
<br />The unspoken assumption is a uniform distribution on all infinite strings.
<br />
<br />The problem was pointed out repeatedly - one cannot generalize from
<br />
finite prefixes to a continuum of infinite objects without leaving the
<br />
realm of computation and dovetailers. Any dovetailer producing a growing
<br />
binary tree can output only countably many nodes, never a continuum.
<br />
<br />The issue of 3rd person vs 1st person is irrelevant here. So is the issue
<br />
of enumerating the reals in a &quot;list&quot; - it is already enough to observe
<br />
that in countable time you cannot produce uncountably many things, only
<br />
their prefixes.
<br />
<br />For a long time your claim that &quot;there is no computable universe to which
<br />
we belong&quot; has not made any sense to me, but now I realize that what you
<br />
really mean is just that if our universe is uniform randomly sampled from
<br />
the interval of real numbers then with probability 1 it is not computable.
<br />
This is an ancient result.
<br />
<br />Your underlying assumption is the existence of a noncomputable selection
<br />
process selecting one of uncountably many objects. This has nothing to do
<br />
with your computable 2^-n prefix probabilities above, or with computation
<br />
in the limit, or with dovetailing, or with truly algorithmic TOEs. You
<br />
have a NONalgorithmic approach here.
<br />
<br />To summarize: There are many possible computable distributions on
<br />
equal-sized prefixes of futures.  You pick a uniform one, perhaps
<br />
because unbiased coin tosses seem natural to you.  But as soon as
<br />
it comes to infinite objects the uniform distribution is LESS natural
<br />
than many others, because infinite sequences of coin tosses do not yield
<br />
describable results, and thus do not even exist from any descriptive point
<br />
of view. You seem to think you can save the situation by &quot;dovetailing&quot;
<br />
over ALL infinite sequences constituting a continuum. But the continuum
<br />
is beyond dovetailing.  This forces you to leave the countable and
<br />
constructive realm and invoke your nonconstructive &quot;arithmetic realism&quot;,
<br />
whatever that may be. Your &quot;proof&quot; just restates that the reals are not
<br />
countable, or that one cannot compute universes that are not computable
<br />
in the limit.  On the other hand you do assume the very existence of
<br />
things noncomputable in the limit. This existence does not derive from
<br />
your dovetailer argument, since the dovetailer always will stay in the
<br />
computable realm. So you make a major assumption besides those rooted
<br />
in computability theory.
<br />
<br /><pre>
---
I guess Occam wouldn't like this additional noncomputability assumption,
this assumption of the existence of nondescribable things, because it is
unnecessary, given what we know. There are describable ways of assigning
nonvanishing probabilities to certain infinite futures characterized by
finite descriptions.  Of course, the corresponding describable selection
processes will never select any future that is not computable in the
limit, but we can discard those anyway, because they don't even exist, in
the sense that we cannot even describe them, not even through a dovetailer
which at best can output finite representations of all futures computable
in the limit, but never the full continuum!
Such reasoning leads to algorithmic TOEs as opposed to nonalgorithmic
approaches like yours (or Tegmark's, who does mention Kolmogorov
complexity at some point but avoids details).
As long as the distribution is approximable or computable
in the limit, one can show that only histories with finite
descriptions can have nonvanishing probability, and that only
histories with short descriptions can have large probability:

That's why flying rabbits etc. are unlikely.
