<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my solution.  It takes the problem as stated, but I do make one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;small additional restrictive assumption:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let:  s = envelope with smaller amount is selected.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       l = envelope with larger amount is selected.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      m = the amount in the selected envelope.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Since any valid resolution of the paradox would have to work for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ratios of money other than two, also define:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       r = the ratio of the larger amount to the smaller.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now here comes the restrictive assumption, which can be thought of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as a restrictive rule about how the amounts are chosen which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hope to generalize away later.  Expressed as a rule, it is this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       The person putting in the money selects, at random (not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;necessarily uniformly), the smaller amount from a range (x1, x2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;such that x2 &amp;lt; r*x1.  In other words, the range of possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;amounts is such that the larger and smaller amount do not overlap.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then, for any interval of the range (x,x+dx) for the smaller
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;amount with probability p, there is a corresponding interval (r*x,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;r*x+r*dx) with probability p for the larger amount.  Since the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;latter interval is longer by a factor of r
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          P(l|m)/P(s|m) = r ,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In other words, no matter what m is, it is r-times more likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fall in a large-amount interval than in a small-amount interval.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But since l and s are the only possibilities (and here's where I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need the non-overlap),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          P(1|m) + P(s|m) = 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which implies,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;          P(s|m) = 1/(1+r)  and P(1|m) = r/(1+r) .
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Then the rest is straightforward algebra. The expected values are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        E(don't switch) = m
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       E(switch) = P(s|m)rm + P(l|m)m/r
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                 = [1/(1+r)]rm + [r/(1+r)]m/r
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                = m
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  and no paradox.

<br />This is right, but it's a pretty special case--there are an infinite number 
<br />
of possible probability distributions the millionaire could use when 
<br />
deciding how much money to put in one envelope, even if we assume he always 
<br />
puts double in the other. For example, he could use a distribution that 
<br />
gives him a 1/2 probability of putting between 0 and 1 dollars in one 
<br />
envelope (assume the dollar amounts can take any positive real value, and he 
<br />
uses a flat probability distribution to pick a number between 0 and 1), a 
<br />
1/4 probability of putting in between 1 and 2 dollars, a 1/8 probability of 
<br />
putting in between 2 and 3 dollars, and in general a 1/2^n probability of 
<br />
putting in between n-1 and n dollars. This would insure there was some 
<br />
finite probability that *any* positive real number could be found in either 
<br />
envelope.
<br />
<br />The basic paradox is that the argument tries to show that the average 
<br />
expected payoff from picking the second envelope is higher than the average 
<br />
expected payoff from sticking with the first one, *regardless of what amount 
<br />
you found in the first envelope*--in other words, even without opening the 
<br />
first envelope you'd be better off switching to the second, which doesn't 
<br />
make sense since the envelopes are identical and your first pick was random. 
<br />
But it's not actually possible that, regardless of what you found in the 
<br />
first envelope, there would always be a 50% chance the other envelope 
<br />
contained half that and a 50% chance it contained double that...for that to 
<br />
be true, the amount in the first envelope would have to be picked using a 
<br />
flat probability distribution which is equally likely to give any number 
<br />
from 0 to infinity, and as I said that's impossible. But my argument was not 
<br />
really sufficiently general either, because it doesn't rule out other 
<br />
possibilities like a 55% chance the other envelope contained half what was 
<br />
found in the first envelope and a 45% chance it contained double, in which 
<br />
case your average expected payoff would still be higher if you switched.
<br />
<br />A truly general argument would have to show that, for any logically possible 
<br />
probability distribution the millionaire uses to pick the amounts in the 
<br />
envelopes, the average expected payoff from switching will always be exactly 
<br />
equal to the average expected winnings from sticking with your first choice. 
<br />
There are two different ways this can be true:
<br />
<br />Possibility #1: it may be that you know enough about the probability 
<br />
distribution that opening the envelope and seeing how much is inside allows 
<br />
you to refine your evaluation of the average expected payoff from switching. 
<br />
I gave an example of this in my post, where the millionaire picks an amount 
<br />
from 1 to a million to put in one envelope and puts double that in the 
<br />
other; in that case, if you open your first pick and find an amount greater 
<br />
than a million, the average expected payoff from switching is 0. But even if 
<br />
the average expected payoff may vary depending on what you find in the first 
<br />
envelope, the weighted average of all these possible average expected 
<br />
payoffs should be equal to the average amount found in the first envelope. 
<br />
In other words, if you take the sum over x (or integral, if you allow 
<br />
continuous amounts of money) of
<br />
<br />(average expected payoff from switching | amount found in first envelope was 
<br />
x) * P(finding x in first envelope)
<br />
<br />..it should be the case that this is equal to the average amount found in 
<br />
the first envelope, or
<br />
x * P(finding x in first envelope)
<br />
<br />For example, if the millionaire flips a coin to decide whether to put 1 or 
<br />
two dollars in one envelope, then  the following outcomes are equally 
<br />
likely:
<br />
<br />envelopes contain 1 and 2 dollars, first envelope I pick contains 1 dollar
<br />
envelopes contain 1 and 2 dollars, first envelope I pick contains 2 dollars
<br />
envelopes contain 2 and 4 dollars, first envelope I pick contains 2 dollars
<br />
envelopes contain 2 and 4 dollars, first envelope I pick contains 4 dollars
<br />
<br />Thus the sum above would be
<br />
(average expected payoff from switching = 2 dollars | first envelope 
<br />
contained 1 dollar)*(1/4 probability of finding 1 dollar in first envelope) 
<br />
+
<br />
(average expected payoff from switching = 2.5 dollars | first envelope 
<br />
contained 2 dollars)*(1/2 probability of finding 2 dollars in first 
<br />
envelope) +
<br />
(average expected payoff from switching = 2 dollars | first envelope 
<br />
contained 4 dollars)*(1/4 probability of finding 4 dollars in first 
<br />
envelope)
<br />
= 0.5 + 1.25 + 0.5 = 2.25
<br />
<br />This is indeed equal to the average amount found in the first envelope, or 
<br />
1*1/4 + 2*1/2 + 4*1/4 = 2.25. This means that *before* you open the first 
<br />
envelope, you can rest assured that the average expected payoff from 
<br />
switching is equal to the average expected payoff from opening that 
<br />
envelope.
<br />
<br />Possibility #2: it may be that opening the first envelope *doesn't* allow 
<br />
you to refine your calculation of the average expected payoff from 
<br />
switching. Your example was like this, since although you knew the 
<br />
millionaire used a flat probability distribution to pick an amount between 
<br />
x1 and x2 to put in one envelope, and always put double that amount in the 
<br />
other envelope, you don't actually know the values of x1 and x2, so opening 
<br />
the first envelope gives you no additional information about the average 
<br />
expected payoff from switching. In cases like this, whatever amount x you 
<br />
found in the first envelope, the average expected payoff for switching must 
<br />
also be equal to x. This should be true for any logically possible 
<br />
probability distribution (or class of probability distributions, as in your 
<br />
example) where opening one envelope gives you no new information about the 
<br />
average expected amount in the second.
<br />
<br />Dunno how you'd prove all this though, it would probably require making some 
<br />
general statements about the set of all infinite probability distributions 
<br />
that are allowable and the set that are not (like the infinite flat 
<br />
distribution). I don't think you'd need separate proofs for possibility #1 
<br />
and possibility #2 above, since the second possibility would probably just 
<br />
be a special case of the first, although it could be that possibility #1 
<br />
only happens when you know the specific probability distribution and 
<br />
possibility #2 only happens when you only know the probability distribution 
<br />
was a member of a particular class of distributions, as in your example.
