I can understand that, for example, a computer simulation of a storm is
<br />
not a storm, because only a storm is a storm and will get you wet. But
<br />
perhaps counterintuitively, a model of a brain can be closer to the real
<br />
thing than a model of a storm. We don't normally see inside a person's
<br />
head, we just observe his behaviour. There could be anything in there - a
<br />
brain, a computer, the Wizard of Oz - and as long as it pulled the
<br />
person's strings so that he behaved like any other person, up to and
<br />
including doing scientific research, we would never know the difference.
<br />
<br />Now, we know that living brains can pull the strings to produce normal
<br />
human behaviour (and consciousness in the process, but let's look at the
<br />
external behaviour for now). We also know that brains follow the laws of
<br />
physics: chemistry, Maxwell's equations, and so on. Maybe we don't
<br />
*understand* electrical fields in the sense that it may feel like
<br />
something to be an electrical field, or in some other as yet unspecified
<br />
sense, but we understand them well enough to predict their physical effect
<br />
on matter. Hence, although it would be an enormous task to gather the
<br />
relevant information and crunch the numbers in real time, it should be
<br />
possible to predict the electrical impulses that come out of the skull to
<br />
travel down the spinal cord and cranial nerves and ultimately pull the
<br />
strings that make a person behave like a person. If we can do that, it
<br />
should be possible to place the machinery which does the predicting inside
<br />
the skull interfaced with the periphery so as to take the brain's place,
<br />
and no-one would know the difference because it would behave just like the
<br />
original.
<br />
<br />At which step above have I made a mistake?

<br />-----------------------
<br />
I'd say it's here...
<br />
<br />&quot;and no-one would know the difference because it would behave just like
<br />
the original&quot;
<br />
<br />But for a subtle reason.
<br />
<br />The artefact has to be able to cope with exquisite novelty like we do.
<br />
Models cannot do this because as a designer you have been forced to define
<br />
a model that constrains all possible novelty to be that which fits your
<br />
model for _learning_. Therein lies the fundamental flaw. Yes... at a given
<br />
level of knowledge you can define how to learn new things within the
<br />
knowledge framework. But when it comes to something exquisitely novel, all
<br />
that will happen is that it'll be interpreted into the parameters of how
<br />
you told it to learn things... this will impact in a way the artefact
<br />
cannot handle. It will behave differently and probably poorly.
<br />
<br />It's the zombie thing all over again.
<br />
<br />It's not _knowledge_ that matters. it's _learning_ new knowledge. That's
<br />
what functionalism fails to handle. Being grounded in a phenomenal
<br />
representation of the world outside is the only way to handle arbitrary
<br />
levels of novelty. No phenomenal representation? = You are &quot;model-bound&quot;
<br />
and grounded, in effect, in the phenomenal representation of your
<br />
model-builders, who are forced to predefine all novelty handling in an &quot;I
<br />
don't know that&quot; functional module. Something you cannot do without
<br />
knowing everything a-priori! If you already know that you are god so why
<br />
are you bothering?
<br />
<br />Say you bring an artefact X into existence. X may behave exactly like a
<br />
human Y in all the problem domains you used to define you model. Then you
<br />
expose both to novelty nobody has seen, including you.... and that is
<br />
where the two will differ. The human Y will do better every time. You
<br />
can't program qualia. You have to have them and you can't do without them
<br />
in a 'general intelligence' context.
<br />
<br />Here I am on a sat morning...proving I have no life, yet again! :-)
