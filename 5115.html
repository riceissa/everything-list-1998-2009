<br />
Uh, okay.
<br />
<br />First Stathis:  Yes, of course our preferences have no bearing on the 
<br />
truth of things, but they do bear on how we think about things.  I 
<br />
cited what I consider the moral ghastliness of endless universes not 
<br />
as an argument against it but only as a reason why I have been 
<br />
thinking about it so intently. I strongly share by the way your 
<br />
preferences regarding global bullying, but that is an item probably 
<br />
better left for the activist list.
<br />
<br />Norman and Bruno:  I myself am not defending a dualist position (body 
<br />
+ soul, mind, whatever).  I am prepared to say the body is the only 
<br />
substance that exists.  That does not mean its behavior is 
<br />
explainable in terms of physics alone. 
<br />
<br />Yes, I would say that whenever we think anything, our brains are 
<br />
doing something.  It may just be though -- and i think it is -- that 
<br />
our brains give us the capacity to engage in linguistic behavior that 
<br />
is itself non-physical.  Whether an idea is logical or illogical, 
<br />
whether it is relevant or off the point, whether or not an essay is 
<br />
disorganized -- these are not physical properties.  I  cannot even 
<br />
fathom what it would mean to say there is a physical state that is 
<br />
the irrelevance of a point.
<br />
<br />Bruno, I don't know what &quot;comp&quot; refers to.  Is it computational 
<br />
theory of mind?  In any event, there seem to me no prospects 
<br />
whatsoever on the horizon for eliminative materialism.  Here is the 
<br />
crucial consideration:  Do you think the linguistic exchanges we are 
<br />
having -- point / counterpoint; question / answer are causally 
<br />
efficacious? Is it, for example, a question that causally elicits an 
<br />
answer?
<br />
<br />If so, then the next question is whether the content of the question 
<br />
causally affects the content of the answer.
<br />
<br />If so -- and it seems clear to me the answer is yes, then Norman and 
<br />
Bruno both, do you think we will ever be able to read the content of 
<br />
either a question or an answer off from a brain state or a quantum 
<br />
state?
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, as I have been saying, the ideas we express with 
<br />
language are neither finite nor closed.  Thus, even if you just 
<br />
stipulated that this or that propositional attitude is identical with 
<br />
this or that physical state, you would never, from the physical 
<br />
states alone be able to explain new thoughts and the behavior they 
<br />
lead to.
<br />
<br />Reduction requires not just correspondence but also an ability to 
<br />
explain without the higher level of reality -- in this case 
<br />
linguistic. Again, there is just no evidence for our ever being able 
<br />
to do this. 
<br />
<br />The strongest argument people make against reductionism is that to 
<br />
deny reductionism is to embrace some form of mystical dualism, and 
<br />
that just is not necessarily the case.
<br />
<br />So Sergio:  Yes, what you say makes sense to me.  I agree with you. 
<br />
It is the position I am trying to articulate here myself.
<br />
<br />Martin:  I really like your Bible example.  It also expresses perhaps 
<br />
even better what I have been trying to express.  I am not sure what 
<br />
you mean in your last paragraph. . .

<br /><br />. . .but it strikes me your example, if successful, is a kind of 
<br />
reductio ad absurdum of Tegmark's thesis.  I will have to think more 
<br />
about it.
<br />
<br />I think your other message also came through on the list.  Although I 
<br />
have been defending here a position that is called nonreductive 
<br />
materialism rather than dualism, I definitely have my own mystical 
<br />
leanings and, Bruno, some sympathies with Buddhism, and so am 
<br />
attracted to what you suggest.
<br />
<br />Your idea sounds similar to an idea of philosophers Hegel and, more 
<br />
recently, John Leslie who argued that at bottom the universe is 
<br />
driven if not by a supernatural mind then at least a supernatural 
<br />
ethical imperative -- which, Stathis, some large, arrogant countries 
<br />
continue to flout.
