<br />
After having discussed with Bruno Marchal about our metaphysical ideas, I
<br />
would like to summarize them and to note their similarities and their
<br />
differences. (Bruno, please correct me if I said something wrong about your
<br />
ideas).
<br />
<br />Both Bruno and me do not say we know the absolute truth. Bruno considers his
<br />
thesis as a logical consequence of the hypothesis of mechanism (even I feel
<br />
that this hypothesis seems probable to him). I consider my ideas as
<br />
speculations and I think that particularly in such transcentental questions
<br />
we cannot be sure to know the truth.
<br />
<br />Bruno and me believe that there might be an infinity of description levels
<br />
or approximative theories of the world, but according to Bruno's hypothesis
<br />
of mechanism, there exist one level L at a finite depth which describes us
<br />
completely, and according to my conception of the spirit, there is no such
<br />
level. See <a href="http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/naturesp.htm">http://www.website2u.com/log/text/reflmph/english/naturesp.htm</a> :
<br />
&quot;whatever is the degree of precision reached by a theory, there would always
<br />
remain a part of unknown, of undetermination, which would let a place for
<br />
spirit&quot;.
<br />
According to Bruno, at this level L, our choices are determinated by the
<br />
laws of physics, but at this level, we do not exist : in fact I do not chose
<br />
but the laws of physics chose what my body does. Here I have some
<br />
difficulties to accept the idea of Bruno which considers that we are free
<br />
because we cannot know which machine we are. Is it a real freedom or an
<br />
illusion of freedom ? Bruno does not seem to make a difference.
<br />
According to my conception of spirit, at any level our choices are not fully
<br />
determinated by the approximative laws corresponding to this level, so we
<br />
exist, but the more the level is deep, the more we &quot;become small&quot;.
<br />
<br />Bruno says that if we look at a level deeper than L, we see a fuzzy reality
<br />
(like in quantum physics, but it seems to me that it's fuzzy until we
<br />
observe it : when we make a measurement, we get a determinate value) : our
<br />
consciousness supervenes on several parts of the Universal Doveteller (the
<br />
program which runs all programs) which are so near that we don't perceive
<br />
any difference. But if we look under the level L, there are some differences
<br />
between these parts of the U.D. Bruno compares this with lucid dreaming.
<br />
<br />This made Bruno say that paradoxically my conception is more determinist
<br />
than his conception, because in my conception we cannot find such a level
<br />
below L in which the reality is not determinated.
<br />
According to Bruno, the world is less determinated than the spirit.
<br />
According to me, the spirit dives down to the deepest levels of the world
<br />
and therefore has an absolute existence.
<br />
<br />A problem raised by Bruno's idea according to which our consciousness
<br />
supervenes on an infinity of parts of the U.D. is to explain why the world
<br />
seems coherent. Why for example the table in front of me does not fly in the
<br />
air in most of the parts of the U.D. on which my consciousness supervenes ?
<br />
I suggested to Bruno that in these worlds, other strange things will
<br />
probably happen, for example my brain will explode, and I will not be able
<br />
to perceive anything in these worlds. Bruno has another interesting
<br />
explanation : he thinks that the coherent worlds are infinitely more
<br />
numerous because there is a continuous infinity of such worlds (Aleph 1) and
<br />
there are only an enumerable infinity (Aleph 0) of incoherent
<br />
(&quot;pathological&quot;) worlds.
