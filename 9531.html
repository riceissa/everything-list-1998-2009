<br />
I'll offer my thoughts on first-person indeterminacy.  This is based
<br />
on Wei Dai's framework which I have called UD+ASSA.  I am working on
<br />
some web pages to summarize the various conclusions I have drawn from
<br />
this framework.  (Actually, here I am going to in effect use the SSA
<br />
rather than the ASSA, i.e. I will work not with observer-moments but
<br />
with entire observer lifetimes.  But the same principles apply.)
<br />
<br />Let us consider Bruno's example where you are annihilated in Brussels
<br />
and then copies of your final state are materialized in Washington and
<br />
Moscow, and allowed to continue to run.  What can we say about your
<br />
subjective first-person expectations in this experiment?
<br />
<br />Here is how I would approach the problem.  It is a very straightforward
<br />
computational procedure (in principle).  Consider any hypothetical
<br />
subjective, first person stream of consciousness.  This would basically
<br />
be a record of the thoughts and experiences of a hypothetical observer.
<br />
Let us assume that this can be written and recorded in some form.
<br />
Perhaps it is a record of neural firing patterns over the course of the
<br />
observer's lifetime, or perhaps a more compressed description based on
<br />
such information.
<br />
<br />The question I would aim to answer is this: for any proposed, hypothetical
<br />
first-person lifetime stream of consciousness, how much measure does
<br />
this hypothetical subjective lifetime acquire from the third-person
<br />
events in the universe?
<br />
<br />The answer is very simple: it is the conditional Kolmogorov measure of
<br />
the subjective lifetime record, given the universe as input.  In other
<br />
words, consider the shortest program which, given the universe as input,
<br />
produces that precise subjective lifetime record as output; if the length
<br />
of that program is L, then this universe contributes 1/2^L to the measure
<br />
of that subjective lifetime.
<br />
<br />Note that I am not trying to start from the universe and decide what the
<br />
first-person stream of consciousness is; rather, I compute the numerical
<br />
degree to which the universe instantiates any first-person stream of
<br />
consciousness.  However, this does in effect answer the first question,
<br />
since we can consider all possible streams of consciousness, and
<br />
determine which one(s) the universe mostly adds measure to.  These would
<br />
be the ones that we would informally say that the universe instantiates.
<br />
<br />Now, let me illustrate how this would be applied to the situation in
<br />
question, and some other thought experiments.  Specifically, let us
<br />
imagine three hypothetical streams of consciousness: B goes through life
<br />
until the moment the subject is annihilated in Brussels, then stops.
<br />
W goes through life as does B but continues with the life experiences
<br />
from Washington.  And M is like W, going through life until the event
<br />
in Brussels but then continuing with the events in Moscow.
<br />
<br />Normally we only consider first-person experiences like M and W when
<br />
we discuss this experiment, where the consciousness &quot;jumps&quot; to Moscow
<br />
or Washington respectively, but it is also useful to consider B, which
<br />
corresponds to dying in Brussels.
<br />
<br />Let me first deal with a trivial case to illustrate one of the issues that
<br />
arise when we compare first-person experiences that stop at different
<br />
times.  Imagine a conventional lifetime where a person lives to a ripe
<br />
old age of 90.  Now imagine the truncated version of that which we
<br />
cut off arbitrarily at age 50.  Obviously the universe will contribute
<br />
significant measure to both of these first-person experience streams.
<br />
Which one will get more?
<br />
<br />I would suggest that it is actually the 90 year old lifespan which
<br />
will have more measure.  The reason is because any program to turn the
<br />
third-person record of all events into a meaningful, compact record of
<br />
the lifetime experience is going to have to deal with the enormous gap
<br />
between the fundamental events of physics, which happen at the Planck
<br />
scale, and the fundamental events of consciousness, which although
<br />
small to us are at an enormously larger scale compared to physics.
<br />
This means that the program to do this conversion is going to have to
<br />
be intensively data driven; it will have to identify tenuous and rather
<br />
amorphous patterns of physical events, in order to translate them into
<br />
the neurophysiological events that we would want to record.
<br />
<br />Given this structure, the (approximate) moment of physical death will
<br />
be easily recognized, as it is that moment when the structure which the
<br />
program has been built to track disappears.  The simplest program is
<br />
going to be one that has its own built-in, implicit stopping rule.
<br />
<br />In contrast, a program which stops at some arbitrary time, like age 50,
<br />
is goint to have to be larger, because we are going to have to build in
<br />
the stopping rule.  And given that the average human lifetime is enormous
<br />
when expressed in the most natural physical units, the Planck time,
<br />
it means that expressing the time to stop is going to take substantial
<br />
program space.
<br />
<br />The conclusion is that, for a conventional life experience, the largest
<br />
measure is contributed to first-person subjective records which span
<br />
the whole range of lifetime from start to end.  Arbitrary subsets of
<br />
that subjective lifespan will have less measure than the whole thing.
<br />
<br />Now, back to B, W and M.  As just discussed, the measure of B, which
<br />
corresponds to a life which ends in Brussels, is likely to be relatively
<br />
substantial.  However this hypothetical teleporting or copying machine
<br />
works, we stipulate that the guy who started in Brussels is not there a
<br />
moment later.  It's likely that a straightforward program which has been
<br />
tracking neural events by virtue of their exceedingly slight impact
<br />
on the Planck scale is going to be thrown off by this new process.
<br />
Therefore a relatively simple program can output subjective record B.
<br />
<br />When we consider W and M (revivals in Washington and Moscow respectively)
<br />
there is still probably a fairly small program that can produce those
<br />
records.  The main additional complication is that the program has to
<br />
somehow be designed to be able to pick up the trail in the new city,
<br />
to jump from recording neural events in Brussels to recording them in
<br />
Washington or Moscow.
<br />
<br />This could be done in a couple of ways.  The simplest would be to
<br />
hard-code the location of the new version of the person, perhaps
<br />
as a vector from the old one.  But this could take quite a bit of
<br />
information, as it might have to be accurate to the size of a synapse,
<br />
a few nanometers.  Probably a better way would be to track whatever
<br />
physical event carries the causal signal from Brussels to the destination.
<br />
Presumably something has to travel between the cities, carrying the
<br />
information about the person, to allow him to be reconstructed at the
<br />
destination(s).  Whatever this effect or principle is, we could write a
<br />
program which was able to follow this signal, as the neural activities in
<br />
Belgium are being scanned or whatever.  This would allow identifying the
<br />
location of the new instance of the person, without having to hard-code
<br />
the precise coordinates.  The third-person universe data would tell us
<br />
where to look.
<br />
<br />This would probably not be too complicated a program, but it is
<br />
nevertheless going to be substantially larger than program B.  B only had
<br />
to track neural events.  W and M have to be able to track both neural
<br />
events and whatever physical principles are utilized by this copying
<br />
and transmission process.  W and M are therefore going to have to have
<br />
two different analysis methods, compared to one for B.  They should not
<br />
have to be twice as big, since they don't have to actually track thought
<br />
during the transmission (we assume that thought is suspended during that
<br />
time), they just have to figure out where the new brain is being built.
<br />
But chances are it is going to make W and M quite a bit larger than B.
<br />
<br />Compared to each other, W and M are probably almost identical.  The only
<br />
difference is that they make arbitrary different choices for which signal
<br />
to follow in tracking the copying information, in order to find where the
<br />
new instance is located.  Maybe one has a 1 bit where the other has a 0.
<br />
In all other respects the two programs are identical, and their measure
<br />
should be the same.
<br />
<br />But, as noted above, B is substantially smaller, and as a result, B has
<br />
a substantially larger measure.  This means that the contribution of this
<br />
third-person record of universe events to a subjective, first-person life
<br />
experience that ends in Brussels is much larger than to an experience
<br />
which continues in either Washington or Moscow.
<br />
<br />If we consider these as three hypothetical people, one who dies in
<br />
Brussels, one who continues in Washington, and one who continues in
<br />
Moscow, it is the first one who is instantiated to the substantially
<br />
greatest degree by the operation of such a copying machine as we are
<br />
considering.  Informally, we could say that your most likely experience
<br />
is that you will die in Brussels (bearing in mind the formal statement
<br />
in the previous sentence).  That is how I would analyze it based on
<br />
computational principles.
