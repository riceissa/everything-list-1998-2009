Hal has brought up Huw Price's book, &quot;Time's Arrow and Arhimedes' 
<br />
Point,&quot; and especially the thermodynamic/entropy arguments related to 
<br />
recurrence a la Poincare, Boltzmann, and others.
<br />
<br />A point Price makes several times is th
<br />
<br />&quot;..though it needs to be borne in mind that not everyone had a clear 
<br />
grasp of the fact that the low-entropy past is itself in need of 
<br />
explanation.&quot; (p 37)
<br />
<br />&quot;In sum, the puzzle is not about how the universe reaches a state of 
<br />
high entropy, but about how it comes to be starting from a low one.&quot; (p 
<br />
40)
<br />
<br />&quot;For all their intrinsic interest, then, the new methods of nonlinear 
<br />
dynamics do not throw new light on the asymmetry of thermodynamics. 
<br />
Writers who suggest otherwise have failed to grasp the real puzzle of 
<br />
thermodynamics--Why is entropy low in the past?--and to see that no 
<br />
symmetric theory could possibly yield the kind of conclusions they claim 
<br />
to draw.&quot; (p 44)
<br />
<br />&quot;There is no separate problem as to why entropy in branch systems always 
<br />
increases towards the future, in other words: only the big problem was 
<br />
in the bottle in the first place.&quot; (p 45)
<br />
<br />And so on. Price repeatedly bases many arguments on his dissatisfaction 
<br />
with assuming a state of high order. (To be fair, his book is an 
<br />
interesting romp through many theories of time asymmetry, touching on 
<br />
Feynman-Wheeler absorber theories, delayed choice experiments in quantum 
<br />
mechanics, psychology, etc. Not a bad place to get exposed to a lot of 
<br />
the current issues. Just don't take his particular &quot;crotchet&quot; too 
<br />
seriously, is my advice.)
<br />
<br />Frankly, I don't worry how the beer got in the bottle (one of his 
<br />
example, about gas expanding out of a beer bottle...Price worries that 
<br />
the analysts of time are not asking proper questions about how the beer 
<br />
came to be in the bottle in the first place...most of us, dullards that 
<br />
we are, assume that a bottling company _put_ the beer in the bottle!.
<br />
<br />I'm not being flip. It's an observed fact of our universe, and likely 
<br />
derivable from anthropic arguments, that there's a lot of &quot;free energy&quot; 
<br />
around: a lot of unfused hydrogen, a lot of gravitational potential 
<br />
energy, a lot of stored chemical energy, etc. How this came to be from 
<br />
&quot;first principles&quot; from an initial singularity is of course unknown at 
<br />
this time.
<br />
<br />Time for a digression. The classic urn experiment, with Price's 
<br />
objections.
<br />
<br />And let me throw in something several members of this list will likely 
<br />
appreciate: a bet on the outcomes (a la Bayesian reasoning, a la market 
<br />
processes, a la Robin Hanson's idea futures, a la probabalistic 
<br />
definitions of the truth).
<br />
<br />Imagine two urns. Imagine, say, 500 black stones and 500 white stones. A 
<br />
person is reaching inside one urn, removing a stone, transferring it to 
<br />
the other urn, picking up a stone &quot;at random&quot; (a regrettably loaded 
<br />
term, but one which will hopefully become clearer...imagine that the man 
<br />
is blind and cannot possibly see the color of the stone he is picking 
<br />
up).
<br />
<br />A group of people is show two filmed sequences:
<br />
<br />In Sequence One, the two urns are filled with stones of mixed color at 
<br />
the start of the film. As the main transfers stones, the number of black 
<br />
and white stones in each of the urns fluctuates, but there are never, in 
<br />
this particular film, any excursions outside the ratio 450 of one color 
<br />
to 550 of the other.
<br />
<br />In Sequence Two, the the film begins rolling with one urn filled with 
<br />
white stones and the other urn filled with black stones. The man reaches 
<br />
in, takes a white stone, transfers it to the other urn. He reaches in, 
<br />
takes a black stone, transfers it to the first urn. As the film 
<br />
progresses, the two urns eventually reach a state where each has about 
<br />
250 white stones and about 250 black stones.
<br />
<br />The group is told that one of the films is presented in correct 
<br />
chronological order while the other is presented in reverse 
<br />
chronological order.
<br />
<br />The group is told that bets will be taken on which is which. Oddsmakers 
<br />
are standing by. A terminal linked to the Idea Futures Market is 
<br />
available.
<br />
<br />(The Barbourian jumps up and yells &quot;There is no time! All events happen 
<br />
at the same time!&quot; The organizer says &quot;Fine, but I'm still taking bets. 
<br />
The Barbourian sits down.)
<br />
<br />Which way would you bet? And what do think oddsmakers would make odds?
<br />
<br />Not surprisingly, nearly everyone will bet that Sequence Two was shown 
<br />
in correct chronological order and that Sequence One, if one of the two 
<br />
sequences was shown in reverse chronological order, must have been the 
<br />
one that was reversed.
<br />
<br />(The Quibbler points out that Sequence One could easily be shown in 
<br />
chronological order, just either a long time after the mixing started or 
<br />
starting with an initially mixed set. &quot;Sure,&quot; the organizer points out, 
<br />
&quot;but I told you one was in correct order, one was reversed, so place 
<br />
your bets.&quot;)
<br />
<br />Now the urn example is one that does not use the &quot;molecular chaos&quot; that 
<br />
Huw Price is so critical of in &quot;gas mixing&quot; examples, arguing that 
<br />
&quot;molecular chaos&quot; is assuming the conclusion.
<br />
<br />Here we have a simple, discrete, mixing problem.
<br />
<br />Is urn mixing &quot;reversible&quot;? Sure, though very, very unlikely. Unless the 
<br />
man doing the blind mixing (not looking at the color, or unable to see 
<br />
the color, etc.), the odds of a reversal back to the original 500 
<br />
white/500 black configuration is a simple matter of odds 
<br />
calcualations--on the order of 2^(-500).
<br />
<br />Now the Priceian would argue, from what I have read of his book, that 
<br />
while he agrees that nearly all people would correctly bet which of the 
<br />
films was time reversed and which was not, that they are missing the 
<br />
point, that the real issue is how the urns came to have 500 white balls 
<br />
in one urn and 500 black balls in the other urn in the first place.
<br />
<br />Feh. This crotchet, this hangup, is one of the main reasons I can't get 
<br />
overly excited by Huw Price's analysis of time.
<br />
<br />And I certainly don't draw the same conclusions he draws about how the 
<br />
initial low entropy state of such systems must come from 
<br />
Poincare/Boltzmann recurrences.
<br />
<br />I don't _know_ where the free energy or high initial order of the 
<br />
universe came from. But I sure don't believe that 10^80 or more 
<br />
particles in the Universe, following 10^10^10^10^10^.....10 different 
<br />
ballistic trajectories--not even counting Planck-scale effects, will 
<br />
&quot;every now and then fluctuate into this low entropy configuration that 
<br />
is us.&quot; (my phrasing, not Price's)
<br />
<br />But there are other interesting things in the book, more so than in many 
<br />
other books on time and time asymmetry. As I said, a good read.
<br />
<br /><br />--Tim
