John,
<br />
<br />Le 16-juil.-06, à 18:07, John M a écrit :
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. And if someones (1-?)personal &quot;taste&quot; does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accept the (and only) math ways?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can I say: I am right and the rest of the world is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I will ask her/him why. If she/he answers me that she believes in some 
<br />
strong form of NON-COMP, I will say ok, no problem, etc.
<br />
But if she pretends to accept comp then SHE MUST be happy. Why? because 
<br />
the &quot;only math&quot;, at the third person description level, gives a 
<br />
guarantee that, strictly speaking, the &quot;only math&quot; philosophy is false. 
<br />
Indeed, once you take comp seriously enough, you can give a complete 
<br />
3-person (scientific) justification that the first person is beyond all 
<br />
possible mathematical theories. In some sense, Godel's incompleteness 
<br />
and Loewenheim theorems already justified this for the &quot;natural number&quot; 
<br />
or &quot;finiteness&quot; quale;  like I have tried to  illustrated recently 
<br />
somehow.
<br />
<br />I insist on that: comp is a vaccine against a very large variety of 
<br />
reductionism. People who believes that comp is a reductionism are in 
<br />
general confusing comp with &quot;comp + (weak) materialism&quot;. I recall weak 
<br />
materialism is Aristotle's doctrine according to which there is a 
<br />
primitive matter at the ontological bottom. This (comp+mat) *is* 
<br />
reductionist, and could lead to first person eliminativism.
<br />
<br />Of course this lead to some counter-intuitive facts: like the fact that 
<br />
the first person plenitude is bigger than anything we can conceive and 
<br />
still,  is &quot;contained&quot; in the standard interpretation of the natural 
<br />
numbers with usual addition and multiplication. This is a mathematical 
<br />
fact: many mathematical structure are like that: from outside they look 
<br />
minuscule and miserable; from inside they look immeasurably gigantic. 
<br />
Later we will perhaps get the opportunity to say more on this 
<br />
phenomenon which I called a long time ago the Wonderland or Yellow 
<br />
Submarine effects because they are poetically well illustrated in those 
<br />
pieces of art.
<br />
<br />Even just a book has already that feature. From outside it looks like a 
<br />
finite volume cylinder, but when you open it, it could be a path to the 
<br />
infinite understanding of everything ...
<br />
'course this is only an analogy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.You mention Occam, I was in love with him for many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years. Now: I consider his razor-cut &quot;essence&quot; as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulacron, a limited model of the content I just want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to consider (talk abouit), keaving out any further
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ramifications as 'only obscuring the clear view'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />My heart is with you, and this is probably the reason I take years to 
<br />
present my work without invoking Occam Razor (and that is why the 
<br />
Movie-graph should be included in UDA).
<br />
Still, there is a sense we *use* OCCAM all the time relatively to the 
<br />
&quot;empirical world&quot;, for example we believe that if we take a fork on a 
<br />
table, we tend to believe the simplest explanation for such a 
<br />
possibility, like &quot;there is fork on the table&quot;. And we don't believe in 
<br />
invisible horse pulling the cars or things like that. The use of Occam 
<br />
principle's is also easily explainable with Darwin: costly theories 
<br />
cost.
<br />
And the eighth step is made easier with Occam, so, at least for 
<br />
beginners, I indulge in invoking it. But strictly speaking we can avoid 
<br />
it, and that is why I talk of a proof (that comp -&gt; reversal), not just 
<br />
an argument, still less a speculation. Like the proof that sqrt(2) is 
<br />
not rational: you don't need Occam for that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do we want to &quot;see clearly&quot; the part we want to see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly? Are &quot;all possible cases&quot; the selection we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want (or can) include?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />By &quot;we&quot; what do you mean?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the Hungarians?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the Europeans?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the occidentals?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the humans?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the homeotherm animals ?  (about those who dream according to 
<br />
Jouvet)
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the living creature?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the conscious creature?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the Lobian machine?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the machines?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the self-referentially correct machines
<br />
&quot;us&quot; the self-referentially correct entities
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the numbers (who can't really believe that their are numbers)?
<br />
&quot;Us&quot; the persons?
<br />
<br />When I use &quot;us&quot; in a reasoning, I always mean by default the lobian 
<br />
machines/numbers (assuming comp explicitly or implicitly), or their 
<br />
associated first person.
<br />
The &quot;all possible cases&quot; is then handled thanks to Church 
<br />
thesis/Godel's miracle/Post Law. Reductionism is defeated through the 
<br />
mathematical theory of our (cf above) mathematical and non mathematical 
<br />
3 and 1 limitations.
<br />
Comp and Church thesis makes it possible to study the mathematical 
<br />
structure describing &quot;our&quot; ignorance, and this is useful given that the 
<br />
UD-Argument shows that the physical laws emerge from that universal 
<br />
intrinsic lobian ignorance.
<br />
<br />I stop here. I think I should made some effort to make shorter posts!
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
