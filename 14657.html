<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps Hilbert was right and Physics ought to have been axiomatized when he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggested it.  ;)  Then again, there might not have been a motivation to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; until recently with Tegmark's MUH paper and related material (like by David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wolpert of NASA).
</em><br />
<br />The logical positivists were motivated to axiomatize in the predicate
<br />
calculus the laws of scientific theories in the early 20th century,
<br />
first because they believed that it would guarantee the cognitive
<br />
significance of theoretical terms in the theory (such as the
<br />
unphysical ether of maxwell's electromagnetism), and then later
<br />
because it had evolved into an attempt to specify the proper form of a
<br />
scientific theory. In practice this had too many problems and was
<br />
eventually abandoned. One of the consequences of this program was that
<br />
axiomatizing the laws of a theory in first order predicate calculus
<br />
with equality was that such a formulation of a theory always implied
<br />
various unintended interpretations. The amount of effort needed to
<br />
block these unintended interpretations was out of proportion with the
<br />
benefit received by axiomatization.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was trying to answer Bruno's objections regarding set theory being too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rich to be the 'ultimate math' the MUH needs to propose what the universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I quipped that that was because math is invented or discovered to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further its own end by logicians, for the most part, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metamathematicians such as Cantor had no apparent interest in physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things or furthering the pursuit of Physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another question of Bruno's was my motivation.  I started this quest hoping
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that three truth values were sufficient to develop a set theory with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal set that was in a classical logic sense consistent to ZFC set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory.  Or, if not true, prove that and figure out why.  Perhaps more truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; values would solve that.  My main motivation has definitely not been to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;rescue&quot; a major apparent shortcoming in the MUH as I started this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on-and-off quest in 2003 with no internet connection or resources such as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deluge of journals (ie, a good library).  How it started was that someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; online in a place such as this used Russell-like arguments to -prove- that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Physic's universe -does not exist- for essentially the same reasons a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal set can't seem to be non-antimonious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose Everything is well defined along with its partner, containment (such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as the earth is contained in the solar system by the definitions of both).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then Everything does not exist.  Proof:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consider the thing, call it &quot;this something,&quot; that is the qualia of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things that do not contain themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then this something contains itself if and only if this something does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain itself.
</em><br />
<br />I am suspect of the claim that a logical argument such as the above,
<br />
which relies on a paradox of self-reference, could be used to
<br />
demonstrate the non-existence of the so-called Everything. Also, I
<br />
personally remain unconvinced that there is anything problematic about
<br />
the exitence of the universe of universes, or the ensemble of all
<br />
possible mathematical structures, thought it may not be well defined
<br />
at present. I don't believe that this is simply the union of all
<br />
axiomatic systems. If trying to define the Everything as a set implies
<br />
a contradiction, then fine -- it isn't a set, it's an ensemble, which
<br />
doesn't carry any of the connotations that are implied by the use of
<br />
&quot;set&quot; in the mathematical sense. Therefore each entity in the ensemble
<br />
is a unique collection of n axioms that has no necessary relationship
<br />
to any other axiom collection. What happens in an axiom system stays
<br />
in that axiom system, and can't bleed over to the next one on the
<br />
list. Some of these may be equivalent to each other.
<br />
<br />A = The collection of all finite axiom systems
<br />
B = The collection of all consistent finite axiom systems
<br />
<br />The &quot;cardinality&quot; of B is not greater than the &quot;cardinality&quot; of A.
<br />
(Scare qutoes since cardinality is a property of sets and these may
<br />
not be sets if that would imply contradiction.) It is B that is
<br />
interesting from the point of this discussion since it is believed (I
<br />
don't know of any proof of this) that only systems in B could produce
<br />
the type of rational and orderly physical existence capable of
<br />
containing observers who can think about their existence as we do
<br />
(SASs, or Self-Aware Substructures). The collection of all those
<br />
systems capable of containing SASs is the most interesting from the
<br />
point of view of the present discussion, and must have a &quot;cardinality&quot;
<br />
not greater than that of B, since many axiom systems are too simple to
<br />
contain SAS, and the ones with them are expected to predominate.
<br />
<br />The idea of this ensemble so propounded does not seem to entail an ad
<br />
absurdum paradox such as you gave above. Further, didn't I see you say
<br />
somewhere that you don't even believe in sets? I apologize if I am
<br />
mistaken, but if that is true, I can't see how that statement would
<br />
reconcile with sincere belief in the validity of the agument you gave
<br />
above.
<br />
<br />If there is some genuine logical inconsistency in the above, please
<br />
point it out to me as to me this (which is Tegmark) seems like a good
<br />
direction to go in trying to formulate a proper definition of the
<br />
Everything.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By a simple logical tautology (a variant of ad absurdum), this proves that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Everything is well defined&quot; is a false statement.  It also raises doubts as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the existence of this so called Everything.  Maybe this google group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should end?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My quip was something along the lines of, &quot;however, in any ternary logic, ad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absurdum is not a tautology and therefore, can't be used here.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That discussion got me going and while mostly off task, I've been thinking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about this on and off since then.  Basically, my motivation to &quot;rescue&quot; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal set is so that Cantor's dream of formalizing in a mathematical way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some type of deity could be realized.  The analogy would be Abraham Robinson
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is to Issac Newton (on infinitesimals) as Quinne (et al) are to Cantor (on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal set).  Right idea, but never considered using fuzzy logic not to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be delved into much until Lukaseiwicz, Zadeh, and others revitalized FL.  As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it took an army of giants to &quot;rescue&quot; Newton's intuition which was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criticized by another philosopher (Berkeley, akin to Russell) to develop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough tools (compactness theorem), it is taking an army of logicians to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;rescue&quot; Cantor's intuition about God which, and this may be apocrypha, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believed to be his maximally infinite set.  He thought infinity must be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute of God and therefore delved into infinite sets, hoping, I assume,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to reach some type of Omega set that contains all sets and would then be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily the &quot;biggest&quot; infinity.  Cantor proved that the power set of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set is &quot;larger,&quot; however, and settled his own quest in his own way though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm guessing he -desired- the opposite conclusion to have been reached.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Others in the FL army are trying to reach that conclusion which Cantor,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chronologically, would have to have re-discovered much mathematics to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realize in the way this army is doing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So the basic motivation is to find some type of thing with maximality in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some important sense and study it.  With the MUH, now I suspect that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything would be a likely candidate for a literal God and atheism might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to suddenly be the irrational side to be on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So on this note, the works of David Hawkins (a psychiatrist and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spiritualist) inspired me to ponder the following question, along with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark's articulation of the MUH, of course.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which mathematical structure -is- the universe in Physics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suspect it might already exist and has been studied.  
</em><br />
<br />I agree. We could exist in the Mandlebrot set for all we know.
<br />
Determining which mathematical structure is our own universe is likely
<br />
practically impossible, though determining which classes of
<br />
mathematical structures are more likely candidates may be doable.
<br />
<br /><br />It's like finding
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the correct non-Euclidean Geometry applicable to the universe we perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gets us to a GR that coincides with observation (for the most part?).  I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guessing that the universe must have an MV-algebra structure.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV-algebra</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was trying to rejoin Bruno's &quot;too rich&quot; -valid- (imho) objection to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tegmark's approach in his MUH paper by concocting a theory that was far less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rich.  All I need are things and a notion of containment.  I was going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call it container theory.  Then there'd be no need to develop something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strong enough to do numbers, infinite sets, and such, so with those goals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gone, so much more is available to Physics without having to squeeze any set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory or logic into Physics.  It's there, I suspect, in -classical logic-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and recent -algebra- in the guise of MV-algebra.  This area is exactly what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean by thing and containment.  Now if you look at the wiki article above,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observe, firstly, how little there is reliance on sets or non-classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Secondly, I could view all the letters that would normally be variables as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things in the &quot;container theory&quot; I was trying to work on.  In MV-algebras,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the variables represent truth degrees and the carrier of the MV-algebra is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the truth set, the set of all truth values which has cardinality two in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classical logics.  But this seems promising for my 'container theory' which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was assuming someone had done that I just had to find somewhere.  Now if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each variable is now a worldline, one think of it that way.  The carrier of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the MV-algebra is the set of all worldlines in one parallel universe.  An
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideal could be a sub-universe that isn't parallel.  The circle-plus is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of joining and the circle-times is the notion of intersecting or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meeting (to use Boolean terminology which is much more compatible with most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural languages).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The 0 in the MV-algebra could be intuitively compared to that which contains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing or the empty container.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The notion of containment is given by the ordering induced by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circle-plus and negation operator, listed in detail in Siegfried Gottwald's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;A Treatise on Many-Valued Logics&quot; in section 9.2.1 on pages 215-234.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So if each variable represents a world-line consistent with -some- laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some Physics, which vary from parallel to parallel (a parallel would be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideal of an MV-algebra), then maybe this way to view MV-algebras would prove
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting to a Physicist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To glue MV-algebras together into what the multiverse might be, not much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more complex than a simple union would suffice, I think (not having thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; along those lines yet)?
