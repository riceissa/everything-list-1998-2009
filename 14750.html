<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What sparked our/my interest is that you seemed to have

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting argument against the use of anthropic reasoning.
</em><br />
<br />I'm certainly not arguing against *all* anthropic reasoning; every
<br />
argument needs to be examined on a case by case basis.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on reflection it seems to boil down to &quot;there is no mysterious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pre-world of souls hanging around waiting the be born, so there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distribution of observers to be sampled from&quot;. I disagree with this syllogism.
</em><br />
<br />This is where reasoning about conventional cosmology departs from
<br />
reasoning about all-universe models.  In the latter context, it might
<br />
make sense to consider &quot;myself, right now&quot; as comprising a vast number
<br />
of instances who have identical current experiences, but whose next
<br />
experience will be different for different instances.  I might then
<br />
concern myself with adopting a strategy that will benefit a majority
<br />
of my instances, and which can exploit the fact that those instances,
<br />
in their totality, obey some distribution.  In that context, there
<br />
certainly is a distribution of observers to be sampled from.
<br />
<br />But in conventional cosmology, although observers of this form are a
<br />
possibility, they're not a given.  If I really am living, solely, on
<br />
one particular planet at one particular time, then I have never
<br />
sampled the distribution of all observers in the history of the
<br />
universe, and nothing about my experience can tell me anything about
<br />
that distribution (beyond the fact that I, and my fellow humans,
<br />
belong to it).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Assuming for the sake of argument that I can be viewed as a random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sample of the global population, how does this actually help to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguish theory A or B, unless I actually received less than X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kJ/day, which, by assumption is  not the case. I don't see how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anthropic reasoning makes a difference in this case.
</em><br />
<br />I probably haven't made my point very clearly here.  What I'm arguing
<br />
against is what you wrote previously:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My attributes (eg
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; height, weight and so on) are all drawn from distributions of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes. Why not some hypothetical property like &quot;observer class&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as set up in this toy problem?
</em><br />
<br />Why is your height and weight drawn from a certain distribution?  It's
<br />
because you've been exposed to certain statistical influences on those
<br />
attributes, and those influences are influences that you have in
<br />
common with a certain subset of the human population.  But it would be
<br />
absurd to say that *your* height and weight is drawn from the
<br />
distribution of heights and weights of all living creatures in the
<br />
history of the universe.  Equally, it would be absurd to say that your
<br />
observer class has been drawn from the distribution of all observers
<br />
in the history of the universe.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Ultimately this boils down to locality.  I, here and now, do not know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the future, so of course I can't discriminate between rival theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that make identical predictions about the present but different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; predictions about the future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But we do this all the time. Why is it we reject crackpot claims that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world will end on such and such a date for instance?
</em><br />
<br />We reject those claims because they flow from theories that we reason
<br />
should have led to observable consequences in the past (e.g. theories
<br />
of interventionist deities).  So what we have are prior probabilities
<br />
that strongly disfavour those crackpot theories -- and given equal
<br />
crackpot ratings, their predictions about the future are irrelevant.
<br />
If crackpot A tells me that the world will end in 2012, and crackpot B
<br />
tells me that the world will end in 20,012, then all else being equal
<br />
I will (in 2008) give them both *equal* low credence.
<br />
<br />And given two (non-crackpot) cosmological theories with equal
<br />
grounding in modern physics and which imply no observable differences
<br />
up to the present epoch, but wildly different consequences in the very
<br />
far future, we *cannot* use those far-future consequences to
<br />
discriminate between them.  Specifically, we cannot use differences in
<br />
the numbers of future observers in various classes that the different
<br />
theories predict, in order to favour one theory over another, here and
<br />
now.
