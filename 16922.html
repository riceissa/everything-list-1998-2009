<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when you remarked:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to explain.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It reflects my 'totality' based worldview: an interrelated  world,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ALL elements in relation with ALL elements - securing the image of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isolated, (not even elements within a set) it would 'create' havock  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in theories we try to learn/formulate.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I build on what 99% of people know or remember of arithmetic. It is  
<br />
not really the time to re-evaluate them, it is on the contrary the  
<br />
time to remember them, and use them.
<br />
<br />There is no magic, it asks for works. But here just ask question when  
<br />
you don't understand a solution to an exercise, for example.  
<br />
Mathematical intuitions about some object comes from playing with  
<br />
those objects. It needs a minimum amount of exercise and practice, for  
<br />
not being fool by the superficial choice of the words.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM: &quot;...Be careful with the term &quot;uncountable&quot; which will have a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise technical meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I call 'uncountable' what we cannot count (in toto)
</em><br />
<br />Good try.
<br />
But what do you mean by &quot;we&quot; ? I asked you that question before. We  
<br />
the humans? We the mammals? We the animals? We the live being? We the  
<br />
universal numbers? We use the universal numbers with oracle, ...
<br />
And then there is the problem to define &quot;count&quot;, which is a very  
<br />
interesting unsolved problem. But there are progress: we can explain  
<br />
why universal machine have difficulties when they try to define  
<br />
concept like &quot;0, 1, 2, 3 ...&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - the effects exercised on items within a set (as well as on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything in the world) by &quot;the rest of the world&quot; to which we have  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only a limited access - eo ipso we CANNOT count the unknown part.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Infinite IMO is uncountable, because you can always add 'another' to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it (common sense argument). I try to evade the word 'infinite'  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of too many 'technical' connotations attached to it, use  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather unlimited, which may refer to a finite item of which we don't  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know (yet?) the total.
</em><br />
<br /><br />We, and by we I mean the readers of the posts of this thread, will be  
<br />
invited, I'm afraid there is no escape, of a bit Cantor theory of the  
<br />
Infinites, note the s.
<br />
Cantor discovered the Diagonalization technic, which works in set  
<br />
theory, mathematical logic and computer science.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM: &quot;We will axiomatized some mathematical notions, but only when we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are sure that we get the intuition right. The reason will NOT be a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; search of explicit rigor, but will be related in helping universal  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine to get the &quot;understanding&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I appreciate the 'axiomatize' what I understand as retrospect  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulations to make our theories workable. Not vice versa.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, yes, yes. Important to always keep this in mind. Theories/ 
<br />
machines/numbers are tools, they just push light on something, but  
<br />
they can introduce shapes and shadows themselves.
<br />
Be careful now of not confusing a theory and the &quot;betted things&quot; the  
<br />
theory is supposed to talk about. In the case of numbers and machine  
<br />
they can be both the studying thing and the studied things, and this  
<br />
makes some hard to predict surprises if I can say.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I feel the paragraph as 'reverse thinking': our intuition is the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; working of our human mindset, I would not apply it as proof for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting the basics right, of which our mindset is a product.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Similarly the 'universal machine' is a product of the human mind so  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it cannot be invoked as evidencing the total which includes the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human mind. (Circularity).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think that the idea that  ''universal machine' is a product of the  
<br />
human mind&quot;  is a  product of your mind.
<br />
And as such I respect that idea as an opinion.
<br />
<br />My opinion is that the universal numbers are indeed the product of  
<br />
universal numbers, and they have only partial controls on the relations.
<br />
<br />But there can be notable historical events like when amoeba invented  
<br />
the cable to develop into what we call brain, which are universal  
<br />
machine/number ...  But this happened before, and after ...
<br />
A more human-biased account could be that the universal machine has  
<br />
been discovered by Babbage, and then by Post, Turing, Suze, Markov,  
<br />
Kleene, Church, and some others.
<br />
<br />Accepting Church thesis, for a theoretical computer scientist it is a  
<br />
theorem, which can be proved  for all enumerable class of computable  
<br />
function known up to now (hundreds of universal numbers are appearing  
<br />
each day, you are using one indirectly), or an axiom, in attempt to  
<br />
axiomatize.
<br />
The universal machine has many names, you know: fortran, lisp, prolog,  
<br />
c, peano, zf, 3-body problem, quantum vacuum topology,...
<br />
<br />But please, I am explaining this right now, or read the literature or  
<br />
try to keep a later train, but it is on the type reasoning, and we  
<br />
have to get some amount of familiarity with computer science.
<br />
<br />You think the Mandelbrot Set is a product of the mind?
<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyl5J33CJcE&amp;feature=channel_page">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyl5J33CJcE&amp;feature=channel_page</a>
<br />
<br />Remember that the definition of the Mandelbrot set M is not much  
<br />
longer than the definition of the circle. It is has been discovered by  
<br />
Fatou and Julia, and Mandelbrot. An important discovery, and I am  
<br />
about sure that, well not really M, but the rational part of C \minus  
<br />
M, is among the
<br />
fortran, lisp, prolog, c, peano, zf, 3-body problem, quantum vacuum  
<br />
topology,... , company.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BM: &quot;...What is the &quot;occamisation of a set&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The application of Occam's razor to cut off all that makes &quot;it&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; harder to understand and concentrate on the easy part. It includes  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the (limited?) understanding of a problem by the person doing such  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'occamization' - whatever he finds just complicating the issues he  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emphasizes. Such issues, however, may reach into the roots of our  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; poor (mis?)understanding. I find 'Occam' the ultimate reductionism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmm.... Here you talk like someone who is a set realist. I am agnostic  
<br />
there. Hmm... I can understand that &quot;set&quot; is an occamization of  
<br />
&quot;concept&quot;, but set is supposed to be as occamized as possible, for  
<br />
practical purposes. So that we can easily figure out the meaning of  
<br />
the most elementary relations and operations on them. Sets are  
<br />
building block to talk about other things, like functions, computable  
<br />
functions, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I wonder if Russell will excommunicate me for that?)
</em><br />
<br /><br />He could as well if he comes to suspect that you try to occamize what  
<br />
I am trying to say.
<br />
<br />The beauty of it, John, is that, with comp, the universal machine,  
<br />
despite its infinity of names, is such that it is able to demolish all  
<br />
attempts, by machines and even many gods, to be occamized.  (By 'gods'  
<br />
I mean entities non emulable by universal machines).
<br />
<br />If the Supreme Secretary or any Ayatollah really knew what is a  
<br />
universal machine, they would send it immediately to a Gulag, both the  
<br />
machine and its universal user, I'm afraid.
<br />
<br />The universal machine or number or whatever finite thing is *the*  
<br />
major discovery. The real heroin of all I try to say. To understand  
<br />
the mathematical root of that discovery is what is needed to get the  
<br />
seventh step, and to understand why a computation is different from a  
<br />
description of computation. This helps for the last step. The eighth  
<br />
step, where you can add &quot;QED&quot;, and, in the least, understand a  
<br />
different conception of &quot;realities&quot; than the current naturalist one.  
<br />
In the most, you understand why it is necessary, when assuming &quot;we&quot;  
<br />
are no more than turing universal, whatever &quot;we&quot; are.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Dear Bruno, thanks for the prompt reply, I wait for your further

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; explanations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You inserted a remark after quoting from my post:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; If you advance in our epistemic cognitive inventory to a bit  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; level (say: to where we are now?) you will add (consider)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; (unlimited) to the names of 'things' and the increased notion will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; exactly match the 'total' (what A was missing from the 'sum'). It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; will also introduce some uncertainty into the concept (values?)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; set.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I am not sure that I understand.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Let me try to elaborate on that: What I had in mind was my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'interrelated totality' view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As you find it natural that 3 (!!!) and 4 (!!!!) make 34 - if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; written without a space in between - representing a quite different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; meaning - (not 07 as would be plainly decipherable: 3+4),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure What you mean by finding &quot;natural&quot;. I have just learn in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; school to abbreviate IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII by 3*10 +4,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself abbreviated by 34.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  so all elements of a set carry relations to uncountable items in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the unlimited totality (even if you try to restrict the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; applicability into the identified  {  }  set. Nothing is excluded
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from the a/effects (relations)  of the rest of the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This sentence seems to me far more subtele than anything I am trying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to explain. Be careful with the term &quot;uncountable&quot; which will have a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise technical meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No singularity or nivana IN OUR WORLD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Your 2+2=4 includes a library of conditions, axioms, relations,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; clarifiers, just as e.g. the equation 4-2=2 includes the notion &quot;NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in ancient Rome&quot; (where it would have been '3')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We will axiomatized some mathematical notions, but only when we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure that we get the intuition right. The reason will NOT be a search
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of explicit rigor, but will be related in helping universal machine to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get the &quot;understanding&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Concerning the natural numbers, the more we will be familiar with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them, the more we will be aware we don't really know what they capable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of, and why they are fundamentally mysterious. But there is no need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; add more mystery than the very subtle one which will grow up. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not obvious, and has begun with the work of Dedekind, and Gödel, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So I referred to the tacitly included 'relations' (I use this word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for all kinds of knowables in connection with potential effects of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other items) implied in your technical stenography.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since the relationally interesting items are unlimited, there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; way WE (in our present, limited mind) could exclude uncertainty FOR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'ANY' THING. Sets included. Occamisation of a set does not make it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rigorous, just neglects additional uncertainty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still have no clues why and how you relate &quot;infinity&quot; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncertainty. What is the &quot;occamisation of a set&quot;?
