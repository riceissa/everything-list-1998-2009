<br />
Hi,
<br />
<br />In this post I will try to make clearer my argument with Lee by using a 
<br />
minimal amount of modal logic (and so it's good &quot;revision&quot; ;)
<br />
<br />Then I will explain how Stathis seems to have (re)discovered, in its 
<br />
&quot;DEATH&quot; thread, what I call sometime &quot;The Smallest Theory of Life and 
<br />
Death&quot;, or &quot;Near Death Logic&quot;, or just C.
<br />
I have never abandon C, but the interview of the Lobian machine will 
<br />
give C again, but through some of its most notable extensions  which 
<br />
are G and G*.
<br />
<br />To prevent falling in the 1004-fallacy, I will use (at least 
<br />
temporarily) the words &quot;state&quot;, &quot;world&quot;, &quot;situation&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;observer-moment&quot;, &quot;OM&quot;, etc. as synonymous. I will use &quot;world&quot; (if you 
<br />
don't mind), and I will designate individual world by w, w1, w2, w3, 
<br />
w4, etc.
<br />
<br />Like Stathis (and Kripke!), I will accept that some world can have 
<br />
*successor* world (successor OMs in Stathis terminology). More 
<br />
generally we suppose a relation of accessibility among worlds (that's 
<br />
Kripke's idea how to enrich Leibniz).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be interested in the discourse which are true at each world, 
<br />
and I will assume that classical logic holds at each world.
<br />
p, q, r, ... denotes propositions. And a &quot;semantics&quot; is given when it 
<br />
is said which one of p, q, r ... are true or false in each world.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I suppose you know some classical logic:
<br />
(p &amp; q) is true if both p and q is true, else it is false
<br />
(p v q) is true if at least one among p, q is true, else it is false
<br />
(~p) is true if and only if p is false
<br />
(p -&gt; q) is true if p is false or q is true
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(to be sure this last one is tricky. &quot;-&gt;&quot; has nothing to do with 
<br />
causality: the following is a tautology (((p &amp; q) -&gt; r)  -&gt; ((p -&gt; r) v 
<br />
(q -&gt; r))) although it is false with &quot;-&gt;&quot; interpreted as &quot;causality&quot;, 
<br />
(wet &amp; cold) -&gt; ice would imply ((wet -&gt; ice) or (cold -&gt; ice)). 
<br />
Someday I will show you that the material implication &quot;-&gt;&quot; (as Bertrand 
<br />
Russell called it) is arguably the &quot;IF ... THEN ...&quot; of the 
<br />
mathematician working in Platonia.
<br />
(p &lt;-&gt; q) is true if (p-&gt;q) is true and (q-&gt;p) is true. I could have 
<br />
said (p &lt;-&gt; q) is true if p and q have the same truth value. The truth 
<br />
value are true and false, and I will write them t and f.
<br />
You can see t as a fixed tautology like (p -&gt; p), and f as a fixed 
<br />
contradiction like (p &amp; (~p)), or add t and f in the proposition 
<br />
symbols and stipulate that
<br />
f is always false
<br />
t is always true
<br />
<br />That classical logic holds in the worlds means the &quot;usual things&quot;, for 
<br />
example that
<br />
<br />- if p holds at w, and if q holds at w, then (p &amp; q) holds at w,
<br />
- if p holds at w, then p v q (read p or q) holds at w,
<br />
- if p holds at w and p -&gt; q holds at w, then q holds at w.
<br />
- t holds in all world
<br />
- f does not hold in any world
<br />
- etc.
<br />
<br />Etc. All &quot;tautologies&quot; will be true in all world (p -&gt; p), (p -&gt; (q -&gt; 
<br />
p)), ((p &amp; q) -&gt; p), etc.
<br />
(whatever the truth value of p, q, r, ... in the worlds).
<br />
I hope most of you knows the &quot;truth table method&quot; to verify if a 
<br />
proposition is a tautology or not. But I can explain or give reference 
<br />
or you could google.
<br />
<br />Remark.
<br />
Note that if the excluded middle principle (p v (~p))is a classical 
<br />
tautology, it is not an intuitionist logic, and (much later) we will 
<br />
met this logic. We live the modern time where even the classical 
<br />
(Platonic) logician must aknowledge the importance of the many many 
<br />
many many possible logics.
<br />
For example in Quantum Logic and in the Relevant Logics, the classical 
<br />
tautology which is &quot;guilty&quot; is the &quot;a fortiori principle&quot;: (p -&gt; (q -&gt; 
<br />
p))
<br />
One of the main utility of modal logic, imo, is to give a tool to 
<br />
&quot;modelize&quot; non-classical logics in a classical setting. But this we 
<br />
don't need to know now.
<br />
<br /><br />KRIPKE:
<br />
<br />Now, and this is the important line, with Kripke, some worlds can be 
<br />
reachable from others; and  I will say that the modal proposition Bp, 
<br />
also often written []p or \Box p (in LATEX), is true at some world w if 
<br />
and only if p is true in each world which are successor of w.
<br />
<br />I say it again:
<br />
<br />KRIPKE IMPORTANT LINE:   Bp is true in w if for all world x such that 
<br />
wRx we have that p is true in x.
<br />
<br />You can read wRx as the world w reaches the world x, or x is accessible 
<br />
from w.
<br />
<br />For example, with a drawing, where the (broken) line represents the 
<br />
oriented accessibility relations (please add an arrow so you see that 
<br />
it is the worlds on the top which are accessible from the world at the 
<br />
bottom:
<br />
<br />p          p
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\        /
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\    /
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\/
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bp
<br />
<br /><br />Let us consider that  &quot;multiverse&quot; M with only three worlds: w, w0, w1, 
<br />
and with &quot;successor&quot; or &quot;accessibility relation&quot; R given by  wRw0, and 
<br />
wRw1. Meaning obviously that w0 and w1 are accessible from w, and 
<br />
that's all.
<br />
<br />Now what I was trying to say to Lee was just that if p is true in w0, 
<br />
and if q is true in w1, then, B(p v q) is true in w0.
<br />
<br /><br />p          q
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\        /
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\    /
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\/
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B(p v q)
<br />
<br /><br />And if the world represents subjective observer moment a-la Bostrom, 
<br />
and if the accessibility relation represents scanning-annihilation 
<br />
followed by reconstitutions, the diagram with w, w0, w1 + wRw0 and wRw1 
<br />
fits well the situation.
<br />
<br /><br />OBJECTION?
<br />
Ah! but Lee could have build an objection by saying that in Stathis' 
<br />
theory we die, or can die, at each &quot;instant&quot;, or at each teleportation 
<br />
experiment. He told us this in its death thread.
<br />
<br />Stathis was doing Kripke semantics, perhaps like Jourdain was doing 
<br />
prose. He suggests to define a state (world, OM, ..) as being &quot;alive&quot; 
<br />
when it is &quot;transient&quot;:
<br />
<br />The state/world/OM... x is &quot;alive&quot; when there is a y such that xRy
<br />
<br />and a state is &quot;dead&quot; when there is no such accessible world from x. x 
<br />
is terminal, or cul-de-sac, dead-end, etc.
<br />
<br />Now in Stathis' theory, we die at each instant and this means that all 
<br />
transient states reach dead-end worlds!
<br />
<br />Now suppose x is alive. This means there is y such that xRy. But the 
<br />
proposition true, t, is true in all world, and thus it is true in y. 
<br />
This means Bf is false in x (by KRIPKE IMPORTANT LINE). It is just 
<br />
false that f is true in all accessible world from x, giving that in y t 
<br />
is true (and xRy). So in any world x which is alive, Bf is false. This 
<br />
means that  ~Bf is true (worlds obeys classical logic). and giving that 
<br />
f equivalent with ~t, this means that ~B~t is true in the alive state.
<br />
What about ~B~t, or ~Bf,  in a dead-end state?
<br />
What about Bf in a dead-end state?
<br />
<br />This is a little bit tricky and I let you think (I must go now). It is 
<br />
important also for getting a &quot;theory&quot; (set of propositions through in 
<br />
all worlds in some multiverse, where a multiverse is just a set of 
<br />
worlds (OMs) with some specified accessibility relation among worlds 
<br />
(OMs).
<br />
<br />The main exercise now consists in finding all formulas true in all 
<br />
worlds, whatever is the valuations of p, q, r in the worlds, when the 
<br />
worlds belongs to Papaioannou multiverse, and I recall that a 
<br />
Papaioannou multiverse is characterized by the fact that all transient 
<br />
(alive) state reaches dead-end.
<br />
For this the first problem is the truth/false  status of Bf in a 
<br />
cul-de-sac world.
<br />
<br />Stathis, dont' hesitate to accuse me of betraying your idea if that is 
<br />
the case,
<br />
Sorry for those holiday exercises,
<br />
<br />Don't hesitate to ask questions, it is cumbersome to explain Kripke 
<br />
semantics without easy drawing abilities (I already regret the 
<br />
combinators ;-)
<br />
<br />I will come back on this asap (or just a little bit later),
<br />
<br />Bruno
