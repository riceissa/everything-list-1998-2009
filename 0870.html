<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christopher Maloney:

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was a little turned off, if I remember correctly, by some

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the book flap, where they described some of your predictions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They're my best shot at extrapolating the developments I see.  One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branch of machine development seems to be roughly recapitulating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution of our own minds, but at about ten-million speed.  It has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progressed from the equivalent of no nervous system 100 years ago to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the very bottom of the vertebrate scale (roughly insect nervous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity) now.  Computer power is growing fast enough to zoom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machines through reptile-, mammal- and human-like complexity over the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next 50 years.  I do my best to figure the consequences of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; development, and make a few suggestions.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry - I meant to back and finish that thought before I clicked the
<br />
&quot;Send&quot; button, but I forgot.  I wasn't turned off that your predictions
<br />
were too fantastic, but that they were not fantastic enough - too
<br />
mundane.  I just glanced at the customer reviews on Amazon.com, and
<br />
I see that my reaction is unusual.  Most people, I guess, still have
<br />
trouble seeing where we are headed.
<br />
<br />I think that as soon as machines become intelligent, we're going to
<br />
see some serious sh** (to paraphrase Dr. Brown in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;).
<br />
Many people believe in a &quot;singularity&quot; of technological progress, but
<br />
I'm not a strict adherent of that (have you heard of it?)  But where
<br />
I think most people go wrong is in imagining that the AI systems we
<br />
create will remain discrete, full-featured entities that communicate
<br />
with each other.  To my mind, that seems like a tremendous waste of
<br />
resources.  I could imagine some redundancy for purposes of 
<br />
reliability and sensing, but nothing like what the human race has.
<br />
I predict that the various AI's will merge and coelesce into a single
<br />
super-intelligence.  The distributed processing power among all the
<br />
computers in the world will be utilized in the most efficient manner,
<br />
with each running a different peice of the AI.  &quot;Robots&quot; will be sort
<br />
of dumb drones, in and of themselves.  But since they'll be networked
<br />
in with the AI, they'll be just like hands are to us - agents of 
<br />
action.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From your book flap, I got the impression that you were describing
</em><br />
teams of robots that were independent and individual, just like we
<br />
are.  That seems to me to be another variety of anthro-centrism.
<br />
But maybe I was too quick to judge.  I've ordered the book now, BTW,
<br />
and look forward to reading it.
<br />
<br />(More below.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; It also notes that, no matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; what happens to us, among all universes there are some in which our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; consciousness continues, and we will always find ourselves in those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; (and never in ones where our consciousness does not continue!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So do you believe in immortality?  Where do you stand on the FAP the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Final Anthropic Principle, ala Tipler and Barrow)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In all possible universes there are always some where your subjectivity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continues, no matter what, and those are where you'll find yourself!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That much I find convincing.  But I never found the logic for an Omega
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point compelling. I don't see why you can't just keep on going and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going on your own unique subjective paths through the space of possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes.
</em><br />
<br />The FAP is not the same as the Omega Point Theory.  The Omega Point 
<br />
Theory is one possible realization of the FAP.  The FAP merely points
<br />
out that if we are indeed going to live forever, then the universe must
<br />
be such as to allow that to happen.  In a nutshell, there must be some
<br />
way for us to avoid the Heat Death.
<br />
<br />(More below)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; For some things that happen (like our brain rotting) the simplest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; continuation of our consciousness may no longer involve the exact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; continuation of the old physical laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Huh?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The evolution of the universe, earth, life and yourself from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; working of a very simple (maybe null) TOE and its consequent steady
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws must be the simplest way to produce your subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence.  Now that your mind-implementing brain exists, exquisitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolved to certain physical laws, the simplest continuation of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjectivity is surely for those laws to continue to operate as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always.  But in normal operation your body has a finite lifespan: you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see other people die all the time.  So eventually the continued
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; operation of your brain, the mechanism of your subjectivity, becomes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; less and less likely.  To continue one day, maybe you need a lucky
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; escape from an accident.  Later it may take medical luck to keep you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alive: a cancer cell happens to die, some thymus mutation rejuvinates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you a bit, an infection happens to clear some arteries ...  But as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more and more coincidences are needed, your subjective continuation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through the continued operation of physical law may become less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probable than other continuations among the possible worlds, most of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which don't have our physics.  For instance, you may suddenly discover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the physical universe is just a simulation in some other world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with different laws altogether, and as your brain falls apart, your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract subjective processes, without the underlying physics, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;uploaded&quot; into some strange new substrate.
</em><br />
<br />You've said a mouthful.  I think I've said several of these things
<br />
on this list, in particular the point that there is *always* a non-
<br />
vanishing probability that our conscious selves will continue, even
<br />
if it means discovering that we're really a body floating in a tank
<br />
plugged into a VR generator, ala &quot;The Matrix&quot;.
<br />
<br />However, as I was reading your post, I was thinking, the breakdown
<br />
of physical laws must be *very* unlikely.  Perhaps even zero, if the
<br />
measure of those universes is of a different order thant the measure
<br />
in which the physical laws stay the same.  In fact, I think that's
<br />
likely.  Remember that the &quot;physical laws&quot; we witness are all 
<br />
already statistical in nature.  One could even say, there are no
<br />
physical laws!  All we can do is give relative probabilities about 
<br />
the outcome of experiments.  Another way of saying this is, all we
<br />
can calculate are the relative probabilities of what we will 
<br />
experience next.
<br />
<br />I love this quote from John Wheeler so much that I'm going to post
<br />
it again:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot believe that nature has &quot;built in&quot;, as if by a corps
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Swiss watchmakers, any machinery, equation or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mathematical formalism which rigidly relates physical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;events separated in time. Rather I believe that these events
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go together in a higgledy-piggledy fashion and that what
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seem to be precise equations emerge in every case in a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;statistical way from the physics of large numbers; quantum
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theory in particular seems to work like that. . . . The
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;second law of thermodynamics does not go back to any
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;equations written down at the beginning of time, not to any
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;built in&quot; machinery - not to any corps of Swiss
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watchmakers - but rather to the combination of a very large
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of events. 
<br />
<br />(from Ghost in the Atom).
