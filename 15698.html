Hi Kim and all,

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you wrote the plan:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A) UDA  (Universal Dovetailer Argument)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) I explain that if you are a machine, you are already immaterial.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fine. This thought is merely surprising and somewhat (strangely)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satisfying. It doesn't affect the way I live my life, but it sure as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hell gets me some funny looks from people when I try to explain it to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them! Most people think I am identifying the &quot;self&quot; with the &quot;soul&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;spirit&quot; or some other metaphysical conjecture that they have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heard of from religion or from their grandmother. They simply do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; buy it when I tell them that all of reality is like this - that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption of a primitive, primary material reality is probably a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gross &quot;error of perception&quot; albeit quite an understandable one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; People are so hoodwinked by appearances, by their senses. Somehow I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still think we are *meant* to be fooled by appearances - although this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought may well be self-contradictory.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are pointing on a difficult point which we will have to address  
<br />
soon or later.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a good thing I find most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things quite unconvincing - including appearances and reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generally!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Good to be skeptical. But mind the relativist trap.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am always asking myself &quot;What is really going on here?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why are things THIS way, in particular? Why not some other way? I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always been like this. Some people find me quite annoying in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regard...
</em><br />
<br /><br />Don't mind this, though. Except during the feast perhaps ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ---------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) Mechanism entails the existence of a subjective or first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeterminacy or uncertainty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ---------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the sense that I cannot know who or what I am, BEING who or what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am. Correct?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Perhaps you are a little too quick here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would necessarily have to step outside my existence to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do so - manifestly impossible, given the laws of physics (or simply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given MEC/COMP). I would have to reboot from a different system; be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different entity in fact.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This will be possible, in some sense. You are definitely too quick here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Paradox Alert: Without a first person perspective there could be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third person perspectives anyway, isn't that correct?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Just by assuming MEC there will be third person realities conceivable  
<br />
without first person.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why then doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some part of the first person uncertainty (ie &quot;my&quot; uncertainty about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;me&quot;) translate into 3rd person perspectives?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah Ah! Good question.
<br />
You know, the first person knows always very well who she is, despite  
<br />
she cannot tell. In the frame of the UDA, the first person  
<br />
indeterminacy does not concern who you are (you know that even if you  
<br />
cannot translate that in any third person description), but it  
<br />
concerns the more practical (even &quot;physical&quot;) question of predicting  
<br />
who you will be in the next instant, like before and after a sequance  
<br />
of self-polyplication.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anything I might say or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; merely perceive about something or someone else is surely contaminated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by my uncertainties...so, in the quest to &quot;know myself&quot; how can I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trust the veracity of any knowledge that comes to me from outside? All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge comes via brains (wet, messy ones) and all of these brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are suffering the same uncertainties about their identity as I.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is why we assume comp, and then use logic and computer science.  
<br />
We need a theory to provide light.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not a solipsist.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Very good. Let us decide to abandon the comp hypothesis if it leads us  
<br />
toward solipsism. That may still be possible.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, you cannot experience the experience that I experience and vice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; versa. Which is why I think art and music in particular are important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revelations of the first person perspective.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Music is an ATTEMPT to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overcome first person indeterminacy by &quot;universalising&quot; certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualia. Tchaikowsky expects you to BECOME Tchaikowsky when you listen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the first movement of his 6th Symphony. You suffer and agonise and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; die with him. It's a VR experience. Madonna just doesn't do this for  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not a chance for Madonna, but apparently she succeeds with some  
<br />
others, and that is fine.
<br />
I am ok with you here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new research has shown that reading the mind is literally possible. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can now assemble an image seen via an optical system transmitted only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; via the electrical impulses read in a brain system (NewScientist last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ed.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it is not too far from here to the thought that you and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might &quot;swap instantiations&quot; for a short time? Maybe it would be fun to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think, walk, talk and act like Bruno Marchal, if only for 5 minutes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, I would pay a princely sum to have that experience. In an age
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when some people will spend gazillions on a &quot;space tourist&quot; (virtual)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality experience, I would go for the &quot;Be Bruno for Five Minutes&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; option long before I would want to see the globe from orbit....
</em><br />
<br /><br />Kim, if you really insist you can borrow my mind and body, and all my  
<br />
hypostases actually, for as long as you want.
<br />
Just follow the following tips to prevent complications:
<br />
<br />- always: eat bread or rice and drink water (that's my body, really. I  
<br />
need it to say &quot;hello&quot;).
<br />
- in the morning: drink as much coffee or tea up until you remember  
<br />
your 1 times table multiplication. It is enough.
<br />
- in the evening: smoke as much Cannabis up until you forget your 1  
<br />
times table multiplication. It is needed for re-creation.
<br />
- I would be pleased if you could continue my conversation with Mary  
<br />
(you know, God's Mother, the most gentle lady of the multiverse). You  
<br />
will have to meditate two month each day OR smoke Salvia Divinorum  
<br />
(more easy). Mary is gentle but she has her mood, so be careful.
<br />
- If you want to continue my conversation with the Kanabo Gods, and  
<br />
deepen the Bahanarotu, take Nicotiana Tabaccum. The secret of Tabaccum  
<br />
(or tabacum) consists in NOT smoking it. I suggest the excellent  
<br />
african oral tobacco &quot;Makla Ifrikia&quot;. Very useful to make your enemy  
<br />
disappear. Be careful the Kanabo Gods are not gentle and needs a lot  
<br />
of diplomacy.
<br />
- Be super-cautious with Kava Kava, Ayahuasca, Alcohol and Eggs, or  
<br />
please keep your own liver.
<br />
- For the leisure, try hunting the Snark, but beware everything  
<br />
beginning by the letter &quot;B&quot;, like Baker, Butcher, Belgian, Brussels,  
<br />
Bruno, Bugs and other Boojums. Never take what they propose literally,  
<br />
they lie or joke half the times.
<br />
If you follow those tips, everything will be fine until the next brane  
<br />
collision.
<br />
Note that not everything is legal in all universes, so you will have  
<br />
to move, or you will have to vote for the relevant local politicians  
<br />
and wait.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -------------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) The Universal Machine, the Universal Dovetailer and the reversal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics/bio-psycho-theo-whatever-logy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; --------------------------
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - so Abram has been impatient on this point but I guess I am ready
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too:
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you not a bit impatient too?
<br />
Just to be sure, and for the benefit of the others, I give the  
<br />
solution of the problem I gave to you and Abram:
<br />
<br />The problem:
<br />
I multiply you by 2^(16180*10000) in front of a
<br />
(16180*10000) pixels screen, with each possible images (black and
<br />
white) on it.
<br />
And I reiterate every 1/24 of a second that multiplication, and this
<br />
during 90 minutes, that is 90*60 seconds.
<br />
<br />What do you predict you will feel, as personal, subjective, first
<br />
person experience. What do you think is more probable, among:
<br />
<br />A. I will feel seeing a white screen
<br />
B. I will feel seeing a black screen
<br />
C. I will feel seeing a movie
<br />
D. I will feel seeing a good movie
<br />
E. I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot;
<br />
F. I will feel seeing &quot;2001 Space Odyssey&quot; with the subtitle of  
<br />
Caligula)
<br />
G. I will feel seeing a random-noise-movie (what you see on TV when  
<br />
there
<br />
is no emission).
<br />
<br />SOLUTION
<br />
The solution is G.
<br />
A, B, E, and F are, with the above experimental protocol, Harry Potter  
<br />
or &quot;white rabbits&quot; stories. You can live them, but even in that case  
<br />
don't expect them to continue. C and D are ambiguous.
<br />
<br />All right? It is an important point, so anyone should interrupt  if  
<br />
this is not completely clear. Remember that to extract physics we will  
<br />
have to quantify that first person indeterminacy.
<br />
<br />Remember also Kim, that I have still to do &quot;KIM 2.2&quot;. Perhaps you have  
<br />
grasped that your 4m delay problem was a red herring, but I want this  
<br />
blatantly clear for everybody. It plays a key role in the sequel. I  
<br />
will do it for reason of completeness.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I always think of the Sydney Opera House as Platonia. You cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict how it looks on the outside if you are teleported into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foyer!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, the Tardis of Doctor Who has a similar asymmetry between outside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and inside view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you saying Platonia has no outside? The true inside of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outsides - just like the 1st person perspective, in fact.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />(Arithmetical) Platonia is the nickname of one of the possible  
<br />
machine's everything. An everything thing cannot have an outside,  
<br />
because this would mean it is not everything. OK?
<br />
If the physicalists are correct, and if the everything is a physical  
<br />
universe, it too will not have an outside for that very same reason.  
<br />
That is also why, with MEC or Chuch Thesis,  the Universal Dovetailer  
<br />
can be defined as an everything: it has no input and no output.
<br />
The first person notion is more tricky: it cannot have any sort of  
<br />
boundaries. It has really no name. Of course we will back on this soon  
<br />
enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is like deciding to believe only in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the third person description view, abstracting away our experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and subjectivity. Then the &quot;I&quot;, free-will, decisions, and eventually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; are explained  ... away.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes - and then, to make matters worse, we turn the whole morass of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncertainty over to the religionists who reify a metaphysical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstraction which just confounds the whole thing further.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Reification can be done when we don't forget the interrogation mark,  
<br />
and keep the modesty attitude. The real and hard confusion, imo,   
<br />
arrives when we abandon the spiritual or intellectual power to the  
<br />
temporal or political authorities. I think.
<br />
<br /><br />Happy Christmas, Kim and all,
<br />
<br />Bruno
