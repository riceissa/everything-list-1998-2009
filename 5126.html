Infinity has no limit.  If (a big &quot;IF&quot;) there are an infinity of universes,
<br />
then anything that can happen, no matter how improbable,  must happen, not
<br />
only once but an infinite number of times.
<br />
<br />Either there are an infinity of universes or there are not - in either case
<br />
I wonder why?
<br />
<br />I was thinking about the proverbial monkey and the typewriter eventually
<br />
writing the works of Shakespeare.  The first two characters are &quot;AB&quot;.
<br />
Suppose the typewriter had 100 keys and the immortal monkey hits them at
<br />
random.  He would have a 1/100 chance of hitting an &quot;A&quot;, then another 1/100
<br />
chance of hitting a &quot;B&quot;, so his chance of hitting &quot;AB&quot; is then (1/100)^2.
<br />
His chance of randomly hitting 153 characters in sequence is (1/100)^153.
<br />
My arithmetic tells me that if the monkey typed two characters a second and
<br />
typed all the permutations of these 153 charcters with no duplications, it
<br />
would take him 1.165E+285 times the age of the universe to complete them
<br />
all.  If there are, say, 500,000 characters in the works of Shakespeare, the
<br />
time it would take the monkey to complete all permutations is mind boggling.
<br />
And it's still not infinite.
<br />
<br />I guess the point of this is that once we invoke &quot;infinity&quot; we're into
<br />
realms that cannot be comprehended, at least not by me.
<br />

Subject: Improbable or impossible?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hello all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Infinite number of universes... Does it really make possible something
</em><br />
that is almost infinitely unlikely to happen? Take the example of somebody
<br />
tearing apart the Bible into millions of pieces and throwing them in the
<br />
wind. What's the probability of the pieces ending up on the street each page
<br />
side by side in correct order? In an infinite amount of universes, there
<br />
should be one where this happens. I mean, it's not that it could happen
<br />
(it's not any more likely in any other universe), but it really happens. Or?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sure if something like this actually happened in our world, we would
</em><br />
not take it as a random accident, because we would consider it so unlikely
<br />
that it's in effect impossible. Rather we would start looking for an
<br />
intelligent force behind this strange occurrence: The book was originally
<br />
constructed so, that the pieces were somehow programmed to rearrange
<br />
themselves if taken apart? Or a computer was used to scan the pieces flying
<br />
in the air and then controlling a wind machine to direct them into their
<br />
correct places on the street? Anything is more reasonable than a pure
<br />
accident in this case.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The same would be probably concluded in any other universe with logically
</em><br />
thinking people like us. Is it then really necessary even in the case of
<br />
infinite univeses to have all possible situations, even if they are
<br />
infinitely unlikely?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another approach. In any religious/superstition based society this kind of
</em><br />
phenomenon would be considered a miracle, probably executed by a higher
<br />
God-like force. How unlikely is it for such a force to exist in reality?
<br />
More or less likely than the pieces arranging themselves accidentally? In an
<br />
infinite number of universes there should exist a universe with a &quot;God&quot; or
<br />
some other superhuman force, or?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Techically this God could be described, instead of using mythical terms,
</em><br />
as a highly advanced civilization that is too complicated for the religious
<br />
society to comprehend. A civilization (or a member of such) that can twist
<br />
the physical reality, even control the wind. With very advanced computers,
<br />
perhaps incorporated in the atoms of the atmosphere, this would not be
<br />
impossible and it provide a more likely explanation than pure accident.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence if there are infinite universes, there are also several where the
</em><br />
Bible rearranges itself. If it's more likely that this happens as an act of
<br />
a &quot;higher force&quot;, then there should be more this kind of universe than those
<br />
where it happens accidentally...
<br />
