<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see what you mean, of course. However, it's not really what I was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to elicit by my original post. If I were to try to justify my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actions to you in the sort of way you describe above, I don't think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you'd be very accepting of this, nor would much of the rest of society.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't mean to say that there isn't a great deal of hypocrisy and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deviation from ethical conduct in the real world, but unless one is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prepared to discard the project of working together to make things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better rather than worse, I believe that we should take ethical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dialogue seriously. My sense is that much more advanced civilisations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have developed in this area too, not just technologically - for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one thing, they have presumably found ways to live in harmony and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-destruct.  So at the least these issues would have meaning for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's why I feel that your dismissal of the issues isn't very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illuminating. BTW, I don't intend this as a complaint, I'm just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clarifying what I had in mind in my original questions - that it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be interesting to explore the ethical dimensions of possible simulaters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and their simulations. I think you're saying that we can't know and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shouldn't care, which I don't find very interesting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a challenge to your view, might I suggest that in your example re
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the E. coli - if we knew that the E. coli was conscious and had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feelings, we might be more concerned about it. Do you think it's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable assumption that technologists capable enough to include us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in their simulation, regardless of their 'ultimate purpose', would a)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not know we had consciousness and feelings, or b) not care, and if so,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on what justification? Or is this simply unfathomable? I'm not asking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rhetorically, I'm really interested.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David
</em><br />
<br />I am proposing, entirely seriously, that it would only be by incredible luck 
<br />
that entities vastly superior to us, or even just vastly different, would 
<br />
be able to empathise with us on any level, or share our ethical standards 
<br />
or any of our other cultural attributes. Do you *really* think that if we 
<br />
somehow discovered E. coli had a rudimentary consciousness we would 
<br />
behave any differently towards them? Or even if we discovered that each 
<br />
E. coli contained an entire universe full of zillions of intelligent beings, 
<br />
so that we commit genocide on a scale beyond comprehension every time 
<br />
we boil water? I think we would all just say &quot;too bad, we have to look after 
<br />
ourselves.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sentience and intelligence are *not* synonymous with what we think of as 
<br />
ethical behaviour. There is no logical contradiction in an intelligent being who, 
<br />
for example, does not feel physical or psychological pain, or who does but 
<br />
devotes his life to wiping out every other sentient being which might compete 
<br />
with him. Perhaps we could expect that if we were in a simulation our 
<br />
creators might empathise with us if we had been deliberately made in their 
<br />
image, but there is no evidence that this is so, any more than there is 
<br />
evidence for an omnipotent, personal God. The universe was set in motion 
<br />
with the fundamental laws of physics (or whatever), and humans are just a 
<br />
tiny and insignificant part of the result, here and gone in an eyeblink. There 
<br />
isn't even any evidence that human-level intelligence is an especially useful 
<br />
evolutionary strategy.
