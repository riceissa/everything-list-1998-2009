I don't think this is correct.
<br />
<br />A fundamental concept when talking about &quot;emergence&quot; ought to be the
<br />
pattern, or more precisely, the interesting, coherent, or perhaps useful 
<br />
pattern; useful
<br />
perhaps in the sense of being a good building block for some other pattern.
<br />
&quot;Process&quot; is a subset of pattern, in the sense in which I'm using 
<br />
&quot;pattern&quot;. Also,
<br />
&quot;system&quot; is a subset of &quot;pattern&quot;.
<br />
<br />Q:
<br />
How do you know when you have &quot;completely&quot; described a pattern?
<br />
<br />Two examples, or analogies, for what I mean by this question:
<br />
<br />e.g. 1 I used to wonder whether I had &quot;completely&quot; proved something in 
<br />
math, and
<br />
would go into circles trying to figure out how to know when something was
<br />
sufficiently proved or needed more reductionism i.e. The old
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute: How do we know that 1 + 1 = 2?&quot; problem. The gifted 
<br />
mathematicians
<br />
&quot;teaching&quot; me seemed to have no trouble knowing when they were finished 
<br />
proving
<br />
something. It was &quot;intuitively obvious&quot; &lt;-- load of cods wallop of 
<br />
course. And I
<br />
still wonder to this day if they were simply way smarter than me or 
<br />
prisoners of
<br />
an incredibly limited, rote-learned math worldview. The point is, every 
<br />
theory;
<br />
every description of states-of-affairs and processes or systems 
<br />
(patterns) using
<br />
concepts and relationships, has a limited domain-of-discourse, and mixing
<br />
descriptions of patterns in different domains is unnecessary and 
<br />
obfuscates the
<br />
essentials of the pattern under analysis.
<br />
<br />e.g. 2 Is the essence of human life in the domain of DNA chemistry, or 
<br />
in the domain
<br />
of sociobiology, psychology, cultural anthropology? Are we likely to 
<br />
have a future
<br />
DNA based theory of psychology or culture? Definitely not. Cellular 
<br />
processes and
<br />
psychology and culture are related, but not in any essential manner.
<br />
<br />A:
<br />
Let's define a &quot;complete&quot; description of a pattern as a description which
<br />
describes the essential properties of the pattern. The essential 
<br />
properties of the
<br />
pattern are those which, taken together, are sufficient to yield the 
<br />
defining
<br />
&quot;interestingness, coherence, or usefulness&quot; of  the pattern.
<br />
<br />Note that any other properties (of the medium in which the pattern 
<br />
lives) are
<br />
&quot;accidental properties&quot; of the incarnation of the pattern.
<br />
<br />Note also that  the more detailed mechanisms or sub-patterns which may 
<br />
have generated
<br />
each particular essential property of the main pattern are irrelevant to 
<br />
the creation
<br />
of a &quot;minimal complete description&quot; of the main pattern being described. 
<br />
As long as
<br />
the &quot;property&quot; of the main pattern has whatever nature it has to have as 
<br />
far as the
<br />
pattern is concerned, it simply doesn't matter how the property got that 
<br />
way, or
<br />
what other humps on its back the property also has in the particular 
<br />
incarnation.
<br />
<br />And that &quot;level-independence&quot; or &quot;spurious-detail independence&quot; or simply
<br />
&quot;abstractness&quot; of useful patterns is one of the reasons why it makes 
<br />
sense to talk
<br />
about emergence.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;e.g.of &quot;level-independence of a pattern&quot;.

1. The &quot;main&quot; pattern being described
<br />
<br />2, 3, 4. Lower-level i.e. &quot;implementation-level&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;building-block-level&quot; patterns whose own
<br />
internal details are irrelevant to the emergence of the main pattern, 
<br />
which emerges
<br />
&quot;essentially identical&quot; from all three of very different lower level 
<br />
&quot;building-block&quot; patterns.
<br />
<br />So in summary, an emergent pattern is described as emergent because it 
<br />
emerges,
<br />
somehow, anyhow, doesn't matter how, as an abstract, useful, independently
<br />
describable pattern (process, system, state-of-affairs). A theory of the 
<br />
pattern's essential
<br />
form or behaviour need make no mention of the properties of the 
<br />
substrate in which the
<br />
pattern formed, except to confirm that, in some way, some collection of 
<br />
the substrate
<br />
properties could have generated or accidentally manifested each 
<br />
pattern-essential property.
<br />
A theory of form and function of the pattern can be perfectly adequate, 
<br />
complete, and
<br />
predictive (in the pattern-level-appropriate domain of discourse), 
<br />
without making any
<br />
reference to the substrate properties.
<br />
<br />This is not to say that any substrate can generate any pattern. There 
<br />
are constraints,
<br />
but they are of many-to-many cardinality from substrate level to pattern 
<br />
level.
<br />
<br />Why are computers, of all forms, so cool?
<br />
Because certainly any universal computer substrate can generate
<br />
any computable pattern. Are all realizable patterns computable? 
<br />
Probably. Cool.
