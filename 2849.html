<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In Occam's razor, I don't just ignore this problem, I sweep it under

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the rug. At some stage I have said &quot;Theories of Consciousness have

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;bogged down in a quagmire&quot;. I think I must have just said it, as I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;cannot find it written in any publications. Perhaps I want to distance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;myself somewhat from the mud-slinging going on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If treasures were not hidden in the mud, they would not be treasures :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I suspect your words came out wrong here - do you mean &quot;A treasure
<br />
hidden by mud is still a treasure&quot;? Which, of course I agree with. I
<br />
would be ecstatic if someone developed a working theory of
<br />
consciousness. It would be a philosophical triumph. However, I'm
<br />
rather pessimistic of living to see such a theory (modulo QTI being
<br />
right of course :).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Without providing a theory, or even a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;definition of what consciousness is, in the paper I assume 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;propositions to be true about consciousness:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;i) It is capable of universal computation (in order to interpret)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;ii) It experiences time (in order to compute)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;iii) It &quot;projects&quot; out actual events from the set of potential events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i) is ambiguous. And doubtful for most crisp interpretation I try.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For exemple I believe cats are conscious. Cats are capable of universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation only in a very large sense. Still I appreciate, but dangerous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because most people will derive that animal are not conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />In part, this is an effect of the organic nature of science. There are
<br />
at least 3 rejoinders to this:
<br />
<br />i) Who is to say cats cannot perform universal computation. UC is in
<br />
fact a very common property in the universe.
<br />
ii) Who is to say that cats are conscious (in the sense of the
<br />
anthropic principle - ie sufficiently aware to &quot;instantiate&quot; a
<br />
universe).
<br />
iii) Universal computation is not necessary in order to obtain a
<br />
reasonable prior - the equivalencing mechanism mentioned in &quot;On
<br />
Complexity and Emergence&quot;. Occam was originally written 18 months ago,
<br />
and revised in response to some criticism about 9 months ago. My own
<br />
understanding has moved on, but when a paper is under review for
<br />
publication, one shouldn't change any more than is necessary.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ii) needs a definition of time. You will see how time emerges in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach. It is linked to consciousness, and basicaly I would agree,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although the subject of experience is a person and not consciousness,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is a qualitative state of that person experiencing time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I don't think the time here is too mysterious. All one needs is a one
<br />
dimensional parameter t, so one can write down an evolution
<br />
equation. That this time is a subjective experience, rather than
<br />
inbuilt into the &quot;external physics&quot; is the controversial aspect of
<br />
this. However, this seems to be the only of answering the objections
<br />
of (eg Julian Barbour, etc).
<br />
<br />Besides, assumption i) Universal Compution, actually requires the
<br />
subjective experience of time in order for the computation to take
<br />
place. It's only upon relaxing this to the equivalencing mechansim,
<br />
that i) and ii) are independent postulates.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; iii) is a correct description of the appearances.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The reason I say this is that while homo sapiens is capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;universal computation, it is not its primary modus operandi, hence I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;would be surprised if the prior distribution of descriptions was given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;by a universal computer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see the relation with the prior distribution. I guess I miss 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something here.
</em><br />
<br />The prior distribution is that the probability of observing a
<br />
particular description of the universe depends exponentionally on the
<br />
complexity of that description. Here complexity is defined using the
<br />
equivalence mechanism as set out in &quot;Complexity and Emergence&quot;. In the
<br />
case where the equivalence class used is all descriptions
<br />
generating a particular output from a universal turing machine, then
<br />
the complexity measure is just the usual Kolmogorov complexity, and
<br />
the prior is just the usual Universal prior.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;One can criticse my work on 3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;grounds:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;i) My conclusions do not follow logically from this basis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;ii) That there are additional hidden assumptions needed, that I've not made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;clear or precise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;iii) That one or more of the above assumptions are false
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I'm am therefore, far more interested in errors of logic or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;omission. It would seem that you would develop a criticism along the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;lines of ii) - hidden assumptions, however I've yet to see these spelt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;out (or perhaps they have, just I haven't understood it because of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;language barriers).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact I'm not sure what exactly are your assumptions. Are you talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the assumptions about consciousness? 
</em><br />
<br />Yes, plus the Kolmogorov axioms of probability, plus a minimal amount
<br />
from set theory needed to support these. Also, of course, that we're
<br />
dealing with the set of all descriptions, which is basically the same
<br />
as your &quot;Arithmetical Platonism&quot;. And the Anthropic Principle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have still the feeling that you attach observers to universes.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You don't postulate comp, do you?
</em><br />
<br />No I don't. However, my theory is compatible with COMP.
<br />
<br />I still need to understand what you mean by &quot;attaching observers to
<br />
universes&quot;. Do you mean that the observed universe needs to be
<br />
consistent with the fact that we are around to observe it? If so, then
<br />
yes I do assume it, ie the Anthropic Principle.
<br />
<br />However, one way of justifying this is as follows - consider the
<br />
situation of us observing an extremely simple universe that cannot
<br />
support intelligent life. The observational fact of observing
<br />
ourselves observing would thus appear as a miracle, and the resulting
<br />
description has a very high complexity, leading to a vanishingly small
<br />
probability compared with the sort of universe that allows
<br />
intelligence to naturally develop.
<br />
<br />This is fine, but one may then ask the question - why do we need to
<br />
observe ourselves? Obviously we do - but why isn't just observation of
<br />
an external universe sufficient. On this matter, I shall stay silent -
<br />
this is an open problem, I believe. One that I raised before in this
<br />
group. It is also related to the question of whether cats can be
<br />
&quot;conscious&quot; in this self-aware sense. To date, only humans, chimps and
<br />
dolphins are known to be self-aware (at least according to a
<br />
television news item from the other night).
