<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This has no meaning for me. It is like saying &quot;don't ask&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Hmmmmm.  You don't at all see what I'm trying to say?
<br />
<br />Okay, how about this:  Reality is tautological.
<br />
<br />So if our conscious experience is caused by a rule-following system,
<br />
based on a sequence of determinisitc transforms applied to an initial
<br />
state...and this is true of both physicalism and your theory I
<br />
think...then our conscious experience just is what it is.  Tautology.
<br />
Everything that follows was implicit in the setup.
<br />
<br />And there's no obvious reason that the &quot;unpacked&quot; version, where what
<br />
follows is made *explicit*, shouldn't be considered as a whole - with
<br />
the beginning, middle, and end states seen as existing simultaneously
<br />
and timelessly.  This makes the view that &quot;it just is what it is&quot; even
<br />
more obvious.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, what do your theory say about accepting or not an artificial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain?
</em><br />
<br />IF consciousness is caused, then whether you accept or not is a
<br />
forgone conclusion, implicit in the initial setup (initial state +
<br />
transformation rules) of the system that caused your conscious
<br />
experience.  So there is no real choice to &quot;accept or decline&quot;.  Only
<br />
the conscious experience of a choice.
<br />
<br />If consciousness is UNCAUSED and fundamental, then...same answer.
<br />
There is no real choice to &quot;accept or decline&quot;.  Only the conscious
<br />
experience of a choice.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; More generally, how do you see the relation between brain and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscience?
</em><br />
<br />Brains only exist as something that we consciously perceive.
<br />
<br />I'm sure that my brain can be viewed as representing the contents of
<br />
my experience.  And I'm sure that a computer program could also be
<br />
written that would represent the contents of my conscious experience
<br />
and whose representational state would evolve as the program ran so
<br />
that it continued to match the contents of my experience over time.
<br />
But this would not mean that the program was conscious, or that my
<br />
brain is the source of my consciousness.
<br />
<br />The living brain and the executing computer program both just
<br />
represent the contents of my conscious experience, in the same way
<br />
that a map represents the actual terrain.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Uncaused things can't be explained.  They just are.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So what causes the complexity and structure of the things that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conscious of?  Nothing.  That's just the way my experience is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ? I can't accept this, because I am interested in the how and why of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity of things and happenings.
</em><br />
<br />So you can look for patterns in what you observe, and interesting ways
<br />
to represent what you have observed in the past.  But this is as far
<br />
as you can go I think.  For the reasons outlined above.  Your
<br />
observations just are what they are.  There's no real explanation for
<br />
them...only pseudo-explanations.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No explanation can be given for uncaused fundamental events or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what are your assumptions about those entities? You theory does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look like what the guardian G* tells to the &quot;enlightened machine&quot; G:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you will not prove your consistency. But the machine can prove that IF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; she is consistent, then G* is right about that. So, on one level, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand why you say so, and at another level I explain why you say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so.
</em><br />
<br />So I lean towards the idea that only our conscious experiences are
<br />
&quot;real&quot;.  Things obviously exist as contents of conscious experiences.
<br />
I don't have any assumptions about them.  They just are what they are,
<br />
because the conscious experience that &quot;contains&quot; them is what it is.
<br />
Tautology.
<br />
<br />I *think* I'm leaning towards saying that a lot of this stuff about
<br />
&quot;knowing&quot; is just a type of qualia.  But I'm not sure.  I'm still
<br />
thinking that part out.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;understanding&quot; is a complex notion. Theories are not build to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand, but to get a coherent (hopefully correct) picture.
</em><br />
<br />So I think it's reasonable to speak as though quarks and electrons are
<br />
real, if that helps the process of developing mathematical/narrative
<br />
models that fit our observations.  There are *useful fictions*, and
<br />
then there's what actually is.  Quarks and electrons are useful
<br />
fictions.  Conscious experience is what actually is.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think this is more obvious if you look at the system as a &quot;block
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe&quot;, where time is treated as a sort of spatial dimension, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; so all states of the system exist simultaneously, like my previous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; example of the block of granite.  Why does state B follow state A?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why is slice B adjacent to slice A?  Because that's just the way this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; uncaused system is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is big amorphous blob. Weird theory. I don't see the relation with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe, nor even with consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />So I'm saying that IF physicalism is true, then our universe is just
<br />
like that.  If physicalism is true then how else could it be?  And if
<br />
this physical universe is what causes our conscious experience, then
<br />
our conscious experience is just like that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Why would arithmetical relationships result in conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because arithmetical relationship described the theology and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science of self-observing machine. No machine can know as such its own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theology, but machine can get the theological science about simpler
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine, and then lift its logic on themselves (so they can remain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent in the process), and escape locally the incompleteness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not saying that truth is like that, but that if you say yes to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctor and survive the graft, then it has to be like that.
</em><br />
<br />So I can (sort of) see how a logical machine might symbolically
<br />
represent reality in this way.  BUT, this doesn't answer the question
<br />
of why there should be a conscious experience associated with the
<br />
machine symbolically representing reality this way.
<br />
<br />Does it?
<br />
<br /><pre>
--
To put it slightly differently, the machine might be in a state that
could be 3rd-person interpreted as the machine representing reality
this way.  BUT, this doesn't answer the question of why there should
be a conscious experience associated with the machine being in this
state.
Does it?
