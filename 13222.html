<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couple of hours for the first time I have managed to read this

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thread to here. Having done so, and in the spirit of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything-list wherein it is assumed everything is not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible but _will_ happen and indeed may already have happened
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a universe near you [and of course is that possibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists, then it definitely already always has happened], I get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the feeling that comp could lead to madness. But then, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course, it already has hasn't it ... in another universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere/when else ... of course ... :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thing is Brent and Stathis have been going around and around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this critical point of duration and continuity for some time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; now, without wanting to admit that *our experience of being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aware of being here and now [respectively] is intrinsically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradoxical*. Well I have felt compelled to that viewpoint for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more than a decade or so now, and I find from reading this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion that comp does not solve this. OK, it may well be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Loebian machines, whether modest or not in other universes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or just modest but smarter than me - the latter not hard :-) can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get on with the computation of their ontology and somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transcend the apparent paradox. The paradox I have thus far
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asserted to be primary is the comparatively simple thought that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are constantly mistaken in taking our experience to be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or less _all of what is happening_ when it is really only our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain's construction of its model of self in the world, which is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to sniff at of course but then the processes for doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this have been scores of millions of years in the making.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp makes the whole thing much more Comp-licated! AFAICS under
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Comp, we are each and every one of us confined to an anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view which does not even have a consolation that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participating in a genuine continuity. Pre-comp, one could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume that, no matter how deluded one might be, as long as 'I'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am able to be coherent long enough to recognise that it doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make sense to say 'I don't exist' then the chances were very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good that the world is going on independently of me and I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the chance of really contributing. In a pre-comp universe a wise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person will recognise that, well, things are always what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe them to be until we discover otherwise so we have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guarantee that our attempts to do the right thing are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily the best. However we have a right to believe that so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long as we have tried to sort out the facts of our situation and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purposed not to cause avoidable harm to others then we are being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as ethical as we know how to be and this counts for something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and at least we tried. But with comp, assuming there are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intrinsic barriers to the formation of worlds and experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wherein we can come to truly believe we and our world have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherent history, we have no reason to assume that this current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience _and the whole noumenal world we believe to exist_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot just wink out of existence. By definition it seems, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must always be possible that everything we take to be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indication of duration 'out there' is a transient artefact of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this slice of multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is a pretty rugged conception to present to people as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _necessarily_ possible. I therefore take comfort in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difficulties that people have in integrating Comp into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coherent explanation of the universe we perceive. I realise that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much can be done with higher mathematics but just because people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can create a formal language system in which algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes can be referred to with simple symbols, and sets of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such symbols can be syntaxed together with indicators that mean,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effectively, 'and so on so forth for ever and ever', this does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not mean that the universe outside of peoples' heads can ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflect this. I think it behoves contributors here to consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether the universal dovetailer can ever be more real than Jack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and his Beanstalk. Jack and his magic vegetable have been around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a couple of centuries now. The universal dovetailer may do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likewise. We just need to keep in touch with the idea though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that 'It Ain't Necessarily So!'.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Standard computationalism is just the theory that your brain could be
<br />
replaced with an appropriately configured digital computer and you would not
<br />
only act the same, you would also feel the same. Bruno goes on to show that
<br />
this entails there is no separate physical reality by means of the UDA, but
<br />
we can still talk about computationalism - the predominant theory in
<br />
cognitive science - without discussing the UDA. And in any case, the ideas
<br />
Brent and I have been discussing are still relevant if computationalism is
<br />
wrong and (again a separate matter) there is only one universe.
