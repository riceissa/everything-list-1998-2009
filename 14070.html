<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It may well be that Darwinism is some marriage of information theory

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with a multiverse idea, but it is not obvious how this works. I'd take

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it as a fairly fundamental building block at this stage.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm.... What could that mean? Darwinism by itself is a fuzzy theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with a lot of presuppositions. What does mean &quot;all the infinite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings&quot; + Darwinism?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me like (exagerating a bit for being clear) I presuppose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; string theory + the existence of the moon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Sure - the theories exist at different ontological levels. But a
<br />
fairly major point of my book is that it is essential to take this
<br />
into account, and is also fundamental to the 1-3 distinction.
<br />
<br />Not that I think that string theory + lunar existence will get you
<br />
anywhere, of course (but you never know!).
<br />
<br />Where evolutionary process come into the picture is generating
<br />
information. 
<br />
<br />In the Multiverse, all irreversible processes look like
<br />
evolution: branching of worlds gives variation, differing measure and
<br />
anthropic selection gives the selection part and determinism of the
<br />
Schroedinger equation gives heritability.
<br />
<br />What is more, even without considering the Multiverse, all creative
<br />
processes we know about (ones generating information) appear to be
<br />
evolutionary. So it is not too much of a stretch to conclude that all
<br />
creative processes must be evolutionary.
<br />
<br />Having established Occam's razor as a theorem in the Multiverse, there
<br />
is the immediate problem of the Occam catastrophe. This is resolved by
<br />
requiring a minimal complexity of the observed universe. The simplest
<br />
(and most probable by Occam) scheme for generating this complexity is
<br />
a creative process operating within a simple universe, and is far
<br />
simpler than an ab initio complex universe (a Boltzmann brain).
<br />
<br />So the assumption that all creative processes are evolutionary (which
<br />
one might hope will be better established than that in the future)
<br />
endows evolution with a pivotal role in these grand theories of
<br />
everything. Its particularly interesting that the evolutionary
<br />
concepts map directly to the fundamental postulates of QM. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Your problem may be in the lack of formal precision.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No. Conceptual precision. I still don't know what you postulate and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what you consider as derivable from the postulates.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Well obviously, I cannot at this stage explain more clearly than in
<br />
my book. However, feel free to ask questions, as in asking questions I
<br />
understand better your conceptual framework, and may well be able to
<br />
connect to it.
<br />
<br />As for results, I would list them as:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero information principle
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Occams razor
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Elimination of white rabbits (these are 1st person white rabbits - I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have no idea what a 3rd person white rabbit could be).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Necessity of self awareness for consciousness
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;3 out of 4 postulates of QM, namely:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Hilbert state space
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Schroedinger equation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Born rule
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; As is stated in &quot;Why Occams Razor&quot;, and made more explicit in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Importance of the Observer&quot; and &quot;Theory of Nothing&quot;, what is the U
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; used in computing the universal prior? It can be nothing other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the observer. U needn't even be a machine, any partition of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; strings into measurable subsets suffices.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Which part didn't you understand? The partition bit? If S is the set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of strings, with a measure mu such that mu(S)=1, then a function
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; f:S-&gt;N such that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     mu( f^{-1}(N) ) = 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; defines a partition { S_i = { x\in S| f(x)=i } | i \in N} of S.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And what if U is a machine? 
</em><br />
<br />It works if f is a machine, although not all machines satisfy the
<br />
above partitioning requirements, in particular non-halting machines.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What are the relations with the partitions. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is an observer (in the all infinite strings context)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Whatever else an observer is, it does map strings to interpretations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; And this identification turns an essentially 3rd person account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; into a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; 1st person account. To talk about ASSA or RSSA one has to introduce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; some notion of time, or at least successor states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Which we have without ay physical time notion, nor subjective time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; notion with comp. Successor states are definable by use of numbers and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; successor of numbers. This can be important given that everybody 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; agrees
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; on numbers (except ultrafinitist, but I know only one in Russia), but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; nobody agrees on what &quot;time&quot; could be (even the third person physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; one, or first person plural).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well I, for one, have not made the connection between the successor of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a number, and subjective time in COMP.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Me neither. The successor function is just what we need conceptually to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talk about the steps of the Universal Dovetailer. Subjective time is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much higher level concept related to the 3rd hypostasis (aka first 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person, knower).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />In the UDA, you do make use of time, in particular the seperation
<br />
between 1st person time (duration experienced by the conscious
<br />
observer) and 3rd person time (measured by the running of the UD). One
<br />
of the lessons I draw from this is the irrelevancy of 3rd person time,
<br />
which comes about in step 8 of the argument (in the SANE version) in
<br />
the move to a completely Platonic basis. Obviously, 1st person time
<br />
remains, and appears to be explicitly assumed ISTM.
<br />
<br />I understand S4Grz has Kripke frames, and so one would expect that
<br />
hypostasis to have a time-like structure. However, it is not clear to
<br />
me how this might relate to the subjective time of the UDA. But wait,
<br />
you say there is more on this in your Brussel's thesis...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Don't you see that the UD* is just the set of infinite strings?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see, and I don't think so. UD* is the infinite running of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; UD. Now, what is true is that the UD dovetails on all portion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generable infinite (even uncountable sets) so that all programs will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; executed relatively of all infinite strings, but also infinite trees, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; graph, etc. 
</em><br />
<br />A UD based on a Turing machine only works on strings. Did you have
<br />
some other machine in mind - Lisp perhaps?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And all this each time relatively to the execution of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs, and this only from the first person point of view. UD* as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen from a third person perspective never goes to the uncountable. 
</em><br />
<br />I don't see why not. It all depends on what you allow in Platonia.
<br />
I remember we had a lengthy discussion with Schmidhuber, who was
<br />
arguing as you are now.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eventually UD* endows all the non trivial constraints from computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science/mathematical logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I assume this relates cryptically to the previous in some way.
<br />
...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So now, you assume things like Church thesis. But then there are others 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements which makes no sense (if only like: only the strings).
</em><br />
<br />How is the CT incompatible with the set of all strings?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I understand many of your answer locally, but do not succeed in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relating them coherently, (and thus the problem of conceptual clarity) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; except by assuming comp, and correcting a few bit your intuition by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; using my own work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />It is a worthwhile exercise to do this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Are you really sure of this? What if it is a newborn child placed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inside the W-M duplication experiment, that repeats (100 times a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; second might be fast enough). Don't you think the child might end up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; distilling some sort of reality from what it observes? ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an ASSA type of reasoning, and I don't see how this could work 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (even without comp). 
</em><br />
<br />No - it is SSA based, not SSSA (ie reasoning on birth moments).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even a new born baby would experiment the quasi 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exact splitting in two of a flux of z-photons send on an x-analyser (to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take the quantum version of the WM iterated duplication).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the WM iteration, most of the mutiplied baby will be in front of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incompressible WM-strings independently of the fact that they can read 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it or not due to the contingent fact that babies cannot read).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ... Perhaps most don't, but only those that manage to build up some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; kind of coherent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality from the random sequences of W's and M's ever become conscious.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is a move like &quot;white rabbit does not exist because they make no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense&quot;. But both by UDA and AUDA, all the problems is that white rabbit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does makes sense. They does not entail inconsistency, and they can only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be avoided by a (absolute and/or relative) measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />No White Rabbits are not experienced because they're immensely complex
<br />
relative to what we normally observe. Small amounts of noise (relative
<br />
to the wabbity stuff) seen in the context of consistent world views are
<br />
simply filtered out. It has to be that way, as otherwise we'd be
<br />
hopelessly distracted by contingent data in the natural environment,
<br />
and effectively non-functional.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OK - but then you can never know that you know something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a subtle point. Formally you *can* know that you know something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Know p -&gt; Know Know p). But indeed, you cannot know *for sure* that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you know for sure something. 
</em><br />
<br />Umm - what's the difference?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is why comp prevents us to ever know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are awake or sound, or things like that, although we can know to be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong or dreaming, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The price of attaching knowledge to the (unameable, undefinable) truth, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that we loose the connection of knowledge with certainty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But this is like in &quot;real life&quot; where you can still have the memory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having believe knowing something, and then changing your mind. If not, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we would always say &quot;believe&quot; in place of &quot;know&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />To the intense frustration of my wife!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Confirmation is provided by the fact that that doing this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; gives an unameable (by itself) self quite similar to Brouwer's theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; of consciousness (which has given birth to intutionnist math and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; philo). Much much more can be said here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This I've never really understood. What is this unnameable self, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not a logic statement, or a system of logic statements?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will try to come back on this. It is explained in my SANE and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PLOTINUS paper (and the  theses (in french)).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Ah - in that paper you use &quot;to name&quot; to mean &quot;assert by a consistent
<br />
machine&quot;. This is not an everyday use of the verb, but maybe it makes
<br />
sense in the context of Plotinus theology, a subject I have little
<br />
interest in.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Where is the justification of this? I'm not trying to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; argumentative, but I missed seeing this justification in both your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Lille thesis and your SANE paper.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is what I explained in 300 pages in &quot;Conscience et Mécanisme&quot;, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has been replaced in the Lille thesis by &quot;see Godel, Lob, Solovay&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is pure computer science/mathematical logic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />It can't be pure logic, as it forms a bridge between the formal world
<br />
and the &quot;baggage&quot; by which we understand things. It should be in the
<br />
form of an intuition pump like the UDA, or some handwaving description like
<br />
much of ToN.
<br />
<br />But I do need to read the Brussels thesis one day. I was hoping you
<br />
might take me up on my offer to translate it - it would force me to
<br />
read it thoroughly!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Experiences are the roots of incorrigible knowledge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It seems one can be wrong about one's experiences.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How is this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; incorrigible knowledge then?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is incorrigible for the reason that it is attached to truth by 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition. 
</em><br />
<br />We're not apriori talking about the same thing. There is incorrigible
<br />
knowledge, defined by the formula Bp &amp; p. There are experiences, which
<br />
are what the observer experience - related to OMs, qualia and all that
<br />
stuff. Where's the connection?
