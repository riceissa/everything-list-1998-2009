Sorry to be so slow at responding here but life [domestic], the universe 
<br />
and everything else right now is competing savagely with this 
<br />
interesting discussion. [But one must always think positive; 'Bah, 
<br />
Humbug!' is not appropriate, even though the temptation is great some 
<br />
times :-]
<br />
<br />Stathis,
<br />
I am not entirely convinced when you say: 'And the psychopath is right: 
<br />
no-one can actually fault him on a point of fact or a point of logic'
<br />
That would only be right if we allowed that his [psychopathy is mostly a 
<br />
male affliction I believe] use of words is easily as reasonable as yours 
<br />
or mine. However, where the said psycho. is purporting to make 
<br />
authoritative statements about the world, it is not OK for him to 
<br />
purport that what he describes is unquestionably factual and his 
<br />
reasoning from the facts as he sees them is necessarily authoritative 
<br />
for anyone else. This is because, qua psychopath, he is not able to make 
<br />
the fullest possible free decisions about what makes people tick or even 
<br />
about what is reality for the rest of us. He is, in a sense, mortally 
<br />
wounded, and forever impaired; condemned always to make only 'logical' 
<br />
decisions. :-)
<br />
<br />The way I see it, roughly and readily, is that there are in fact certain 
<br />
statements/descriptions about the world and our place in it which are 
<br />
MUCH MORE REASONABLE than a whole lot of others. I think therefore that, 
<br />
even though you might be right from a 'purely logical' point of view 
<br />
when you say the following: 'In the *final* analysis, ethical beliefs 
<br />
are not a matter of fact or logic, and if it seems that they are then 
<br />
there is a hidden assumption somewhere'
<br />
in fact, from the point of view of practical living and the necessities 
<br />
of survival, the correct approach is to assert what amounts to a set of 
<br />
practical axioms, including:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the mere fact of existence is the basis of value, that good and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bad are expressed differently within - and between - different
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cultures and their sub-cultures but ultimately there is an
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;objective, absolute basis for the concept of 'goodness', because
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in all normal circumstances it is better to exist than not to exist,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* related to this and arising out of it is the realisation that all
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;normal, healthy humans understand what is meant by both 'harm' and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'suffering', certainly those who have reached adulthood,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* furthermore, insofar as it is clearly recognisable that continuing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to exist as a human being requires access to and consumption of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all manner of natural resources and human-made goods and services,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is in our interests to nurture and further the inclinations in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourselves and others to behave in ways supportive of cooperation
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for mutual and general benefit wherever this is reasonably
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible, and certainly not to act destructively or disruptively
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless it is clear that doing so will prevent a much greater harm
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from occurring.
<br />
<br />It ought to be clear to all reasonable persons not engaged in self 
<br />
deception that in this modern era each and everyone of us is dependent - 
<br />
always - on at least a thousand other people doing the right thing, or 
<br />
trying to anyway. Thus the idea of 'manly', rugged, individualism is a 
<br />
romantic nonsense unless it also incorporates a recognition of mutual 
<br />
interdependence and the need for real fairness in social dealings at 
<br />
every level. Unless compassion, democracy and ethics are recognised 
<br />
[along with scientific method] as fundamental prerequisites for OUR 
<br />
survival, policies and practices will pretty much inevitably become 
<br />
self-defeating and destructive, no matter how well-intentioned to start 
<br />
with.
<br />
<br />In the interest of brevity I add the following quasi-axioms.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the advent of scientific method on Earth between 400 and 500 years
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ago has irreversibly transformed the human species so that now we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can reasonably assert that the human universe is always
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;potentially infinite, so long as it exists and we believe it to be so
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* to be fully human requires taking responsibility for one's actions
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this means consciously choosing to do things or accepting that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one has made a choice even if one cannot remember consciously choosing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* nobody knows the future, so all statements about the future are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either guesswork or statements of desires. Furthermore our lack of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge of times to come is very deep, such that we have no
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truly reasonable basis for dismissing the right to survive of any
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persons on the planet - or other living species for that matter -
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless it can be clearly shown that such killing or allowing to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;die, is necessary to prevent some far greater harm and the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assertion of this is of course hampered precisely by our lack of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge of the future
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />This feels incomplete but it needs to be sent.
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explain &gt;&gt; why &gt; good and bad feel as they do, or why we *should* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; care about good &gt;&gt; and &gt; bad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That's asking why we should care about what we should care about, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; i.e. &gt;&gt; good and bad.  Good feels as it does because it is (or was) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; evolutionarily advantageous to do that, e.g. have sex.  Bad feels 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as &gt;&gt; it does because it is (or was) evolutionarily advantageous to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not do &gt;&gt; that, e.g. hold your hand in the fire.  If it felt good 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you'd do it, &gt;&gt; because that's what &quot;feels good&quot; means, a feeling you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; want to have.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But it is not an absurd question to ask whether something we have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; evolved to think is good really is good. You are focussing on the &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; descriptive aspect of ethics and ignoring the normative.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Right - because I don't think there is an normative aspect in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; objective sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;Even if it &gt; could be shown that a certain ethical belief has been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hardwired into our &gt; brains this does not make the qustion of whether 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the belief is one we &gt; ought to have an absurd one. We could decide 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that evolution sucks and we &gt; have to deliberately flout it in every 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; way we can.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But we could only decide that by showing a conflict with something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; else we consider good.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;It might not be a &gt; wise policy but it is not *wrong* in the way it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would be wrong to claim &gt; that God made the world 6000 years ago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree, because I think there is a objective sense in which the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world is more than 6000yrs old.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;beyond following some imperative of evolution. For example, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Nazis &gt;&gt; &gt; argued that eliminating inferior specimens from the gene 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pool would &gt;&gt; ultimately &gt; produce a superior species. Aside from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; their irrational &gt;&gt; inclusion of certain &gt; groups as inferior, they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; were right: we could &gt;&gt; breed superior humans following &gt; Nazi 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; eugenic programs, and perhaps &gt;&gt; on other worlds evolution has made 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; such &gt; programs a natural part of &gt;&gt; life, regarded by everyone as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;good&quot;. Yet most of &gt; us would regard &gt;&gt; them as bad, regardless of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; their practical benefits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Would we?  Before the Nazis gave it a bad name, eugenics was a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; popular &gt;&gt; movement in the U.S. mostly directed at sterilizing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mentally retarded &gt;&gt; people.  I think it would be regarded as bad 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simply because we don't &gt;&gt; trust government power to be exercised 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; prudently or to be easily &gt;&gt; limited  - both practical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; considerations.  If eugenics is practiced &gt;&gt; voluntarily, as it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; being practiced in the U.S., I don't think &gt;&gt; anyone will object 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (well a few fundamentalist luddites will).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What about if we tested every child and allowed only the superior 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ones &gt; to reproduce? The point is, many people would just say this is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; wrong, &gt; regardless of the potential benefits to society or the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; species, and the &gt; response to this is not that it is absurd to hold 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it as wrong (leaving &gt; aside emotional rhetoric).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But people wouldn't *just* say this is wrong. This example is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; question of societal policy. It's about what *we* will impose on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *them*.  It is a question of ethics, not good and bad.  So in fact 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; people would give reasons it was wrong: Who's gonna say what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;superior&quot; means?  Who gets to decide?   They might say, &quot;I just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; think it's bad.&quot; - but that would just be an implicit appeal to you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to see whether you thought is was bad too.  Social policy can only be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; judged in terms of what the individual members of society think is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; good or bad.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think I'm losing the thread of what we're discussing here.  Are you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; holding that there are absolute norms of good/bad - as in your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; example of eugenics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps none of the participants in this thread really disagree. Let 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me see if I can summarise:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Individuals and societies have arrived at ethical beliefs for a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason, whether that be evolution, what their parents taught them, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what it says in a book believed to be divinely inspired. Perhaps all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of these reasons can be subsumed under &quot;evolution&quot; if that term can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extended beyond genetics to include all the ideas, beliefs, customs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc. that help a society to survive and propagate itself. Now, we can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take this and formalise it in some way so that we can discuss ethical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; questions rationally:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Murder is bad because it reduces the net happiness in society - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Utilitarianism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Murder is bed because it breaks the sixth commandment - Judaism and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christianity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (interesting that this only no. 6 on a list of 10: God knows his 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; priorities)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ethics then becomes objective, given the rules. The meta-ethical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation of evolution, broadly understood, as generating the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various ethical systems is also objective. However, it is possible for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone at the bottom of the heap to go over the head of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; utilitarianism, evolution, even God and say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Why should murder be bad? I don't care about the greatest good for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the greatest number, I don't care if the species dies out, and I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God is a bastard and will shout it from hell if sends me there for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; killing people for fun and profit. This is my own personal ethical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief, and you can't tell me I'm wrong!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And the psychopath is right: no-one can actually fault him on a point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of fact or a point of logic. In the *final* analysis, ethical beliefs 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not a matter of fact or logic, and if it seems that they are then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a hidden assumption somewhere.
