<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alternative physical laws), but I don't think this is something you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;derive by deduction or thought experiments.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I begin by question two. The word &quot;comp&quot; abbreviates &quot;computationalism&quot;.
<br />
It means the conjonction of three hypothesis:
<br />
<br />1) It exists a level of description of &quot;myself&quot; such that I remain
<br />
invariant through a functionnal substitution of part of &quot;myself&quot; by
<br />
digital devices, where the substitution is done at that level of course.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This hypothesis is a modern version of Descartes Mechanism. A short
<br />
way to enunciate it is &quot;I am a machine&quot;, except that &quot;myself&quot; here is
<br />
anything which needs to be taken into account for my &quot;surviving&quot; through
<br />
the substitution. I don't pretend we know or we can know what is our
<br />
level of substitution. The thought experiment are more easy if we suppose
<br />
the level high, i.e. the level of brain neurons for exemple. At the end
<br />
of UDA I explain how to eliminate that &quot;highness of level&quot; supplementary
<br />
hypothesis. (UDA = Universal Dovetailer Argument).
<br />
A quasi operational view of that hypothesis is to say that a
<br />
computationalist practionner is someone saying &quot;yes&quot; to its brain
<br />
surgeon when he proposed an artificial digital brain (or body, universe,
<br />
etc.). Comp entails also the possible use of classical teletransporters.
<br />
I use here a minimum amount of &quot;folk psychology&quot; for the understanding
<br />
of &quot;I remain invariant&quot; or &quot;I feel nothing&quot;. It is the same amount
<br />
which is need to understand that someone is anxious before going
<br />
to the hospital for an important operation. It is used in the UDA, but
<br />
&quot;folk psychology&quot; is replaced by the &quot;provability logics&quot; in the
<br />
Arithmetical translation of the UDA. What I call now AUDA to make
<br />
things more clear.
<br />
<br />The two other hypotheses are needed only for making the reasoning
<br />
more precise:
<br />
<br />2) Church Thesis:  Anything computable is Turing computable. I give
<br />
the conceptual reason for this at
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3344.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3344.html</a>
<br />
I guess you know the empirical result: all attempts to define
<br />
the set of computable functions leads to the same set (from Babbage
<br />
to Deutsch!).
<br />
<br />3) Arithmetical Realism:  The truth of an arithmetical proposition
<br />
(like &quot;24 is not a prime number&quot; is independent of me, you, humanity, 
<br />
etc.). In particular this entails that proposition like &quot;the machine
<br />
with godel number n does not stop on the input 24&quot; is absolutely
<br />
true or false. It means also that our background logic is classical.
<br />
It is my ontological commitment: numbers (at least) and their
<br />
definissable (in Fortran, or Turing ...) relations exists.
<br />
<br /><br />I use &quot;comp&quot; in the sense of 1)+2)+3). It is different from
<br />
Schmidhuber's comp where a universe is supposed to exist and to be
<br />
computable. I suppose only that &quot;I&quot; am computable whatever I
<br />
thing what &quot;I&quot; could be.
<br />
<br />More on this in my first presentation of UDA in the list:
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m1726.html</a>
<br />
(But the UDA is more simply done step by step at
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>).
<br />
<br /><br />I recall your question 1:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. Please define &quot;computational extension&quot;. What is an extension? What is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it an extension of? What does it mean for an extension to be consistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(consistent with what, in what way)?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I give you first exemples. The basic one is given by the WM
<br />
duplication thought experiment. In that experiment I am &quot;cut&quot; in
<br />
Brussels and pasted at both Washington and Moscow. The state of 
<br />
my mind at Washington, with the belief &quot;oh! it looks like Washington&quot;
<br />
is a  computational extension of my computational state in Brussels.
<br />
<br />So, roughly speaking, computational extensions of my current
<br />
computational history are given by the accessible computational
<br />
states. (Extended with some &quot;logical rules&quot; so I can use local
<br />
reasoning by the computationalist practionners)
<br />
<br />With comp, at Brussels I cannot prove that I will be at Washington
<br />
so it is possible that I will not be at Washington (here it means
<br />
I will be at Moscow). More generaly if I cannot prove p, it means
<br />
-p is consistent for me.
<br />
That is: if I cannot prove p, it means there is a consistent
<br />
extension of me such that p is true in that extension.
<br />
In such a talk I identify a &quot;world&quot; with some maximal extension.
<br />
<br />In UDA you need only the simple definition: accessible computational
<br />
continuation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. In section 4, you use several results from what you call &quot;the Godelian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;study of provability&quot;. What is this field formally known as? Is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metamathematics? Are there any good textbooks on this subject?
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is metamathematics.
<br />
<br />The best book is Boolos 1993 &quot;The logic of provability&quot; (ref in my 
<br />
thesis, or look at &quot;Boolos&quot; in the archive). 
<br />
A good intro is Boolos and Jeffrey.
<br />
A textbook is Smorynski &quot;Self-reference and Modal logic&quot;.
<br />
A popular introduction is Smullyan's &quot;Forever Undecided&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Moreover, if quantum mechanics is the correct description of reality, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; must derived it from computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why must we? I think it would be nice if we could, but we probably won't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be able to. In order to do it we would need to show that quantum mechanics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is the shortest algorithm for generating observers-moments. We may be able
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to obtain some evidence on this (for example by running simulations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alternative physical laws), but I don't think this is something you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;derive by deduction or thought experiments.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I know. That is why I would appreciate people show me wrong, because
<br />
my point is a proof that IF comp is true THEN the physical laws are
<br />
derivable from the logic of provability (what I like to call Machine
<br />
Psychology). UDA is the proof. 
<br />
Physics is given by some universal average on the machine consistent
<br />
extensions as viewed by themselve (cf the 1-person/3-person distinguo). 
<br />
It is a (admittedly counter-intuitive) consequence of comp by the UDA.
<br />
The AUDA shows that the &quot;probability 1&quot; on those consistent extensions
<br />
(defined in the language of a sound universal machine) has some
<br />
quantum logic feature, which confirms comp (through UDA).
<br />
<br />Also, when you say that QM should be the shortest algorithm, I am
<br />
afraid you share with Schmidhuber a proposition on the mind body
<br />
relationship which I show to be inconsistent with comp. You seem
<br />
to believe that the mind brain relation is one-one. That is why
<br />
I try to challenge you on this point. UDA is really a question. It
<br />
shows that although with comp we can associate a mind to a computing
<br />
machine, we cannot associate a computing machine to a mind but some
<br />
sort of infinity of them. Mind-body is one-many relation. 
<br />
<br />Hoping I'm not too quick or too long. Don't hesitate to ask me to
<br />
be more clear where you feel I am not. I never pretend my work
<br />
being simple. (My problem is that a lot of people find some
<br />
part difficult but it is rarely the same part).
<br />
