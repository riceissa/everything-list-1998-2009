</em><br />
<br />Can you explain more why you think this one-to-one relationship implies it's 
<br />
incorrect to apply the self-sampling assumption to observer-moments? As I 
<br />
said in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread (at 
<br />
<a href="http://tinyurl.com/5265d">http://tinyurl.com/5265d</a> ), I am inclined to believe a final theory of 
<br />
everything would allow us to use both the ASSA (the theory would assign each 
<br />
observer-moment an absolute probability, and we could reason as if our 
<br />
current OM was randomly selected from the set of all possible OMs, weighted 
<br />
by their absolute probability) and the RSSA (for each OM, the theory would 
<br />
give a conditional probability that the observer's subsequent experience 
<br />
would be any other possible OM). If you're suggesting the two are 
<br />
incompatible, there's no need for them to be. Consider the following 
<br />
analogy--we have a bunch of tanks of water, and each tank is constantly 
<br />
pumping a certain amount of its own water to a bunch of other tanks, and 
<br />
having water pumped into it from other tanks. The ratio between the rates 
<br />
that a given tank is pumping water into two other tanks corresponds to the 
<br />
ratio between the probabilities that a given observer-moment will be 
<br />
succeeded by one of two other possible OMs--if you imagine individual water 
<br />
molecules as observers, then the ratio between rates water is going to the 
<br />
two tanks will be the same as the ratio between the probabilities that a 
<br />
given molecule in the current tank will subsequently find itself in one of 
<br />
those two tanks. Meanwhile, the total amount of water in a tank would 
<br />
correspond to the absolute probability of a given OM--at any given time, if 
<br />
you randomly select a single water molecule from the collection of all 
<br />
molecules in all tanks, the amount of water in a tank is proportional to the 
<br />
probability your randomly-selected molecule will be in that tank.
<br />
<br />Now, for most ways of arranging this system, the total amount of water in 
<br />
different tanks will be changing over time. In terms of the analogy, this 
<br />
would be like imposing some sort of universal time-coordinate on the whole 
<br />
multiverse and saying the absolute probability of finding yourself 
<br />
experiencing a given OM changes with time, which seems pretty implausible to 
<br />
me. But if the system is balanced in such a way that, for each tank, the 
<br />
total rate that water is being pumped out is equal to the total rate that 
<br />
water is being pumped in, then the system as a whole will be in a kind of 
<br />
equilibrium, with no variation in the amount of water in any tank over time. 
<br />
So in terms of OMs, this suggests a constraint on the relationship between 
<br />
the absolute probabilities and the conditional probabilities, and this 
<br />
constraint (together with some constraints imposed by a 'theory of 
<br />
consciousness' of some kind) might actually help us find a unique 
<br />
self-consistent way to assign both sets of probabilities, an idea I 
<br />
elaborated on in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread.
<br />
<br />In terms of the QTI, accepting both the ASSA and RSSA seems to imply there 
<br />
would be no point at which our stream of consciousness would end, but the 
<br />
ASSA also implies that it's unlikely a typical observer-moment has memories 
<br />
of being extremely old, so it seems we'd have to accept some sort of 
<br />
&quot;immortality with amnesia&quot;--maybe as I approach death, my stream of 
<br />
consciousness will move into simpler and simpler OMs, and then eventually 
<br />
start climbing back up the ladder of complexity into the OMs of a different 
<br />
person who has no memory of my life. Or maybe the advanced transhuman 
<br />
intelligences of the future periodically like to wipe most of their memories 
<br />
and experience what it was like to be a human-level intelligence, so that at 
<br />
the end of my life my memories will be reintigrated with those of this 
<br />
larger intelligence (maybe this replaying of a life would be a necessary 
<br />
part of the merging of two distinct transhuman minds, something which 
<br />
transhuman intelligences would probably want to do if at all possible). 
<br />
There are probably other creative ways to have immortality (as implied by 
<br />
the RSSA) be compatible with the idea that my current OM is a &quot;typical&quot; one 
<br />
(as implied by the ASSA), too.
<br />
<br />Jesse
