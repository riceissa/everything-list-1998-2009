&nbsp;Hi Bruno
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your detailed answer. I will wipe some of the previous 
<br />
exchanges below to unclutter the post:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;-----Original Message-----
<br />
&nbsp;From: Bruno Marchal &lt;marchal.domain.name.hidden&gt;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think there is a clear-cut frontier between Science and 
<br />
Philosophy, except those artificial frontiers introduced by academic 
<br />
for &quot;financial purposes&quot; (to be short).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually I don't believe there are scientific field and non scientific 
<br />
field. I believe in scientific attitudes, which is a mixture of modesty 
<br />
and willingness to share questions with other.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scientists who pretends not doing philosophy are just taking some 
<br />
philosophy for granted, like the naturalist assumptions of Aristotle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And in ALL fields, passion and emotion *can* mislead our scientific 
<br />
attitude. This is human, and even *machine*.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Could not agree with you more...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Well, astists will probably argue that they are quite concerned with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality in their own way. You don't want to confuse your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; subjective impressions (qualia) with the fact that you have them or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; report them. The later are the subject of scientific inquiry while 
</em><br />
the &gt; former may not qualify. Scientific Reality is definitely more 
<br />
specific &gt; than reality in general.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;But scientific &quot;reality&quot; is not bounded. The shape of earth was a 
<br />
matter of philosophy and theology at some time. My personal qualia and 
<br />
first person views cannot be used in a scientific paper, of course. But 
<br />
qualia and first person view can be addressed in third person way. For 
<br />
this we build theories, which are just hypothetical world view 
<br />
constructions.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I fully agree, though I am sure you are aware that &quot;mentality&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;identity&quot; are among the most difficult problems that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;science has tried to tackle and that what we think we know about such 
<br />
matters pales in comparison with what we are sure we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;don't know! Even just building theories may be more forthcoming in 
<br />
some domains than others, irrespective of testing them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; There is also much that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; one can acknowledge without admitting to its reality. I have heard 
</em><br />
of, &gt; say, alien abductions but would not swear to their reality,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; though others may differ.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just ignorance. Science is *the* most efficacious way to 
<br />
accept that we are ignorant.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the motor of science. If you have a scientific interest in alien 
<br />
abduction you can always search for a piece of unknown metal, or for 
<br />
tackling the plausibility problem of the account. Etc. As I mentioned 
<br />
before one of my favorite text to illustrate what is the scientific 
<br />
attitude is given in a book of parapsychology (the &quot;In search of the 
<br />
light' by S. Blackmore). Of course the whishfull thinkers in 
<br />
parapsychology doesn't like it because it is negative (She shows the 
<br />
protocol errors in most parapsychologists experiments).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a wonderful point you make above! But my own was that 
<br />
acknowledging something may not exactly be the same as admiting its 
<br />
reality; it can in fact be just the oposite when what is acknowledge is 
<br />
someone else's belief for instance. How
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(consensual) reality is acquired is a pretty complicated and still 
<br />
mysterious process. I would venture that a lot of what we
<br />
&nbsp;would count as &quot;subjective reality&quot; is just that! (more below)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; I would argue that numbers are rather objective, perhaps even more &gt; 
</em><br />
than physical laws and surely so if you are right, no?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I find personally that the fact that 17 is prime is less doubtful 
<br />
than any third person materialist ontological commitment. But I am 
<br />
perhaps wrong and I don't really care. As a logician I am mainly 
<br />
interested in the consistency of sets of beliefs, and validity of 
<br />
arguments. My point is that materialism and digital mechanism (comp) 
<br />
are just incompatible.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;In this we agree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; If that derivation is just a piece of your subjectivity that may 
</em><br />
dash &gt; your hopes to convey it to others...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;By derivation I really mean &quot;demonstration&quot;. It is valid for anyone 
<br />
(accepting classical logic applies on the elementary arithmetical 
<br />
truth). Sorry if this looks contemptuous.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It may very well be contemptuous but I cannot fault your 
<br />
&quot;demonstration&quot; since I see no reason why materialism would
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;be compatible with your hypothesis! If I understand it correctly this 
<br />
is that one materially supported conscious entity could
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;be entirely (and analytically) replaced by a digitally constructed one 
<br />
without it even being conscious of it. Am I right? Is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;this what you COMP ? If so you are right in one thing: it is one hell 
<br />
of a stronger contention than the strongest AI hyp
<br />
&nbsp;(and that much more unlikely).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Oh, it seems you agree than! &quot;The Work&quot; goes well with your &gt; 
</em><br />
theological inclinations, seems to me though I am as hopeless
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; about understanding it as Lee is...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;OK. This means you are serious like Lee. I certainly don't expect 
<br />
people to understand it quickly! The people in this list does not know 
<br />
(I think) that they are one century in advance!
<br />
&nbsp;(and then they doesn't know I'm two centuries in advance ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(Don't infer I'm some sort of genius: it is just years and years and 
<br />
years of work + open mindedness).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh don't worry about that! There is genius in knowing that your are 
<br />
not! And since you are a machine your years and years
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and years may surely add to two centuries! No wonder you outrun your 
<br />
modesty...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the matter subject is not so easy. It crosses many hard 
<br />
fields, and leads to many hard to swallow conclusions. Bohr said that 
<br />
if you understand quantum mechanics, it means you are missing 
<br />
something. The comp hyp is like that. The more you understand the more 
<br />
you realize truth is beyond fiction. Now, feel free to read my 
<br />
argumentation and ask question if you are interested.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My point (and I want to be short but some people in the list get 
<br />
similar points, even if when we discuss it between us we insist on the 
<br />
differences of course), so my point is just that if we make the comp 
<br />
hypothesis in the cognitive science (including some amount of 
<br />
mathematical platonism, and Church thesis), then, literally, physics 
<br />
*is* a branch of computer science. And so the comp hyp is testable: 
<br />
derive physics from computer science and compare it to empirical 
<br />
physics. I have done a piece of that, and currently comp passed already 
<br />
non trivial tests.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh but you make it sound so easy! See: its is the &quot;derive physics from 
<br />
computer science&quot; that I have my first problem with!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Easier said than done, I'm afraid. Stephen Wolfram sent me his huge 
<br />
book but I remain as unconvinced by it as everyone
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;else who has read it about his &quot;tinker bell&quot; version of Quantum 
<br />
Mechanics. I heard Ed Fredkin a number of times and,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;though he is quite charming, I don't think he has any better answer to 
<br />
that question...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically: I believe QM puts a big kabosh into any non-quantum 
<br />
mechanistic view of the physical world. If you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;don't get that, than maybe you don't get a lot of other things, Bruno. 
<br />
Sorry if this sounds contemptuous. It is meant
<br />
&nbsp;to be.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, the reverse reduction of computer science to physics 
<br />
seems to be a lot more hopeful specially since most
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;computations seem to run a lot faster in physical computers than on... 
<br />
(what are the alternatives again?). OK, no one
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;has built a truly quantum computer just yet but a lot of people think 
<br />
they are about to do it!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">  &gt; Explaining what elation or sadness correspond to in terms of neural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes does not help me find
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">  &gt; out why I am elated today and sad tomorrow. Usually those experience 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are much easier to explain and in objective terms.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure I understand. I think no &quot;experiences&quot; can be easily 
<br />
explained in 3-person terms.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;remember that if comp and my derivation is correct, eventually the 
<br />
very brain itself emerges from first person experiences (and here I 
<br />
agree with George Levy).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, (and here George Levy disagrees), first person experiences 
<br />
emerges from third person sharable relation between numbers. Please, 
<br />
take this with some grain of salt until you have your personal evidence 
<br />
for a plausible explanation of what I am saying here.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure will (take it with and entire salt mine)! My point is that we 
<br />
already have ways of explaining other people's experiences
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;on the basis of empathy or antipathy and in terms of direct causation. 
<br />
Bill Clinton was found of saying &quot;I feel your pain&quot; and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;no one called him on that obvious lie! I can think of some numbers 
<br />
that would tell me about the pain others are feeling
<br />
&nbsp;(checked the price of gas today? $2.59 a gallon!!! That hurts!!!)
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;....
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;All what I say is that if me, you or X says &quot;yes&quot; to the mechanist 
<br />
doctor, then &quot;the universal religion of machine&quot; are given by a 
<br />
mathematical theory which is testable because, as a religious theology, 
<br />
it provided a 100% precise cosmogony. If from comp you deduce that 
<br />
electron have no weight, then comp is refuted. That could be 
<br />
problematical in case you have already say &quot;yes&quot; to the doctor!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ooops! Sure would be problematic, wouldn't it? I better think a bit 
<br />
about that &quot;yes&quot; again.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously, I see nothing wrong with what you saying as long as you 
<br />
couch it in that &quot;faith-based&quot; argumentation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your argument is cute and may very well be defensible that way. This 
<br />
day and and age it may actually be better supported
<br />
&nbsp;that way than as hard clad science, who knows?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; [GK]
</em><br />
&nbsp;...
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Best wishes with ... &quot;the Work&quot;,
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Many thanks. &quot;the works&quot;, as you say, is divided into two parts. An 
<br />
informal, but (hopefully) rigorous and complete, argument showing that 
<br />
physics is derivable from comp. That argument is not constructive. Its 
<br />
easyness comes from the fact that it does not really explained how to 
<br />
make the derivation.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, what a pity! I was kind of bracing to see that derivation! I am 
<br />
sure it would drive your point across a lot quicker.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh well, I could probably give you a couple of other outrageous 
<br />
hypothesis from which you could derive the whole
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of physics, not constructively of course! You are the logician but 
<br />
isn't it the case that from an assuredly false premise
<br />
&nbsp;you can derive anything?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[BM]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part is a translation of that argument in the language of 
<br />
the &quot;universal machine itself&quot;. This, by the constraints of theoretical 
<br />
computer science, makes the proof constructive, so that it gives the 
<br />
complete derivation of physics from computer science. Of course God is 
<br />
a little malicious, apparently, and we are led to hard intractable 
<br />
purely mathematical questions.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;You are welcome,

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh gosh! Another let down! Well maybe those pesky Quantum Computer 
<br />
builders can rescue you after all one day. As
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard that you plan to become immortal (after a little digital 
<br />
plastic surgery) you will have the time to wait for it!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno: you seem to hold quite estimable principles about the 
<br />
fundamentals of scientific practice and you seem much less
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;threatening than your digitalist surgeon. When I have a chance I'll 
<br />
check your papers out and see what I can make out
<br />
&nbsp;of them. Thanks for the summary, though.
