<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; watch fire-breathing dragons materialise out of nothing. So what? Those

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one-in-a-zillion version manifestly is, and will continue to live life

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This works OK to reject worlds where you die, but presumably there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;also more worlds where you survive but see surprising failures of natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;law than worlds where natural law exists.  If you truly believe this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it should affect your actions, and you should not proceed under the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumption that everything will be normal.  Most universes where you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;survive would probably be so lawless that you would just barely survive,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so perhaps this would point to abandoning moral behavior and striving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for brute survival at all costs.  I.e. go out and steal from people,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rob banks, commit murder without thought of the consequences, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it's far more likely that the street will turn to molten metal than that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you'll be apprehended and sent to jail.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually, no, I don't think most people (with past experience of an orderly 
<br />
world, as we have) WOULD behave in this way, even if it were proved beyond 
<br />
reasonable doubt that the lawless, disorganised universes always have and 
<br />
always will predominate. Having thought about this, I doubt that I would 
<br />
change my life much if this proof were provided, even if I didn't have to 
<br />
rely on death removing me from unspeakably horrible futures.  I think the 
<br />
important bit psychologically is the understanding that the horrible and 
<br />
disorganised universes which will predominate in the future have also 
<br />
predominated in the past - which would of course mean that we have been 
<br />
incredibly lucky to have survived thus far. It shouldn't make any difference 
<br />
to what we should expect from here on, logically, but psychologically, I 
<br />
think it would.
<br />
<br />Suppose you are credibly informed by some very wicked and very powerful 
<br />
aliens that, starting tonight, you will be whisked from your bed, cloned a 
<br />
thousand times, one clone will be returned to bed unharmed, while the rest 
<br />
will be tortured horribly for the rest of their lives. This will then be 
<br />
repeated with the clone that goes unharmed the next night, and so on every 
<br />
night until that clone dies before the next cloning time is due. Given this 
<br />
bleak future, many people, perhaps most people, would understandably choose 
<br />
suicide now as the only way out.
<br />
<br />Now consider the same aliens credibly inform you of all the above, but with 
<br />
the additional information that, without your knowledge, the cloning/torture 
<br />
cycles have actually been going on since you were born. While the news would 
<br />
no doubt still be shocking, I suspect many people would say, &quot;So what? I've 
<br />
lived like this for years, and as far as this thread of consciousness which 
<br />
I identify as myself is concerned, I've done OK. As long as I can be sure 
<br />
that at least one thread of consciousness will continue as before, I would 
<br />
be stupid to kill myself now.&quot;
<br />
<br />You might say the attitude  in the last paragraph is irrational, but I would 
<br />
be surprised if at least a substantial minority of subscribers to this list 
<br />
(who, I think it would be fair to say, as a group hold reason in higher 
<br />
esteem than the population as a whole does) would decide against suicide.
<br />
<br />Probably it would make a difference if we could witness the clones' torture 
<br />
rather than just knowing that it occcurs, but returning to the original 
<br />
question, what better way is there to isolate ourselves from unpleasantness 
<br />
than sequestering it, forever unreachable even in theory, in a parallel 
<br />
universe?
