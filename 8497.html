</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree that &quot;all that exists is an ensemble of isolated observer moments&quot; 
<br />
is a good way to look at it. In fact, that is why I think the best 
<br />
&quot;objective&quot; answer is (c) rather than (b): each OM exists only transiently. 
<br />
However, as a human, what I am interested in is the experience (one could 
<br />
say, the illusion) of living my life a step at a time which results from the 
<br />
existence of certain special OMs in the great and mixed up ensemble of all 
<br />
possible OMs. Now, where I disagree with you is in the method and meaning of 
<br />
sampling from this ensemble. It is literally true, in a sense, that my &quot;next 
<br />
experience&quot; is more likely to be an OM of relatively high measure: a moment 
<br />
from my life in any month other than November 2005; the experiences of a 
<br />
Chinese rather than an Australian; death, the content-poor OM of inanimate 
<br />
matter. If a third person were randomly pulling OMs from the plenitude and 
<br />
setting them down in order, that is indeed what he would get. Amazingly, 
<br />
however, when *I* am doing the sampling, my &quot;next experience&quot; always turns 
<br />
out to be... well, something that we all recognise as a next experience. I 
<br />
always seem to find that rare OM amongst all the other other ones where I 
<br />
turn into a turnip, or I'm suddenly 95 years old, or all the other countless 
<br />
possibilities. I don't even have to go looking for it: if it's out there at 
<br />
all, I'll find it. If there are several candidate &quot;next moments&quot;, including 
<br />
ones where I have suffered partial memory loss, which one I (that is, one 
<br />
version of me) experience will seem to be determined probabilistically. And 
<br />
if there are no candidate next moments at all, then I die.
<br />
<br />I have used &quot;I&quot; rather loosely and without defining it because there is no 
<br />
objective truth of the matter when considering personal identity. I may be 
<br />
physically completely different (i.e. comprised of different matter) today 
<br />
than I was a year ago, and my mental state and memories may only be 
<br />
approximately similar to what they were then, but I am sure I am still the 
<br />
same person, and that is what counts. If I had undergone a head injury or a 
<br />
dementing illness in the past year, I would be even less similar now than I 
<br />
was then, but I would probably still think I was the same person unless I 
<br />
was really far gone, in which case it probably would be the same as if I had 
<br />
died. These are matters millions of people deal with every day: you don't 
<br />
have to bring up multiple copies in other worlds.
