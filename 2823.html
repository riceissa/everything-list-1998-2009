<br />Thank you for being interested.  Please understand that I do not have a
<br />
background in philosophy, logic or computer science, per se.  I am only
<br />
interested in what can work in a way that is easy to understand.
<br />
<br />I joined the everything list because I am interested in AI. Actually,
<br />
I'm interested in what I was calling &quot;Real AI&quot; ... and now I find some
<br />
people are referring to it as &quot;New AI,&quot; and this is somewhat good as
<br />
I no longer think I am alone in the direction I chose and I feel
<br />
safe unencrypting my efforts.
<br />
<br />I have been thinking about AI as a past-time since about 1988 and I can
<br />
remembering tinkering a little long before that. My current goal has
<br />
been to implement a system that is capable of unrestrained evolution,
<br />
but evolution based on Intelligence -- not wet-ware.  This system
<br />
doesn't have to be perfect, mathematically sound or proveably complete.
<br />
It just needs to work.
<br />
<br />To do this, I was trying to come up with my own theory of everything
<br />
that I could use to code.  If I can understand the scope of something --
<br />
I can code it.
<br />
<br />What I see on this list is a lot of smart people who argue about the one
<br />
true way.  I'm not really interested in the one true way -- just any one
<br />
way that (is sufficient and) works.  I have been trying to gather any
<br />
little bit of insight from this list during the time that I have been
<br />
watching it.
<br />
<br />I have come up with:
<br />
Difference is not the same, even when it's the same difference.
<br />
Difference is not the same, even if it's the same difference.
<br />
<br />I can't decide over the difference of those two, that is -- which I
<br />
prefer.  I doesn't seem to matter too much as it all comes back to
<br />
language being meaningless at the lowest level anyway.  I have posted
<br />
this difference thing to the list and, of course, it was ripped apart. 
<br />
I have yet to get a clear response from anyone, especially people  who
<br />
think that time doesn't exist.  The reason why I have been pursuing that
<br />
so strongly is I am basing everything on the fact that &quot;everything&quot; 
<br />
doesn't (or can't) happen at once.
<br />
<br />I have been able to explain everything using this quirky little ToE and
<br />
since I can code this ToE, I am quite satisfied.
<br />
<br />To me, if there isn't difference, then everything is the same.  To go to
<br />
the opposite, right when there is difference, how can this be
<br />
determined?  It just seemed to me that when there is difference, it is
<br />
then possible to start to define things -- that is, things are no longer
<br />
all the same (ie: things are defined by difference, not by sameness --
<br />
we define things through differentiation).  The issue is how to tell
<br />
what is different?  I can't quite come up with an intelligent enough way
<br />
to explain this, but it's basically that if there isn't time, everything
<br />
is the same.  There are no two different points to use as what this list
<br />
might call observer moments, there would be only 1 observer moment --
<br />
and I'd go so far to claim that then that observer moment was really
<br />
impossible (at least from within the system).   All of this crazy and
<br />
seemingly circular musing just lead me to base my ToE on the
<br />
fundamental building block of &quot;difference&quot; ...
<br />
<br />In order to code a system that has real AI, I came up with the follwing
<br />
ways to define things so I could code them:
<br />
<br />Knowledge is when predicted.
<br />
Concepts are reduction or expansion of knowledge.
<br />
Meaning is a concept that is relative and arbitrary.
<br />
Reasoning is the ability to create meaning through explanation.
<br />
Intelligence is the ability to judge better or worse via reasoning.
<br />
Communication is to convey meaning over language, which is arbitary.
<br />
Life desires sameness, but exists only in a world of difference.
<br />
Life desires sameness, but existence is only difference.
<br />
<br />The last two lines show the circle and how the system becomes a
<br />
perpetual-motion machine.  The idea behind those lines is that the term
<br />
on the left is what we humans tend to reference when talking about life,
<br />
learning and intelligence.  The stuff after the word &quot;is&quot; is how I plan
<br />
to achieve the words at the left  (the last line could be: Life
<br />
is difference, but desires sameness).
<br />
<br />So:
<br />
<br />differentiate - discern - store   - recall  = biological learning
<br />
approximate   - choose  - predict - compare = computational learning
<br />
<br />I recently switched jobs, but I should be able to get back to some 
<br />
coding RSN (I hope), but this was mostly finalized by Dec 25, 2000.
<br />
Coding was started then.  To me, this is extremely exciting.
<br />
<br />I have been coding the &quot;biological&quot; side of this system.  Basically,
<br />
it's an IO system based around UNIX sockets where the system can
<br />
create/destroy new &quot;connections&quot; itself.  This is just the way I chose
<br />
to model my ideas -- it's not the only way possible.  Anyway, I am using
<br />
these IO paths as senses.  The system then automatically &quot;nodifies&quot; the
<br />
inputs/outputs of these senses so that it can learn, biologically, from
<br />
its environment. This is done so that some &quot;learning&quot; is inherent to the
<br />
system, at least at the &quot;biological&quot; level -- but it is all based on 
<br />
the Difference ToE.
<br />
<br />So, the premise is that if the system knows certain things biologically,
<br />
then perhaps that could be the foundation for a higher level.  What 
<br />
does it mean to &quot;know&quot; something?  Well, at the biological level,  it
<br />
means that what the system is currently trying to figure out if it
<br />
&quot;knows&quot; is either already stored or not.  So, this stuff is &quot;nodified&quot;
<br />
(ie: discerned).  However, part of nodifying/storing is that the same
<br />
sense doesn't create two nodes for the same thing, so the system will
<br />
know, at least biologically, if it has experienced this sense before.
<br />
<br />The next level is computational.  By comparing some possibilities and if
<br />
one matches, this means that the system &quot;knows&quot; on a computational
<br />
level.  Example:  physics .... somehow we can predict the path of
<br />
projectile with great accuracy.  To me, this means we &quot;know&quot; something
<br />
(and more than likely actually &quot;know&quot; many things in order to do this,
<br />
but that's not the argument).  That's an advanced example, but I think
<br />
it can be reduced down to things such as syntax, grammar, etc.
<br />
<br />The bottom line here is that, so far, I haven't found a single person
<br />
who can break my ToE or the terms as how I have them defined above.
<br />
Since I can code what I have defined above -- I am satisfied. I also use
<br />
that list to try to reduce what people are saying on this list to see if
<br />
anything new is happening, instead of the seemingly constant vicious
<br />
circle of bickering over nits.  I'd rather simply evolve bits.

<br />
<br />ps:
<br />
<br />So, to code an AI --
<br />
<br />Knowledge is when predicted.
<br />
&nbsp;If something can be predicted, then that &quot;something&quot; is &quot;knowledge&quot;
<br />
<br />Concepts are reduction or expansion of knowledge.
<br />
&nbsp;The system will perform certain tasks in order to predict.
<br />
&nbsp;When this same &quot;certain tasks&quot; can be used to predict more than
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;one single instance, then this is a &quot;concept&quot; ... that is, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;this procedure is taken itself to be something.
<br />
<br />Meaning is a concept that is relative and arbitrary.
<br />
&nbsp;Meaning is simply a concept.  Meaning, like language, is simply
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;brought about by consensus.  Meaning doesn't have to be right/correct,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;it only has to be a concept that is accepted (to the entity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;itself, or shared with other entities).
<br />
<br />Reasoning is the ability to create meaning through explanation.
<br />
&nbsp;This is also similar to predicting.  However, this uses the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rules (logic?) of reasoning, vs the end point.  Again, reasoning
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't have to be correct, it only has to be a concept.  This
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is similar to concepts, except that this is almost like the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;act&quot; of creating a concept.
<br />
<br />Intelligence is the ability to judge better or worse via reasoning.
<br />
&nbsp;This is the crux.  Intelligence is simply a (I forget what the CS
<br />
&nbsp;people call this... I'm sure the minute I send this damn post
<br />
&nbsp;I'll remember) ... way to determine when something is better or
<br />
&nbsp;worse.  This is completely arbitrary because an entity can
<br />
&nbsp;choose to believe that something is better or worse regardless 
<br />
&nbsp;of any relation to &quot;reality&quot; ... but this is still intelligence,
<br />
&nbsp;as the &quot;fitness&quot; of the entity is compared to others.
<br />
<br />Communication is to convey meaning over language, which is arbitary.
<br />
&nbsp;See Meaning.  To me, communication is simply a symbolizing of
<br />
&nbsp;concepts -- that is, communication is meaning.  It's relative
<br />
&nbsp;and arbitrary.  It's thhat the purpose of communication is different
<br />
&nbsp;than that of meaning and concepts.
<br />
<br />Life desires sameness, but exists only in a world of difference.
<br />
Life desires sameness, but existence is only difference.
<br />
&nbsp;If there only sameness, there is nothing.  When there is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;difference, life seems to want to figure out why.  Figuring out
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;why means seeking the sameness (which doesn't exist).  This
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is what people might call &quot;will&quot; or &quot;purpose (of life)&quot; ... etc.
<br />
<br /><br />There are, of course, other little things that need to be in place in
<br />
this system, but they are minor as compared to the overall philosophy.
<br />
<br />The other simple things is that this system can't evolve in a vacuum.
<br />
That is, a system can not go outside its bounds, but through interacting
<br />
with its environment, the system expands its universe beyond what it
<br />
could ever hope to understand fully -- and this is enough to drive it
<br />
perpetually.
