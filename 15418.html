Hi everyone!
<br />
<br />My name is Abram Demski. My interest, when it comes to this list, is:
<br />
what is the correct logic, the logic that can refer to (and reason
<br />
about) any mathematical structure? The logic that can define
<br />
everything definable? If every possible universe exists, then of
<br />
course we've got to ask which universes are possible. As someone
<br />
mentioned recently, a sensible approach is to take the logically
<br />
consistent ones. So, I'm asking: in what logic?
<br />
<br />I am also interested in issues of specifying a probability
<br />
distribution over these probabilities, and what such a probability
<br />
distribution really means. Again there was some recent discussion on
<br />
this... I was very tempted to comment, but I wanted to lurk a while to
<br />
get the idea of the group before posting my join post.
<br />
<br />Following is my view on what the big questions are when it comes to
<br />
specifying the correct logic.
<br />
<br />The first two big puzzles are presented to us by Godel's
<br />
incompleteness theorem and Tarski's undefinability theorem. The way I
<br />
see it, Godel's theorem presents a &quot;little&quot; puzzle, which points us in
<br />
the direction of the &quot;big&quot; puzzle presented by Tarski's theorem.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godel%27s_theorem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godel%27s_theorem</a>
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarski%27s_undefinability_theorem</a>
<br />
<br />The little puzzle is this: Godel's theorem tells us that any
<br />
sufficiently strong logic does not have a complete set of deduction
<br />
rules; the axioms will fail to capture all truths about the logical
<br />
entities we're trying to talk about. But if these entities cannot be
<br />
completely axiomized, then in what sense are they well-defined? How is
<br />
logic logical, if it is doomed to be incompletely specified? One way
<br />
out here is to say that numbers (which happen to be the logical
<br />
entities that Godel showed were doomed to incompleteness, though of
<br />
course the incompleteness theorem has since been generalized to other
<br />
domains) really are incompletely specified: the axioms are incomplete
<br />
in that they fail to prove every sentence about numbers either true or
<br />
false, but they are complete in that the ones they miss are in some
<br />
sense actually not specified by our notion of number. I don't like
<br />
this answer, because it is equivalent to saying that the halting
<br />
problem really has no answer in the cases where it is undecidable.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem</a>
<br />
<br />Instead, I prefer to say that while decidable facts correspond to
<br />
finite computations, undecidable facts simply correspond to infinite
<br />
computations; so, there is still a well-defined procedure for deciding
<br />
them, it simply takes too long for us to complete. For the case of
<br />
number theory, this can be formalized with the arithmetical hierarchy:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetical_hierarchy</a>
<br />
<br />Essentially, each new quantifier amounts to a potentially infinite
<br />
number of cases we need to check. There are similar hierarchies for
<br />
broader domains:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperarithmetical_hierarchy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperarithmetical_hierarchy</a>
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_hierarchy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_hierarchy</a>
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_hierarchy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projective_hierarchy</a>
<br />
<br />This brings us to the &quot;big&quot; puzzle. To specify the logic an refer to
<br />
any structure I want, I need to define the largest of these
<br />
hierarchies: a hierarchy that includes all truths of mathematics.
<br />
Unfortunately, Tarski's undefinability theorem presents a roadblock to
<br />
this project: If I can use logic L to define a hierarchy H, then H
<br />
will necessarily fail to include all truths of L. To describe the
<br />
hierarchy of truths for L, I will always need a more powerful language
<br />
L+1. Tarski proved this under some broad assumptions; since Tarski's
<br />
theorem completely blocks my project, it appears I need to examine
<br />
these assumptions and reject some of them.
<br />
<br />I am, of course, not the first to pursue such a goal. There is an
<br />
abundant literature on theories of truth. From what I've seen, the
<br />
important potential solutions are Kripke's fixed-points, revision
<br />
theories, and paraconsistent theories:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke#Truth">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Kripke#Truth</a>
<br />
<a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-revision/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-revision/</a>
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraconsistent_logic">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraconsistent_logic</a>
<br />
<br />All of these solutions create reference gaps: they define a language L
<br />
that can talk about all of its truths, and therefore could construct
<br />
its own hierarchy in one sense, but in addition to simple true and
<br />
false more complicated truth-states are admitted that the language
<br />
cannot properly refer to. For Kripke's theory, we are unable to talk
<br />
about the sentences that are neither-true-nor-false. For revision
<br />
theories, we are unable to talk about which sentences have unstable
<br />
truth values or multiple stable truth values. In paraconsistent logic,
<br />
we are able to refer to sentences that are both-true-and-false, but we
<br />
can't state within the language that a statement is *only* true or
<br />
*only* false (to my knowledge; paraconsistent theory is not my strong
<br />
suit). So using these three theories, if we want a hierarchy that
<br />
defines all the truth value *combinations* within L, we're still out
<br />
of luck.
<br />
<br /><br />As I said, I'm also interested in the notion of probability. I
<br />
disagree with Solomonoff's universal distribution
<br />
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Solomonoff">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Solomonoff</a>), because it assumes that
<br />
the universe is computable. I cannot say whether the universe we
<br />
actually live in is computable or not; however, I argue that,
<br />
regardless, an uncomputable universe is at least conceivable, even if
<br />
it has a low credibility. So, a universal probability distribution
<br />
should include that possibility.
<br />
<br />I also want to know exactly what it means to measure a probability. I
<br />
think use of subjective probabilities is OK; a probability can reflect
<br />
a state of belief. But, I think the reason that this is an effective
<br />
way of reasoning is because these subjective probabilities tend to
<br />
converge to the &quot;true&quot; probabilities as we gain experience. It seems
<br />
to me that this &quot;true probability&quot; needs to be a frequency. It also
<br />
seems to me that this would be meaningful even in universes that
<br />
actually happened to have totally deterministic physics-- so by a
<br />
&quot;true probability&quot; I don't mean to imply a physically random outcome,
<br />
though I don't mean to rule it out either (like uncomputable
<br />
universes, I think it should be admitted as possible).
<br />
<br />Well, I think that is about it. For now.
<br />
