</em><br />
<br />I fail to see any 'knock-down' character in this argument. Peter says
<br />
that mathematical concepts don't refer to anything 'external', and on
<br />
one level I agree with him. But they are surely derived from the
<br />
contingent characteristics of experience, and AFAICS experience in this
<br />
context reduces to the contents of our brains. So 'infinite sets' is
<br />
just a model (brain material at another level of description) which IMO
<br />
counts as a 'physical notion' unless you start off as an idealist. Put
<br />
simply, you can't think mathematical thoughts without using your brain
<br />
to instantiate them - and you don't literally have to instantiate an
<br />
'infinite set' in the extended sense in order to manipulate a model
<br />
with the formal characteristics you impute to this concept. In fact,
<br />
the inability to convert infinite and transfinite sets into physical
<br />
notions is excellent empirical evidence that they *don't* exist in any
<br />
literal sense -  they don't need to, as their usefulness is as limit
<br />
cases within models, not as literal existents (nobody has ever
<br />
literally deployed an infinite set).
<br />
<br />This is a thoroughgoing contingentist position, and I don't see that it
<br />
can be refuted except by rejecting contingentism and starting from
<br />
idealism. But then you've begged what you're trying to prove.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  'If according to the simplest explanation, an entity is complex and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; autonomous, then that entity is real.' ('The Fabric Of Reality', Pg 91)
</em><br />
<br />Autonomous of what precisely? In what sense is a mathematical concept
<br />
autonomous of your brain, or the collection of brains and other
<br />
recording devices that instantiate it? Remember that we're talking
<br />
about mathematical *concepts* - i.e. things we can grasp - it's merely
<br />
a metaphor to claim that these models *refer* to autonomously existing
<br />
platonic realities. Either a metaphor, or the presumption of such
<br />
platonic reality, not its proof.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As Detusch points out, mathematical entities do appear to match the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; criteria for reality: 'Abstract entities that are complex and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; autonomous exist objectively and are part of the fabric of reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There exist logically necessary truths about these entities, and these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comprise the subject-matter of mathematics.'
</em><br />
<br />Truths are only equivalent to 'existents' for an idealist. Fair enough,
<br />
but then this has to be accepted axiomatically, or not at all. I can't
<br />
honestly see why this is so hard to grasp.
<br />
<br />David
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;But why can't it be reduced to classes of specific physical things? How
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;can you show that it is necessary for anything corresponding to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;description to 'exist' apart from its instantiations as documented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;procedures and actual occurrences of their application?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Language, logic, and math are human inventions just as chair is, c.f. William S.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Cooper &quot;The Evolution of Reason&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;That chair would continue to exist even if all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humans were wiped off the Earth - but the concept of 'chairs' wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and neither
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would '2'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Ontology is invented too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Brent Meeker
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I distinguish between two kinds of abstract concepts - abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts of universal applicability, which I think are objectively real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and abstract concepts of limited applicability, which are clearly human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inventions.  You don't accept the distinction.  But I pointed out that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for abstract concepts of universal applicability, there appears to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no difference between cognitive and ontological categories, where as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for abstract concepts of limited applicability, there clearly is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference between cognitive and ontologic categories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I would tend to say that the concept of '2' is clearly 'out there',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where as the concept of 'chair' is 'in our heads' and quite possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even the concrete instances of a 'chair' is 'in our heads' as well!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After all, is it really the case that a chair is an object 'out there'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with definite objective physical dimensions like length?  Isn't it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually the case that all that's 'out there' is a 4-dimensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'chair' world-time? - which I point out to you as really a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *mathematical construct* ;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Actually, it's an arguement against doing so. If mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;terms referred to particular things, they would not be universally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;applicable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;They are universally applicable because they don't refer to anything.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;1Z
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Math concepts are super-classes or abstract classes being used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; classify *other* astract classes.  I pointed out three different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ontological catgories:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1)  Abstract entities of universal applicability (like math concepts)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2)  Abstract entities of limited applicability (human constructs like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alphabets or a chair concept)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3) Concrete instances (like a particular example of a chair)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd say you can make a good case that the entities in (1) are the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real objective reality.  It's (2) and (3) that are actually 'in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heads'!
