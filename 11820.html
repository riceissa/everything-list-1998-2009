&lt;snip de moi&gt;
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; That is, the assumption that zombies are functionally identical. I can
</em><br />
show that a zombie cannot be physically identical because to get a
<br />
zombie
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you have to alter the brain. Everything else stays the same. As a result,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the functional defininitive benchmark behaviour &quot;scientific behaviour&quot;,
</em><br />
cannot be done by a zombie. (see below)
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that case, you have proved by contradiction that zombies don't exist.
</em><br />
A very different result. I believe that is already a known result within
<br />
computationalism, although I'm no expert in these
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matters. However, since I'm not sure you start from computationalism, it
</em><br />
may well be a new result anyway.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Of course this will depend on the definition of computationalism. My only
<br />
characterisation is that STUFF (my noun that of which which all is made)
<br />
literally is computation. Not an abstraction running on a substrate made
<br />
of STUFF. In that context, if a UD was to be reified, then the UD and
<br />
everything hooked to it are literally a computation in STUFF that is doing
<br />
an abstracted computation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;....nobody has ever said UD's are conscious. If computationalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; is true, then they are executing conscious programs, but they're not
</em><br />
conscious themselves.
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Then what use is the UD? If I embody something with a UD (assuming the
</em><br />
computational grunt (and requisite sensing) can be built with the STUFF
<br />
(this is the noun I will use to mean a chunk of the natural world) then
<br />
the UD cannot do science on the natural world. It doesn;t even know
<br />
it's
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in the natural world. It does science on regularities sensory feeds. It
</em><br />
would look bizarre to us and perform no useful function wahtever.
<br />
Except
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perhaps as a metaphor to use to discuss our place in the real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
russel:
<br />
The UD is a very simple program that executes all programs
<br />
&quot;concurrently&quot; (by which I mean that all programs will have a finite
<br />
number of steps executed within a finite number of steps of the UD
<br />
executed, not that there is an external time in which the programs
<br />
execute simultaneously).
<br />
<br />Assuming computationalism, some of these computations will correspond
<br />
to conscious machines and all possible input tapes. There is some
<br />
debate as to whether a machine with no input tape can truly be
<br />
conscious - I don't think there can be, as there is no self/other
<br />
distinction.
<br />
<br />Taking my POV that input tapes are essential, then the UD cannot be
<br />
conscious itself (as it has no input tape), nor can the Multiverse. I
<br />
don't think the universe is conscious either - only small bits of
<br />
it. Most of the universe is input tape.
<br />
<br />This is perhaps only a definitional nuance, but I don't think it is useful
<br />
to call an inputless machine conscious. What do others think?
<br />
=============
<br />
colin:
<br />
The UD without embodiment is not in our universe. I don;t know where it
<br />
is...the universe of the platonic realm used for the abstractions. It may
<br />
be able to say something about the platonic realm. Very interesting
<br />
but...then what?
<br />
<br />If you then embody the UD with a 'tape'(IN and OUT = sensory/actuation)
<br />
you have a device that has no idea of how the real universe works trying
<br />
to make sense out of it when all its knowledge it has is of a different
<br />
universe. It has no awareness of our universe ...indeed no real awareness
<br />
of anything at all.
<br />
<br />My benchmark behaviour - scientific behaviour - is the key to enabling a
<br />
structured analysis of the situation. This behaviour is the only behaviour
<br />
where phenomenasl life is translated unambigously into something verified
<br />
(a natural law) outside the scientist, which other scientists can use. You
<br />
can't get a zombie to play a tennis match with the scientist and prove
<br />
anything. :-) However you can present the zombia and the scientist with
<br />
the same exquisite novelty and see which one gets to the law of nature
<br />
characterising it. The zombie will fail, predictably. Indeed the failure
<br />
of the zombie in this circumstance is the proof that phenomenal
<br />
consciousness exists and is necessary for scientific behaviour.
<br />
<br />So if the UD is a zombie?..... ergo... what? COMP is false? have to think
<br />
about that.
<br />
<br />...back to the paper....nearly there...
<br />
<br />cheers, colin
