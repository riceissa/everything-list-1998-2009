John Collins had written
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;..You [Hal] are working from the assumption that each person has some sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;transcendental identity that experiences these observer moments, but I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;think it more likely that these would be included in the observer moment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;with memories being distinguished from &quot;instantaneous&quot; thoughts just by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;their being repeated several (or even millions of) times.
</em><br />
<br />You reject the reified notion of a &quot;transcendental identity&quot; that
<br />
experiences diverse observer moments. But I don't quite see why.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;As an illustration, try and remember what you had for dinner on your fifth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;birthday. Whether you remember or not, you only know if you remember when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you try to recall it, so you can't really pretend the piece of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is continuously present.
</em><br />
<br />An important point! Every so often I have to remember that I
<br />
studied the clarinet as a boy; but that doesn't ever seem to
<br />
affect me except on the very rare occasions that something
<br />
reminds me of it.
<br />
<br />So at any given moment &quot;I&quot; am that which is perceiving thus-
<br />
and-such, and is having a certain reaction to it. (There is
<br />
another equally important but separate way---almost along
<br />
another axis, as it were---that I *am* my memories, and that
<br />
it is my memories, my values, and all the rest of my baggage
<br />
that I strive to get more runtime for.)
<br />
<br />Brent comments on John's statements:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree there is reason to postulate a transcendent observer; I'm content with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical observer.  That's one of the things that bothers me about &quot;observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments&quot;, but I think it's just English grammar that pushes us to have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject.
</em><br />
<br />I'm sorry. Could you elaborate a bit on that? Firstly, a *physical*
<br />
observer is just one, or one of a class of, observers. Do you mean
<br />
that every observer must have a physical substrate of some kind?
<br />
I'd readily agree!  A person may indeed be a program (I personally
<br />
believe it), but until it gets instanced, i.e., instantiated in some
<br />
piece of hardware, it's got no more life than a book on a shelf.
<br />
<br />So criticizing &quot;observer-moment&quot; as a noun, you are cautioning us
<br />
against unnecessary reification; that we might keep out ideas
<br />
clearer if take the trouble to write out more meaningful phrases
<br />
and sentences?  I could believe it.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you meant, &quot;I agree that there is *no* reason to postulate
<br />
a transcendent observer&quot;.  It would fit better with what you wrote
<br />
next.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you're going to reconstruct physics from discrete subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences you need to be able to collect and order experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; according from [that] viewpoint - which corresponds to an &quot;observer&quot; -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and according to intersubjective agreement among observers -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which corresponds to the physical world.
</em><br />
<br />Evidently that program appeals to some!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But just because the subjective observer is a construct, doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; justify the pejorative &quot;pretend&quot;.  I think I have considerable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence for information, such as what I ate for breakfast, being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persistently encoded in my brain.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, that's the simplest explanation! We have to suppose that
<br />
physical objects continue to encode previously gained information
<br />
in the default case.
<br />
<br />But what John was perhaps saying---and what I would certainly
<br />
claim along with all the adherents of &quot;observer-moments&quot;, I
<br />
think---is that any particular version of you at any particular
<br />
moment is not conscious of the facts encoded in all your memories.
<br />
Hence the idea that an observer-moment is the net intersection
<br />
across the multiverse and across other planetary systems of a
<br />
particular sense-perception experience of a particular person.
<br />
<br />Lee
