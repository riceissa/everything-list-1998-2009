&quot;I've no idea why we might be being simulated if we are being simulated. It
<br />
is actually very arrogant to assume that we are somehow the centre of the
<br />
simulation at all, like bacteria in my gut assuming that the universe, the
<br />
solar sysstem, humans were made for their benefit. &quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Stathis Papaioannou
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I have a problem with the very premise of asking why we are being simulated.
<br />
Having been a member of this list for years, I have seen objections to the
<br />
simulation argument raised repeatedly that are along the lines of &quot;it is
<br />
presumptuous to assume anyone would want to simulate us,&quot; or &quot;it is entirely
<br />
speculative and not based in science&quot;, etc.  I have also seen a fair amount
<br />
of discussion about how the simulation could be done.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />To me, the logical chain is straightforward.  If you accept a MWI
<br />
interpretation or some other ensemble theory, then everything that can
<br />
happen does happen.  There is maybe a little wiggle room here, as perhaps
<br />
you can have a MWI with an enormous number of universes versus and infinite
<br />
number, depending on the nature of the underlying implementation, but as I
<br />
understand it from earlier discussions and from my reading, most interpret
<br />
MWI as requiring an actual infinity.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Now, after you have the MWI as the underlying foundation, there is really
<br />
only one additional question that needs to be answered.  Is there something
<br />
fundamentally primitively &quot;physical&quot; and non-reproducible about my existence
<br />
that would forever prohibit any attempt at reproduction?  When I say &quot;my
<br />
existence&quot; you have to include two possibilities.  First, if you want to
<br />
hold onto the &quot;primitive physical&quot; viewpoint you have to assume that there
<br />
is something about the nature of our apparent reality in the third person
<br />
that is simply not capable of emulation or simulation.  Second, you ALSO
<br />
have to assume there is something about our first person experience that is
<br />
also not capable of emulation or simulation.  This is where the &quot;primitive
<br />
physical&quot; proponents lose me.  I have thought about this a great deal, and
<br />
just can't figure out why I should assume there is something so special
<br />
about my experiences, memories, and thought process that it under no
<br />
circumstances could ever be capable of reproduction anywhere else in
<br />
existence (other than the &quot;naturally&quot; occurring copies of myself in other
<br />
parts of the multiverse, which are of course under this line of thinking
<br />
occurring at a &quot;primitive physical&quot; level).  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I am an attorney, so I guess I look at this at a little different
<br />
perspective than most on here with science related backgrounds.  I think
<br />
once you get to a certain level, whether it be with MWI, or string theory or
<br />
any other concept that can not be directly tested or observed, science loses
<br />
its ability to take you further and you have to look into other areas such
<br />
as logic and philosophy to finish the journey.  However, there is a
<br />
circumstantial case to be made for things even beyond strict science.  For
<br />
instance, I believe the circumstantial case for our universe being emulable
<br />
or simulable is strong given what we know about how our universe works so
<br />
far.  The reasons for this have probably been discussed around here
<br />
extensively, for instance the close relationship between math and physics,
<br />
and our ability to describe the things we observe in mathematical terms.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />To my way of thinking, the opponents to a simulation viewpoint are basically
<br />
left arguing a concept that there is something &quot;magical&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot;
<br />
about human thought.  That it is a supernatural function that is forever
<br />
beyond the realm of science.  Either that or they do not accept an ensemble
<br />
theory.    I could not disagree more with your statement that it is
<br />
&quot;arrogant to assume that we are somehow the center of the simulation.&quot;  On
<br />
the contrary, what is arrogant is to assume that in a universe in which it
<br />
is possible to simulate environments and universes (and this we know, just
<br />
check out a Playstation 3 game I will say only partially tongue in cheek),
<br />
is that we occupy a special location at the very top (or bottom depending on
<br />
how you look at it) of this hierarchy of natural and artificial creations.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />I think one thing that hangs a lot of people up on this concept is the idea
<br />
that somewhere there IS a primitive, physical universe, and that we are just
<br />
a digital simulation being run in that &quot;more real&quot; universe.  This is NOT
<br />
necessary nor is it part of my thinking on the subject.  Maybe there is some
<br />
&quot;more real&quot; or &quot;primitive physical&quot; reality out there that is simulating our
<br />
entire quantum mechanical multiverse, but this is entirely speculative and
<br />
presumably beyond the realm of any potential scientific discussion.  When I
<br />
refer to our being simulated, I am assuming the simulation is occurring in
<br />
every way that is logically and physically possible in the multiverse, just
<br />
as every other part of the multiverse is being likewise simulated in every
<br />
way that is logically and physically possible in some other part.  This is
<br />
required, in fact is logically necessary if you assume it is capable of
<br />
simulation.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />That is as far as I think logic can take us.  All the different theoretical
<br />
ways that we can be emulated or simulated or of course interesting
<br />
discussion.  Why some intelligent beings in some other part of the
<br />
multiverse may want to simulate or emulate our part of the multiverse is
<br />
interesting as well, but is entirely unrelated to the logic of whether the
<br />
entire entity is at least in part a simulation as set forth above.
