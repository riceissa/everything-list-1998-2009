Hi,
<br />
<br />Ok Tom, put your security belt because we will leave the constructive 
<br />
area, because it is the price we need to pay, in front of machine, for 
<br />
NOT leaving the finite area.
<br />
<br />Let me recall the problem.
<br />
<br />1) Obviously the set of all computable function from the set of natural 
<br />
number N to the set of natural numbers N is countable (synonym: 
<br />
enumerable, in bijection with N). The reason is that a computable 
<br />
function, by definition, has a code (synonym: a description, a program, 
<br />
a finite machine), that is any finite things which can be used by some 
<br />
entity/machine for computing the functions, and (infinite) sets of 
<br />
finite things are always (infinite and) countable.
<br />
Note that a (one) computable function is an infinite object, but giving 
<br />
that that infinite set is computable and generable from a code, the set 
<br />
of computable functions is in bijection with the set of their codes, 
<br />
which itself is in bijection with N, and so the infinite set of 
<br />
infinite objects which are the computable function is in bijection with 
<br />
N.
<br />
<br />2) Now it looks like we have already a contradiction. let us write f1 
<br />
for the computable function having the least code, f2 the second one, 
<br />
etc.  So we get the sequence f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, ... fn, .... And let 
<br />
us define the function g by
<br />
<br />g(n) = fn(n) + 1
<br />
<br />It looks like g is computable isn't it. All fn are computable and can 
<br />
be computed on each n, and certainly adding one (&quot;the + 1&quot;) is 
<br />
computable too. Right?
<br />
<br />Well, if you say &quot;all right&quot; here, we are in trouble. Because if g is 
<br />
really computable, then g is in the sequence of all computable 
<br />
functions fi. But then *there is* a k such that g = fk, and then g(k) 
<br />
is equal to both fk(k) and fk(k)+1, and that gives 0 = 1, by 
<br />
substracting the well-defined number fk(k).
<br />
<br />So g just cannot be a computable!
<br />
<br />How could g looks like being computable? It is true that all fn are 
<br />
computable, and it is obviously true that &quot;+ 1&quot; is computable.
<br />
So, the only thing which is not computable is .... the bijection 
<br />
itself, between N and the fi.
<br />
<br />It is the correspondence:
<br />
<br />1 --- f1
<br />
2 --- f2
<br />
3 --- f3
<br />
4 --- f4
<br />
....
<br />
<br />which is NOT computable! There is just no algorithm which can generate 
<br />
the sequence of codes of the computable functions from N to N. So, 
<br />
although each fn is a computable function (from N to N), you cannot 
<br />
diagonalize it for getting g, because to compute g on n, g(n) you need 
<br />
to generate the n first programs corresponding to f1, f2, f3, ... fn, 
<br />
and then apply it to n (and then add one), but you just will never been 
<br />
able to give me a finite set of instructions for doing that. If {f1, 
<br />
f2, f3, ...} are all computable function from N to N, and if the 
<br />
sequence is complete (con,tains all such function) then g, although 
<br />
mathematically well defined, is just not programmable.
<br />
<br /><br />BUT THEN .....
<br />
<br />Saying this, it could look like the Universal Dovetailer is still in 
<br />
peril. But I have given you the shape of the solution when I show you 
<br />
the proof of the existence of a irrational number which exponentiated 
<br />
to an irrational number gives a rational number. That precise problem 
<br />
is irrelevant, but the non constructive reasoning I did to prove it is 
<br />
very relevant here. I was telling that there exist some mathematical 
<br />
object, but I was unable to give it. I was only able to give you a bow 
<br />
with the shape
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ a   b }
<br />
<br />telling you the &quot;solution&quot; was in that box (but not saying if it was a 
<br />
or if it was b).
<br />
<br />The same here, but with an infinite box. I cannot generate mechanically 
<br />
the set {f1, f2, f3, ...} of computable functions, but there is still 
<br />
hope (Church Thesis CT will just express that hope) that I can generate 
<br />
some BIGGER set, containing all computable functions AND MANY OTHER 
<br />
THINGS TOO. The hope is that the OTHER THINGS will help us escaping the 
<br />
diagonal contradiction.
<br />
<br />Well, actually CT says more: it says not only that there is a universal 
<br />
language/machine, but that fortran is such a one! And fortran programs 
<br />
are fortran generable, so I can generate a sequence of all fortran 
<br />
one-variable program F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 .... (&quot;all&quot; means that 
<br />
soon or later this sequence goes trough any fortran programs: it is of 
<br />
course an infinite set)
<br />
<br />So, given that the sequence F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, ... is generable, the 
<br />
corresponding diagonal function G defined by
<br />
<br />G(n) = Fn(n) + 1
<br />
<br />*is* programmable in fortran. So there *is* a k such that G = Fk
<br />
<br />And what will happen if I apply G on its own number-code k?
<br />
<br />Just this: your machine will crash! The fortran interpreter will go in 
<br />
loop or in an infinite computations.
<br />
<br />Well, in some formal sense I will get G(k) = G(k) + 1. But I can no 
<br />
more substract G(k) on both sides like we have always do at that stage, 
<br />
because G(k) is just not a well-defined number.
<br />
It looks like the OTHER THINGS are the function from a subset of N to 
<br />
N. Functions, now, if we want to associate them to the fortran 
<br />
programs, can be only partially defined functions.
<br />
<br />So I can still  hope the sequence Fi of Fortran programs goes trough, 
<br />
among OTHER THINGS, all computable functions everywhere defined, but 
<br />
the price will be that I will got the undefined programmable functions 
<br />
by the same token.
<br />
<br />I give you an infinite box:
<br />
<br />{F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 F8 F9 ...}
<br />
<br />but then, I can no more use any algorithmic way to filter out the 
<br />
&quot;solutions&quot; (the computable function from N to N) from the &quot;non 
<br />
solution&quot; (the functions no more everywhere defined, or the function 
<br />
defined on proper subset of N). Why? because if I could do that, I will 
<br />
be able to build an algorithmically  sequence of everywhere defined 
<br />
computable functions, and from that, I hope you are convinced that I 
<br />
*can* prove that 0 = 1.
<br />
<br />The lesson is not yet Godel's incompleteness, but is very close: the 
<br />
price of going through the whole controllable world of computable 
<br />
functions is to accept, hidden among it, the whole uncontrollable world 
<br />
of the undefined functions. They are hidden due to that impossibility 
<br />
of filtering the code of the everywhere define functions from those who 
<br />
are not.
<br />
<br />Put in another way: all universal machine can crash. If someone want to 
<br />
sell you a computer with a so clever operating system that the machine 
<br />
never crash, then you know the machine is not universal, or the seller 
<br />
says a falsity.
<br />
<br />Hal and Jesse were close. For example:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was being a little sloppy...it's true that a non-halting program 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be equivalent to a computable function, but I think we can at least 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the set of all computable functions is a *subset* of the set of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jesse
</em><br />
<br />The key point if, I may insist, is that
<br />
<br />1) the superset (of programmable functions, not everywhere defined) is 
<br />
MECHANICALLY enumerable. You can write a fortran program generating 
<br />
their codes.
<br />
2) the subset of (computable function from N to N) is enumerable, but 
<br />
is NOT MECHANICALLY enumerable. The bijection with N exists, but is not 
<br />
programmable, in *any* programming language!
<br />
<br /><br />George ? Are you ok. Now that we have undefined functions; we will be 
<br />
interested in the domain of definition of the programmable functions, 
<br />
and those domain *are* Smullyan's reasoners (in FU). The godelized 
<br />
universe is related with the functions F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 ..., and their 
<br />
domains traditionally noted: W1 W2 W3 W4 W5 W6 W7 ....
<br />
What we have learned is that we have no algorithm to solve the Wn = N 
<br />
question (you see that? saying Wn = N is the same as saying Fn is 
<br />
defined everywhere or saying Fn is a computable function from N to N). 
<br />
It is an insolubility result. It will be easy, once we get the notion 
<br />
of &quot;theory&quot;, or &quot;chatting machine&quot;, or &quot;recursively enumerable set&quot; to 
<br />
transform that into an incompleteness theorem.
<br />
Mmh... To get G and G*, more is needed to be honest, but not so much 
<br />
more, just that some &quot;theories&quot; can follow, *in some sense*, all those 
<br />
current posts. But this, is what Smullyan shows, albeit very concisely, 
<br />
in his &quot;heart of the matter&quot;.
