Hi Kim,

cheaper ...
<br />
Would you say yes to a doctor who proposes to you an artifical brain  
<br />
which can give you new memories and new convictions?
<br />
<br />I can give you this brain, but chance are high you will wake up with  
<br />
the idea that all Europeans should be send in camps!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;--- Er ..., well, NO doctor. Thanks, I will economize for a clean  
<br />
new brain on which you will save my memories, not someone's else.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are you saying the machine may not be &quot;good enough&quot;? - that it could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somehow fail to &quot;capture the relevant instantaneous state&quot;? What might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the implications of that be?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />There are many: roughly speaking: shit will happen.
<br />
<br />You can survive with agnosology: You are blind and deaf or amnesic,  
<br />
for example, but you pretend you lost nothing in the experience.
<br />
You can survive with trouble: you feel having survive but with  
<br />
trouble: for example you have chronicle headache, and some difficulty  
<br />
to walk.
<br />
You can survive with change: you feel well, but your wife feel you are  
<br />
no more yourself
<br />
You can survive with big trouble: you are comatose, and seven doctors  
<br />
says you are dead, and three doctors say you are alive.
<br />
You survive but only in the third person sense: everybody believed you  
<br />
have survive but God knows you are a zombie.
<br />
You don't survive: you are dead: the instantaneous state is so  
<br />
crippled that no doctor can reconstitute a &quot;soul&quot; from that.
<br />
<br />I always assume the doctor 100% gifted, the machines working well, the  
<br />
substitution level rightly chosen, and the default assumptions (no  
<br />
asteroïd destroying earth during the experiments, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Don't answer that - I will shut up
</em><br />
<br /><br />Gosh! Too late!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But once we make precise the hypothesis, fictionful argument are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; less valid, and you see that once a machine bet she is a machine, by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; explicitly embracing a complete substitution of the (relative) body,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; she has to bet &quot;she&quot; is not material.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If &quot;she&quot; has enough brains and imagination to think it through, that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is OK
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes. You will seen (much later I 'm afraid) how few you need to modify  
<br />
a Universal Machine (a computer) to give her that imagination. Indeed  
<br />
she will get a little too much imagination a priori. The real work  
<br />
will eventually consists in lowering down that imagination.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - I have seen the shining light of understanding
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Thanks for telling. Of course, this is something that I will be able  
<br />
to judge only after the exam in June, or should I do a surprise  
<br />
interrogation :)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The hammer hits itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The eye sees itself move
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The tongue tastes itself
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm Zoologists are animals, but botanists are not plants. Not  
<br />
everything is capable of studying itself. Make sure you are using a  
<br />
sufficiently flexible hammer (be careful not hitting your fingers with  
<br />
this one).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Here the &quot;plan of the machine&quot;, codable by a number (and may be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; downloadable on the net), plays a role similar to Xenocrates' soul.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what if I download a corrupted version or one with a virus?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Shit will happen again. See above. It is the same if you eat corrupted  
<br />
raw meat. You can end up with a worm in the brain. Probably not a very  
<br />
funny experience.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In some sense I disagree with Xenocrates, but at this stage of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasoning, you can identify yourself with the number which encodes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; description of your body and mind, and in that sense, you are a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; number, which each evening put itself on a disk, and each morning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; choose among seven bodies to fit the day.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; With mechanism, you can save your soul on a disk.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; All right?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So that means we already exist on a disk somewhere, right...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />In a sense, this will be correct, yet I don't see how you deduce it at  
<br />
this stage. Up to now, you have to pay I don't know how much dollars  
<br />
for using a superscanning machine which copies your brain state (it  
<br />
can take month) and burn some disk with your instantaneous state  
<br />
description. And that disk is like a disk of music: it is not useful  
<br />
without some players with the right standard, and so one.
<br />
If you break the disk, you have to do another backup, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope these disks are in safe hands
</em><br />
<br /><br />Ah! You see!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not my body - I am not my brain
</em><br />
<br /><br />Assuming comp, this is unavoidable. OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can change everything and anything I want about me and still  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remain me
</em><br />
<br /><br />... provided you don't put too much mess on your backup disk ....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ergo &quot;I&quot; am an immaterial something: probably a number or a very long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bitstring which can, like any data, be crunched
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I disagree, or I agree, because the word &quot;I&quot; will appears a bit  
<br />
ambiguous. In the next post, this ambiguity will be avoided, through  
<br />
more precise definition.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see and agree - there is nobody who would argue fiercely against you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up to here? Is everyone in accord with the details up to here?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Good question.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there anything like as convincing an alternate stance?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Just notice that, by&quot; substantialising&quot; both the brain and the soul,  
<br />
you could build NON-computationalist theories.
<br />
<br /><br />OK. thanks very much for your kind attention, Kim.
<br />
<br /><br />Soon: KIM 2 (I hope you don't mind I put your name in the thread. It  
<br />
should help my own poor memory later. It is not enough to have the  
<br />
good information, you have to find it in the genuine context ...).
<br />
<br />Best,
<br />
<br />Bruno
