<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can bet you will be the one &quot;annihilated&quot; in Brussels.
</em><br />
<br />I should first mention that I did not anticipate the conclusion that
<br />
I reached when I did that analysis.  I did not expect to conclude that
<br />
teleportation like this would probably not work (speaking figurately).
<br />
This was not the starting point of the analysis, but the conclusion.
<br />
<br />The starting point was the framework I have described previously, which
<br />
can be stated very simply as that the measure of an information pattern
<br />
comes from the universal distribution of Kolmogorov.  I then applied this
<br />
analysis to specific information patterns which represent subjective,
<br />
first person lifetime experiences.  I concluded that the truncated version
<br />
which ends when the teleportation occurs would probably have higher
<br />
measure than the ones which proceed through and beyond the teleportation.
<br />
<br />Although I worked in terms of a specific physical universe, that is
<br />
a short-cut for simplicity of exposition.  The general case is to simply
<br />
ask for the K measure of each possible first-person subjective life
<br />
experience - what is the shortest program that produces each one.  I
<br />
assume that the shortest program will in fact have two parts, one which
<br />
creates a universe and the second which takes that universe as input
<br />
and produces the first-person experience record as output.
<br />
<br />This leads to a Schmidhuber-like ensemble where we would consider
<br />
all possible universes and estimate the contribution of each one to
<br />
the measure of a particular first-person experience.  It is important
<br />
though to keep in mind that in practice the only universe which adds
<br />
non-negligible measure would be the one we are discussing.  In other
<br />
words, consider the first person experience of being born, living your
<br />
life, travelling to Brussels and stepping into a teleportation machine.
<br />
A random, chaotic universe would add negligibly to the measure of this
<br />
first-person life experience.  Likewise for a universe which only evolves
<br />
six-legged aliens on some other planet.  So in practice it makes sense
<br />
to restrict our attention to the (approximately) one universe which has
<br />
third-person objective events that do add significant measure to the
<br />
instantiation of these abstract first-person experiences.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You agree that this is just equivalent of negating the comp hypothesis.=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You would not use (classical) teleportation, nor accept a digital=20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificial brain, all right? Do I miss something?
</em><br />
<br />It is perhaps best to say that I would not do these things
<br />
*axiomatically*.  Whether a particular teleportation technology would
<br />
be acceptable would depend on considerations such as I described in my
<br />
previous message.  It's possible that the theoretical loss of measure for
<br />
some teleportation technology would be small enough that I would do it.
<br />
<br />As far as using an artificial brain, again I would look to this kind of
<br />
analysis.  I have argued previously that a brain which is much smaller
<br />
or faster than the biological one should have much smaller measure, so
<br />
that would not be an appealing transformation.  OTOH an artificial brain
<br />
could be designed to have larger measure, such as by being physically
<br />
larger or perhaps by having more accurate and complete memory storage.
<br />
Then that would be appealing.
<br />
<br />I think that one of the fundamental principles of your COMP hypothesis
<br />
is the functionalist notion, that it does not matter what kind of system
<br />
instantiates a computation.  However I think this founders on the familiar
<br />
paradoxes over what counts as an instantiation.  In principle we can
<br />
come up with a continuous range of devices which span the alternatives
<br />
from non-instantiation to full instantiation of a given computation.
<br />
Without some way to distinguish these, there is no meaning to the question
<br />
of when a computation is instantiated; hence functionalism fails.
<br />
<br />My approach (not original to me) is to recognize that there is a degree
<br />
of instantiation, as I have described via the conditional Kolmogorov
<br />
measure (i.e. given a physical system, how much does it help a minimal
<br />
computation to produce the desired output).  This then leads very
<br />
naturally to the analysis I provided in my previous message, which
<br />
attempted to estimate the conditional K measure for the hypothetical
<br />
first-person computations that were being potentially instantiated by
<br />
the given third-party physical situation.
