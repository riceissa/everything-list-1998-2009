<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why is this?  Why does it turn out that our form of life (or perhaps,

</em><br />
<br />Hal put his finger on the right view: &quot;our form of life&quot; - exactly the
<br />
opposite
<br />
of what is ubiquitously said. 'These' parameters resulted in an existence in
<br />
the format how WE are, while any other set of parameters might have results
<br />
in OTHER formats, unknown, even unrecognized by us (maybe unobservable
<br />
by our sensors/logic). So I reverse the anthropic principle into: &quot;our form
<br />
of
<br />
life required exactly the parameters we found in our observations&quot;.
<br />
Hal's parenthesis includes the big 'if' I wrote as a possible
<br />
unobservability by us.
<br />
A major question, of course, is the identification of 'life', for which
<br />
biologists
<br />
and philosophers/psychologists have different formulations from Hal's:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...Self-aware subsystems...&lt;
</em><br />
which sounds good to begin with, but may go into volumes if examined in
<br />
detail. I try to cut off my identifications from a fundamentally human way
<br />
of viewing/acting, leaving open totally different 'main' systems for such
<br />
subsystem. Including (human-style?) self-awareness.
<br />
<br />The &quot;responses&quot; discovered in our physical and chemical mechanisms are very
<br />
numerous, I don't know why it would be impossible to have a (more complex,
<br />
or just different) system where such response-mechanisms include as well the
<br />
domains which WE assign to the 'intelligent mind'? (Please, do not try to
<br />
put this
<br />
into OUR societal, even biological circumstances. It is not a 'just changed'
<br />
&quot;us&quot;).
<br />
<br />Best regards

Subject: Peculiarities of our universe
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a couple of peculiarities of our universe which it would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nice if the All-Universe Hypothesis (AUH) could explain, or at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shed light on them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One is the apparent paucity of life and intelligence in our universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This was first expressed as the Fermi Paradox, i.e., where are the aliens?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As our understanding of technological possibility has grown the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has become even more acute.  It seems likely that our descendants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will engage in tremendous cosmic engineering projects in order to take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; control of the very wasteful natural processes occuring throughout space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We don't see any evidence of that.  Similarly, proposals for von Neumann
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self reproducing machines that could spread throughout the cosmos at a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; large fraction of the speed of light appear to be almost within reach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; via nanotechnology.  Again, we don't see anything like that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why is it that we live in a universe that has almost no observers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wouldn't it be more likely on anthropic grounds to live in a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that had a vast number of observers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second peculiarity is the seemingly narrow range of physical laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which could allow for our form of life to exist.  Tegmark writes about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this at <a href="http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html">http://www.hep.upenn.edu/~max/toe.html</a>.  He shows a chart of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two physical constants and how if they had departed from their observed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; values by even a tiny percentage, life would be impossible.  In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full paper linked from there he offers many more examples of physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paramters which are fine-tuned for life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So why is this?  Why does it turn out that our form of life (or perhaps,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any form of life) can exist for only a tiny range of variation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why didn't it turn out that you could change many parameters a great
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deal and still have life form?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see anything a priori in the AUH that would have led to this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prediction.  Now, it may just be one of those things that &quot;happens to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happen&quot;, a fundamental mathematical property like the distribution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primes or the absence of odd perfect numbers.  Self-aware subsystems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just mathematically turn out to only be possible in a very tiny region
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of parameter space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, you might be able to make the argument that &quot;tiny&quot; is not well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined, that there is no natural length scale for judging parameter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ranges.  Tegmark could as easily have zoomed in on the appropriate region
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of his graph and shown a huge, enormous area where parameters could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moved around and life would still work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However I think there is a more natural way to put the question, which is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what fraction of computer programs would lead to simulated universes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include observers?  And here, if we follow Tegmark's ideas, the answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appears to be that it is a very small fraction.  (Of course, you still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to use your own judgement to decide whether that is &quot;tiny&quot; or not.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a way, then, these two questions are both related, and perhaps the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same.  They both ask, why so few observers?  One question looks around the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interior of our universe, and the other looks at the set of all universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In each case, it seems that intelligent life is terribly uncommon.
</em><br />
