Hello Moshen and welcome.
<br />
<br />I think it is a very good question, and succinctly put.
<br />
<br />I have been trying to ask the same question and get a plain-English 
<br />
answer, but without success. Of course, I could be missing 'the point' 
<br />
too, and it wouldn't be the first time by a long shot. :-)
<br />
<br />If there was simply nothing, utterly and absolutely nothing, well that 
<br />
would be the end of it: 'No problemas!' as the cool dudes say. But there 
<br />
seems to be something, because I seem to be here, at the moment anyway, 
<br />
and I have this distinct belief that I was here yesterday living in this 
<br />
same house with all these recalcitrantly individualistic people who all 
<br />
play along with a story about being my wife and children. Appeals to 
<br />
solipsism degenerate into incoherent babbling; I really am here, even 
<br />
though my grasp of the facts about my existence gets shaken loose every 
<br />
so often. And you are here too, except you are over there. In short 
<br />
there IS a universe and it seems to be remarkably self-consistent.
<br />
<br />I, like you, am confronted by the manifest existence of an objective 
<br />
reality. Being educated and impressed by the successes of the 
<br />
application of scientific method we are quite well equipped to accept 
<br />
certain problematic statements about the parts of the world we normally 
<br />
take for granted as 'real'. We have learned that the *appearances* of 
<br />
solidity, power, enduring nature, and so forth, which we experience as 
<br />
*qualities* of those things, are not the full story; that in fact the 
<br />
'*true* nature of things is that if you try and find absolute objective 
<br />
boundaries to things you can't and if you try to make any other kind of 
<br />
measurement, you have to make do with an approximation. Indeed, the more 
<br />
you wish to precisely specify anything about the location or motion of 
<br />
anything then the more you must accept a complex statistical description 
<br />
about the rest of its characteristics.
<br />
<br />Well and good; normally we don't have to worry about this too much. It 
<br />
is only when we start persistently asking *How does it all work?* that 
<br />
the seemingly intractable problems begin. And for each of us there is 
<br />
some kind of recursive process: we read and interact with others  
<br />
[indeed some lucky people can apparently just wander into the next room 
<br />
and straight away *talk* on the topic with someone who is interested!], 
<br />
and then we cogitate and imagine things and some of you scribble arcane 
<br />
arithmetic and run mathematical 'what-ifs' on computers; finally we 
<br />
reach some kind of internal stability of viewpoint that allows a 
<br />
reassessment of things previously held to be clear, or problematic 
<br />
perhaps. But after some time, doubt sets in, we think something far 
<br />
enough through and see a problem or, more likely, we read of some new 
<br />
viewpoint which challenges what we believe and we feel we must take it 
<br />
seriously because of its apparent validity, consistency, etc, or it is 
<br />
presented by someone we respect. Either way we have to work to either 
<br />
assimilate it or uncover valid reasons for rejecting it.
<br />
<br />The mathematicians who contribute here seemingly have no problems with a 
<br />
totally 'insubstantial' existence of numbers. Unlike me who has 
<br />
*ultimate* problems wrapping my head around the idea. I have not yet 
<br />
succeeded. You asked about 'assumptions' in you 'Joining' thread, but 
<br />
here by definition the only one is the existence of Many Worlds, which 
<br />
is hugely problematic because nobody really knows what it means. In my 
<br />
case it is obvious why, but in the case of those who *espouse* the 
<br />
Many-Worlds hypothesis, I have absolutely know idea how they can account 
<br />
for the purely logical - and therefore mathematically necessary, yes? - 
<br />
consequence of the problem you have so succinctly put. As I reason it, 
<br />
this 'continuous' aspect of location, even if it is only 'virtual' 
<br />
guarantees that the Many Worlds are always proliferating at a rate which 
<br />
must effectively be an infinity times an infinity of infinities. [I fear 
<br />
I might have underestimated the speed there, but as I say, my maths is 
<br />
not all that good!] In other words it seems to make no sense at all! 
<br />
Why? [Grin!] well because *my* world seems to be just one story. What 
<br />
keeps it together? It can't be any inherent smartness on my part! [Grin 
<br />
again; no false modesty there mate!] So *IT*, what I call 'The Great 
<br />
IT', is just doing IT'S thing.
<br />
<br />Nobody here has yet explained in plain-English why we have entropy. Oh 
<br />
well, surely, in the Many Worlds, that's just one of the universes that 
<br />
can happen! Except that, for plain-English reasons stated above, there 
<br />
are *and always have been* infinity x infinity x infinity of entropic 
<br />
universes.
<br />
<br />It doesn't make sense.  Call me a heretic if you like, but I will 'stick 
<br />
to my guns' here: If it can't be put into plain-English then it probably 
<br />
isn't true!
<br />
<br />:-)
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />
