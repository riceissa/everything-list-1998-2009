<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without being a &quot;biological chauvinist&quot;?  ;-)The main problem I have is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that these two assumptions are mutually exclusive!
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1) Observer-moments exist: This requires that observer-moments have an

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ontological status that does not depend on anything other that they

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consistensy; they are elevated by postulation to having the same status as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mathematical tautalogies, like 1 = 1, 1+2 = 3, etc.
</em><br />
<br />Arguably, the existence of an observer-moment is *at least* as fundamental 
<br />
as the truth of a mathematical tautology. If I think or write &quot;1+2 = 3&quot; a 
<br />
little debate is implicitly generated, since this may or may not be 
<br />
consistent, depending on the meaning of the symbols etc. If I just *think*, 
<br />
from the first person perspective, there is no debate, no definitions, no 
<br />
question that I may be mistaken in thinking that I have thought. Cogito, 
<br />
ergo cogito.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2) This mysterious consciousness thing is &quot;Turing emulable&quot;: This requires 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that for ANY 1st person experience that ANY observer might have that there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist at least one string of binary numbers that, when encoded on a UTM, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will generate an simulation that if feed into a full sensory Virtual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Reality interface, will be indistinguishable from the 1st person content of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the consiousness.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, OK so far.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Now, you might point out that it is obvious that the binary strings are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;members of the mathematical tautologies and thus have a &quot;timeless&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ontological status. I would agree with that completely, but I would point 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;out that the notion of a UTM or UD does not have the same timeless status 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because it requires that there be some kind of physical process and memory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;traces/tapes/chicken scratchings/etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Additionally, unless we have some kind of observer, even if it is a UTM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or UD itself, that can be interogated via some kind of physical interface 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by some other observer, it is logically impossible to claim that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness exists. Such would be equivalent to wondering whether of not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some black box where capable of emulating a conscious experience without 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;allowing any form of interface with the black box! The &quot;Yes Doctor&quot; idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;requires that the consciousness that is transfered from a biological brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to silicon be capable of reporting its 1st person states otherwise our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;claims are reduced to mere speculations. For example see the discussion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Zombies.
</em><br />
<br />OK, I agree. AI research is an experimental science. It may or may not be 
<br />
possible to build and program a computer so that it behaves like an 
<br />
intelligent and self-aware entity. Even if this difficult feat is eventually 
<br />
accomplished, there will then be the philosophical questions casting doubt 
<br />
on whether it is *really* conscious. This is the old problem of possibility 
<br />
of knowing whether other people really have minds like us, or whether they 
<br />
are just zombies acting like conscious beings. Ultimately, and regretfully, 
<br />
we can only be sure that we ourselves are conscious, and we have to take the 
<br />
existence of other minds on faith. However, if we believe that other humans 
<br />
are conscious because they seem to behave like we do, but refuse to believe 
<br />
that a computer which behaves in the same way (i.e. passes the Turing test) 
<br />
is conscious, then we are being inconsistent, and it is this inconsistency 
<br />
which I have called biological chauvinism.
<br />
<br />Having said that, it was not the purpose of my original post to show that 
<br />
observer-moments are Turing emulable. Rather, it was to show that Bruno 
<br />
Marchal's UDA can work without explicitly defining or explaining 
<br />
consciousness. I believe Bruno himself has aknowledged that the 
<br />
computational hypothesis (which he calls &quot;comp&quot;) may ultimately have to be 
<br />
taken as a matter of faith. This sort of bothers me because I spent a large 
<br />
part of my adolescence heaping scorn on religion and other faith-based 
<br />
belief systems, but I can't do anything about it.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;This is a wonderfully clear explanation of Bruno's UDA. Perhaps Bruno 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;could confirm that it is what he intended.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;As for the observer - or more fundamentally, the observer-moment - I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;you can get away without explicitly defining it. All you need is two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;assumptions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Firstly, you have to assume that observer-moments exist. I think it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;pretty clear that this is the case; you know it and I know it. You may not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;know how to explain it, define it, or even describe it, but you definitely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;know that observer-moments exist if you are a conscious being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Secondly, you have to assume that this mysterious consciousness thing is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;Turing emulable&quot;. It is not nearly as obvious that this second assumption 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;is true, and biological chauvinists may continue to deny it no matter what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;progress AI research may make. At some point, as Bruno says, you may have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to take &quot;comp&quot; on faith; for example, say &quot;yes doctor&quot; to the offer of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;durable new electronic brain when yours is starting to break down.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It should now be clear that if both of the above assumptions are true, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;then the UD should generate all the observer-moments as per Bruno and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Brian. The &quot;observer&quot; is then a derivative entity, made up of certain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;subsets of observer-moments. You know what an observer-moment is through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;direct experience, but you have nowhere been forced to explicitly define 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;it. If you want to say that consciousness is something utterly mysterious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;forever, you can say this, and the UDA still holds.
