Hi Stephen;
<br />
<br />Once again thanks for your comprehensive reply, Ive got a reply for one bit 
<br />
of it so far:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Does a &quot;history&quot;&quot; include values that can be associated with either of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; McTaggart's A or B series?'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is a strong argument to suppose it can be. The B series seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;carry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all the information needed to judge truth conditions of reflexive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; such as 'event E is past' (from the A Series). The statement is true so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as it is occurs after event E. A B Series can then at least take a part 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; our conception of a history.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;Seems&quot; is a very big caveat of a word! We have to be careful about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the assumptions that we &gt;bring to the table.  Your statement here seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be consistent with what I am trying to explain, &gt;I do not understand the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reason why you do not follow this point! Are you trying to argue for local 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;realism without meaning to?
</em><br />
<br />I think im arguing for caution about McTaggart. I am trying really hard to 
<br />
argue for perhaps even more than local realism. I want the moving present, 
<br />
which we can not break free of, to be right at the center of our concept of 
<br />
time. I want the past to not exist, and I want the future to not exist yet.
<br />
<br />A (3+1) D block universe is comparable to a McTaggart B series. However, B 
<br />
series presuppose time! They are defined as temporal sequences. As events in 
<br />
'before/after' order. They are derivable only, as far as I can see, by 
<br />
combining McTaggart C series - say real numbers, numbers that have a 
<br />
correspondence with points on an infinate line (which musnt be thought of 
<br />
temporally), with his A series (tensed facts: &quot;event e is past&quot;). A+C=B. So, 
<br />
A series (tensed facts or temporal token reflexives) are prior to B series 
<br />
(temporally sequenced series) just because they are used in the derivation 
<br />
of B series.
<br />
<br />McTaggart thinks this because he adopts as a premise the idea that change is 
<br />
necessary to time, and that a B-Series can not account for change only the A 
<br />
series can. The A Series embodies the 'moving present' he thinks, events are 
<br />
ordered as future, present and past. It is by associating this moving 
<br />
present with a C Series that he thinks a B Series can be derived. (note, 
<br />
that according to Kant time and space are a priori intuitions, back drops in 
<br />
which objects and events can sit. Following Kant we needn’t really agree 
<br />
with McTaggart about change. imho).
<br />
<br />However, as he points out, A series are defined in a circular way. An A 
<br />
series event can be future, past AND present. To say that event e is future 
<br />
also present and also past is just contradictory.
<br />
<br />The obvious complaint to McTaggart at this point in the argument is that 
<br />
event e is not future, past and present all at once. Event e is the future, 
<br />
will become the present and then become the past. Event e is not all those 
<br />
things (here it comes) at the same time!
<br />
<br />In order to overcome the inherent contradictions in the A-series, an A 
<br />
series has had to be invoked again, a meta A series if you like, and notice 
<br />
that this second invocation is subject to exactly the same criticism as 
<br />
before. We have a Meta e (Me) at which e is future, an Me at which e is 
<br />
present, an Me when e is past. A series now of temporally flowing meta es, 
<br />
each one of which are (at some time!!!) future, present or past. Clearly, 
<br />
the A series is obscuring our concept of time rather than elucidating it, 
<br />
and given the B Series is just (A+C) it can not make any sense either.
<br />
<br />Again, at this stage the illusory nature of the 'subjective time' is winning 
<br />
the argument. Having discarded the A Series as incoherent, and therefore the 
<br />
B series too because it is derived from the A series, the only thing we have 
<br />
left is the C-Series. Something we may metaphorically illustrate by real 
<br />
numbers, numbers that have a correspondence with points on an infinite line 
<br />
(which mustn’t be thought of temporally). Time then does not exist, but is 
<br />
properly concieved of as a dimenstion.
<br />
<br />Note, that it doesn’t follow from incoherence in the idea of a B Series, it 
<br />
follows from 1) regarding change as necessary to time, and 2) the A Series 
<br />
as more fundamental to the others (given it accounts for change).
<br />
<br />I want 'now' to be the fundamental concept in any theory of time. Not just 
<br />
subjective time, but real objective time. I don’t think appeals to token 
<br />
reflexives being more fundamental than before/after, or the necessity of 
<br />
change to time manage to establish the priority of the moving present over 
<br />
bloc universes, or C Lists such as real numbers.
<br />
<br />Thats why I make an appeal to something more intuitive. The A List as 
<br />
concieved by McTaggart may lead to incoherence, but nevertheless, we are 
<br />
embedded in the present. To meddle with its order is to conjure up paradox. 
<br />
Reality can not be like that.
<br />
<br /><br />Best Regards;
<br />
<br />Chris. :)

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hi Stephen;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I suppose we can think of time as a dimension. However, there are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provisos.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Did you happen to note that my post argued that the idea that &quot;time is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a dimension&quot; can only be taken as true in an a posteriori sense? It is when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we try to force the entirety of our notions relating to time to fit into 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the mold of an a priori given ordering of events that things run awry.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     How familiar are you with the details of quantum mechanics? Did you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happen to know that the notion of an observable in QM has a complex value 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that a real value only obtains after the multiplication of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observable with its complex conjugate? This operation of conjugation must 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;involve the selection of some basis.. This makes the problem of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pre-existing Real value time to be, at least, doubly difficult.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Complex numbers have no natural ordering, as opposed to the Reals, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which do, because in general, complex numbers do not commute with each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other. Only the very special subset of observables can be said to commute 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and thus can be mapped to some notion of a &quot;dimension&quot; that one can have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;translational transforms as functions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     In order to have coherent ideas like &quot;time travel&quot;, a moving &quot;now&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like some flash-light beam that can be moved forwards and backwards, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;require such contorted mathematics that one can hardly argue that that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how Nature works.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Time is not like x, y, or z in so far as we have no ability to freely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; navigate the axis in any direction we choose. We are embedded in time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moves onwards in a single direction without anyone's consent. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Furthermore,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where it possible to move around in time all sorts of paradoxes would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to ensue that just don't when I traverse the spatial dimensions. I'd 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appeal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to an asymmetry between time and space, it is a dimension of sorts, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; one that can conceptually swapped with a spatial dimension easily. I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think the a priori requirements for space will be necessarily the same 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; those for time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     All we seem to be able to control about time is its rate; we do this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by accelerating things or, equivalently, changing their position with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;respect to gravitational gradients. On the other hand, the notion of &quot;free 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will&quot; - which some argue is purely an illusion- implies the ability to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simultaneously consider some set of possible optional &quot;nows&quot; and chose one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as the &quot;next&quot;. This is the locus of conflict between the determinism of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;classical world and QM where it is said that God(s) play with Dice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     How familiar are you with the nuances of Special and General 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Relativity? I am hardly proficient with the mathematics, but the big 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;picture is very familiar to me - something to do with how a dyslexic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thinks. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Therefore, whilst our prior notions of space might be fairly complex, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seems to me that our a priori notion of time is in fact very simple. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just the notion of succession. That time exists if there is a successor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; event to this event. I can imagine a succession of events that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; repetitions of one another, and whilst I can agree that duration would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be measurable, that time might not be noticed, our a priori notion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is not contradicted despite that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The problem is that there can be no single unique &quot;succession of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events&quot;! This is the point that I am trying to explain to you! Because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observables obey such Principles as Heisenberg's Uncertainty, there can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to single a priori order of events that we can label with ever-larger Real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;numbers, starting at some Big Bang singularity point as our Zero. It is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simply a mental picture that we carry around with us, part of our memories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of precious events, all of the information of which is always and only in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;our &quot;present moment&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     BTW, this is something that the discussion of Observer Moments seems 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to be ignoring! A coherent notion of an OM must include some explanation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how one OM includes information about other OMs, which are its &quot;history&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;within it. Is there some upper bound on the amount of information that any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;single OM can contain?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'What is a &quot;clock&quot; if not an means to measure change?'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A clock changes in order to measure time. Change is the measure of time, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is not necessary for time to occur. Changes do not occur just because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; passes. Change is just necessary for measurement. I agree that time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;carries
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with it the possibility of change, but that is not the same. It cannot 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; both necessary and just possible, and the notion of change being a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possibility entails that there is no contradiction in the notion of time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; which there is no change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     No, sorry. That is wrong. Time is a meaningless notion absent the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;prior notion of change. This makes change priori ontologically to Time. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When I state that Time is a measure of change, I am speaking generically. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We obtain measures of the duration of some change by comparison to some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other duration of change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     An old fashioned clock does this by mapping the revolutions of clock 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hands to the passage of the sun over head, just to pick out one of many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interwoven mappings going on. ;-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Your comment that there is a relationship between the &quot;possibility of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change&quot; and time is on the right track, but again, there are many cases of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;changes that are fixed points. The apparent static Sun Dial vane's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intransigence as the sun moves over heard being one; but look at the metal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;making up that vane with a powerful microscope and one sees nothing even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;close to a static system. As Lee Smolin wrote in his book &quot;Three Roads of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Quantum Gravity&quot;, pg. 53:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;The idea of a state in Newtonian physics shares with classical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sculpture and painting the illusion of the frozen moment. This gives rise 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the illusion that the world is composed of objects. If this where really 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the way the world is, then the primary description of something would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how it is, and change in it would be secondary. Change would be nothing but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alterations of how something is. But relativity and quantum theory each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tell us that this is not how the world is. They tell us - no, better, they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;scream at us - that our world is a history of process. Motion and change 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are primary. Nothing is, except in a very approximate and temporary sense. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How something is, or what its state is, is an illusion. It may be a useful 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;illusion for some purposes, but if we want to think fundamentally we must 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not loose sight of the essential fact that 'is' is an illusion.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It is ironic to me that Lee Smolin has had a very hard time following 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;his own sage advice in his theoretics, for example see:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/smolin/smolin_p2.html">http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/smolin/smolin_p2.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The best solution that I have found is here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.kitada.com/timeV.html">http://www.kitada.com/timeV.html</a>

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As to how we extract notions of transitivity from series of events, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; imagine it similar to how we extract notions of causation from sets of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; constant conjunctions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Chris, the notion of a &quot;series&quot; has some kind of &quot;greater than&quot; or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;less than&quot; relation built in, or else it would not be a &quot;Series&quot;. If we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;want to talk about collections of events, points, etc. that don't include 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;transitive orderings in their defining algebra, we use sets, classes, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;categories, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Set of constant conjunctions can be mapped to notions of causality, of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;course, that is because their include in their construction (the defining 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;algebra) the property of Associativity and Commutativity.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     As I am trying to explain, if we are going to be faithful to the real 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world and the theories that fit it best, we must never ever assume that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;events that make up out world of experience are associative and commutative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with each other, except in very special situations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Does a &quot;history&quot;&quot; include values that can be associated with either of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; McTaggart's A or B series?'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There is a strong argument to suppose it can be. The B series seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;carry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all the information needed to judge truth conditions of reflexive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; such as 'event E is past' (from the A Series). The statement is true so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as it is occurs after event E. A B Series can then at least take a part 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; our conception of a history.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;Seems&quot; is a very big caveat of a word! We have to be careful about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the assumptions that we bring to the table.  Your statement here seems to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be consistent with what I am trying to explain, I do not understand the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reason why you do not follow this point! Are you trying to argue for local 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;realism without meaning to?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What is needed is a sense of 'now'. A change of time rather than a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time, a succession of events. So temporal becoming has to be invoked 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somehow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; - but also, it shouldn't be identified with conscious experience, there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no requirement for transitivity 'within the frame' so to speak. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;danger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with associating temporal becoming with our personal experience of time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that it is this that appears to deny time. To conclude that our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of time is somehow fundamental to time itself, is to deny time exists 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there is no observation of it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     We do indeed already have a &quot;sense of now&quot;! What we need is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explanation for why we can't avoid &quot;being in it&quot; and why the heck do its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;contents keep changing?!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The lack of transitivity &quot;within the frame&quot;, is very important to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;notice! There are experiments showing that our conscious experience spans a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;duration of up to 1/2 of a second, there is some anecdotal evidence of very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;long&quot; present moment &quot;windows&quot; of in-transitivity. Anyone that composes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;music might has an idea of what I am talking about here...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     But this &quot;within the frame&quot; window idea may be an artifact of how our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brains work and not have any relevance to physics in general, but I remain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;agnostic about this idea.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Are you not open to the charge you are levelling at others? Are you not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; least partially a time denier?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Oh no, I am not a time denier. I am arguing that Change, no, Becoming, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is a Fundamental aspect of Existence and not Static &quot;Being&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am, with Prof. Kitada, claiming that time is purely a &quot;local&quot; notion 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that there is no &quot;universal time&quot; other that what obtains from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;synchronizations of &quot;local times&quot;.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I accept that in  a sense we always imagine time from a temporal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; perspective, that we can not leap out of the temporal view so to speak, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whether that should lead to a conclusion that makes experience of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental is not so clear.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Ok, then notice that I am claiming that Change, not time (its local 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure), is fundamental.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [CP]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I prefer to think that temporal becoming is in some way an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; property of time. I think of it as conceived by Aristotle, as the now 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; stays the same, as 'what is now' changes. We experience time as we do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; future past and present, because of the way time in fact is. Where I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computational models might break down regards what process they invoke 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; run the B series in order to stamp each event with future, now and past, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; what is their incarnation of 'now' - and whether the adoption of such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; process involves a pernicious infinite regress.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The pernicious regress only follows from the assumption that changes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are some monolithic and universal monotonic aspect of the world. You might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enjoy reading Barwise and Seligman's &quot;Information Flow&quot; - all kinds of neat 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(consistent!) uses of circularity and regress. Drop the assumption of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;well-foundedness!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Try this idea: We do NOT exist in a single space-time manifold. That 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure is a collective illusion - but still a &quot;reality&quot;- that results 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from the coincidental synchrony of our individual observables. We -in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ourselves, are not &quot;classical&quot; entities, we are quantum. It is our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observations that are classical. This is the lesson that Everett discovered 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;within QM and people have for the most part not yet understood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Kindest regards,
