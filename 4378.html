<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability of experiencing a ''personal history'' x, by integrating

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over all possible histories X of the multiverse that are consistent with x.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Within this framework there is no room for quantum suicide to work.
</em><br />
<br />This has been discussed at length in the past on this list, without much
<br />
resolution.  You might want to clarify what you mean by quantum suicide
<br />
&quot;working&quot;.  What do you hope to accomplish via QS?  What effect will it
<br />
have on your subjective perceptions?
<br />
<br />I think we all agree with the objective consequences of QS.  Someone kills
<br />
themself in some branch of the multiverse.  They are removed from that
<br />
branch but continue to live on in others.  The disagreements begin when
<br />
we consider the subjective effects.
<br />
<br />The most limited view, I think, is that QS will subjectively fail.
<br />
That is, if you attempt to kill yourself in some clean way, the machine
<br />
will work in some universes and fail in others, but you will only notice
<br />
the result in those universes (or branches of the MWI) where it fails.
<br />
<br />In single-universe models, we would predict that a highly reliable
<br />
QS machine will simply terminate your existence.  You won't perceive
<br />
anything, after it goes off.  In multiverse models, a QS believer would
<br />
predict that you will continue to exist even after the machine goes
<br />
off.  Your measure will be reduced, but your existence will continue.
<br />
This is the most limited and restricted prediction with regard to QS in
<br />
a multiverse.
<br />
<br />(With some assumptions, you could get the same prediction of continued
<br />
existence in a single-universe model.  If we assume that the universe
<br />
is infinite in extent so there are multiple copies of you, or that some
<br />
future civilization will simulate your mind perfectly, then this could be
<br />
a mechanism for your existence to continue subjectively even after the QS
<br />
machine goes off.  But in a finite and &quot;small&quot; single-universe model with
<br />
limited future computing capacity, then a QS death is final and complete.)
<br />
<br />A more ambitious version of QS attempts to change and hopefully improve
<br />
your circumstances by pruning those branches where bad things happen.
<br />
By doing this, your total measure is reduced, but your average happiness
<br />
(averaged over all instances of yourself) is increased.  Because your
<br />
total measure is reduced, your total happiness is decreased (unless
<br />
you only use QS to eliminate branches where your happiness is negative,
<br />
that is, where you are better off dead).  So there is a tradeoff between
<br />
increasing your average happiness while decreasing your total happiness.
<br />
I believe it is a matter of personal preference which one is better, so I
<br />
think on this basis that QS is right for some people and wrong for others.
<br />
<br />Another ambitious flavor of QS predicts that we can distinguish multiverse
<br />
from single-universe realities by attempting QS.  It is even possible
<br />
that all versions of death fail just like QS would, hence that everyone
<br />
who has ever lived has experienced subjective immortality, if multiverse
<br />
theories are true.  By this reasoning, each person will eventually become
<br />
subjectively convinced of multiverse theories (if they deduce that this
<br />
is the explanation for their bizarrely extended lifespans).
