The inaccuracy of the paranthesis-statement. There is more to be learned
<br />
(discovered, experienced, adding to our knowledge-base) than those
<br />
observations and their explanations we usually call 'physics' or any other
<br />
name. Your word &quot;ultimately&quot; points to this concern very decently. You
<br />
have the right to call the 'ultimate' (never attainable?) epistemic
<br />
cognitive
<br />
inventory &quot;PHYSICS&quot; (based on the origin of this word), but most people
<br />
will take it as the limited subject in ongoing college curricula.
<br />
&lt;St&gt;:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Certainly, when I make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision it doesn't *feel* as if I am bound by any absolute deterministic

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules, nor does it feel as if I am being driven by a random number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generator. But if I think about it seriously, it is clear that this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what must actually be happening.&lt;
</em><br />
[JM]:
<br />
I deny the 'random number generator' part, but I agree with your point that
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;what I feel&quot; is irrelevant. There are unconscious motives in the mindset.
<br />
There are 'hidden' variables and 'not yet discovered' inputs, we cannot give
<br />
full account of all that is going on in our mind (incl. decisions?).
<br />
The 'random' IMO comes from the unkown part of the world, just as the
<br />
&quot;chaotic&quot;, once our epistemic enrichment discloses those &quot;rules?&quot; (parts)
<br />
that explain the process leading to either random or chaotic, they cease to
<br />
be such and are included in the orderly and understandable.
<br />
<br />In your reply to Russell you wrote:
<br />
&lt;St&gt;:
<br />
.... it seems to me that in the brain both types of &quot;random&quot; event would
<br />
combine to give a very complex and unpredictable picture indeed: quantum
<br />
events at the atomic or subatomic scale would be amplified by chaotic
<br />
interactions at the classical scale. However, I have seen it stated that
<br />
quantum events would in fact not be significant at the scale of neuronal
<br />
processes. Which is correct? And does it really make much difference,
<br />
whether we are talking truly random or intractably pseudo-random?
<br />
[JM]:
<br />
Your doubts are well taken. The stage, when some 'model-views' led to the
<br />
QM-based considerations, includes no indications that there is nothing else.
<br />
In fact, the missing transition between &quot;physical measurements&quot; vs  (true?)
<br />
ORIGINATION of mental content (NOT the correlations between such
<br />
&nbsp;occurrencies!)  postulates the 'more significant' factors you are missing.
<br />
We
<br />
are talking in our limited models and their explanations, based on levels of
<br />
(epistemic) information which during the eras when our scientific concepts
<br />
were developed was by far not sufficient to understand e.g. mentality. It
<br />
is still not sufficient and this calls for considerations of randomness,
<br />
chaos,
<br />
indeterministic and emergent marvels. (Religions included).
<br />
The unpredicatbility stems from the total interaction of factors not only so
<br />
far unaccountable, but a (potential) full combination of the unlimited 'all'
<br />
is
<br />
exceeding our mental capabilities.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The question of (in)determinacy within our judgement is model-related. A

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;...&quot;free will&quot; to refer to conscious entities making indeterminate

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;choices...&quot; is as well the judgement of reasonability in our limited

views.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;There may be (hidden? undiscovered?) 'reasons' that make us choose a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(seemingly) &quot;unreasonable&quot; decision.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;To Statis' question I don't pretend to have &quot;The Answer&quot;, :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;...Can someone please explain how I can tell when I am exercising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;*genuine* free will, as opposed to this pseudo-free variety, which
</em><br />
clearly
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I have no control over?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  but a consideration may go like this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;our mind is interrelated to the rest of the totality (wholeness) and
</em><br />
stores
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;individually different mindsets as a result of memory and ideation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(genetically + personal history-wise modified).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The 'mind' (what is it? self, memories, etc., I say: the mental ASPECT of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;our complexity)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is not a sole function of the brain-tissues which are only the tools
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;working WITH it.  There is no 'mystery' in this statement: only our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;ignorance preventing to discover things beyond our present models by our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;physical and physiological observational (and explanatory) skills.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;At the level of complexness in our mind-state we have choices. Not
</em><br />
freely,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;but definitely 'ways' to compare and choose. &quot;We are free&quot; means we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;choose the route that fits most the combined image of our mental state at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the moment. We are &quot;free&quot; to choose otherwise, again, deterministically
</em><br />
by
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the background(s) we consciously know or don't. No matter if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;it looks 'reasonable' for others, ot not. Statis is right to feel not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;responsible for such choices - only religions impart such guilt-feeling
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;keep the flock under control.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Since the actions are deemed (in)deterministic in both 'conscious(?)' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;'inanimate(?)' units, it points to our ignorance about the functional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;originations for them. The unlimited interconnections with their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;differential efficiency on the different targets that makes the wholistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;interconnection of the totality incalculable (not prone to Turing-Chuch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;application) gives us the feeling of a free will, of indeterminacy,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;earlier: of a miracle and awe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I don't want to even guess how much we did not yet discover.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just to clarify, my request for a method to distinguish &quot;genuine&quot; free
</em><br />
will
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the &quot;pseudo-free&quot; variety (deterministic or random) was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tongue-in-cheek. A person's decisions and actions must either follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministically from a set of rules (which at bottom must reduce to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws of physics, whatever these ultimately turn out to be), or else they

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must be random; what other possibility is there? Certainly, when I make a
