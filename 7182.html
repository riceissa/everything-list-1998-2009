<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Isn't it possible that decision processes of the brain, hence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness, DOES depend critically on quantum states?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, it's possible.  There is a school of thought which advances this
<br />
position.  Penrose, Hamerhoff are a couple of the names, off the top
<br />
of my head.  There is an extensive literature on the subject to which you
<br />
could find some entries via Google.  I just did so and found archives
<br />
of a mailing list called QUANTUM-MIND which is all about this subject.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless I think it is safe to say that the opposite opinion
<br />
is more widespread, that the mind does not depend critically on any
<br />
quantum property.  One of the main reasons is that quantum coherence
<br />
is very difficult to maintain outside of carefully prepared laboratory
<br />
conditions.  Another point is that our models of neurons do not require
<br />
quantum behavior, yet computer simulations suggest that they can learn
<br />
patterns and respond in meaningful ways similar to actual neural tissue.
<br />
Of course we are far from being able to simulate anything at the level
<br />
of consciousness, but so far there is nothing observable about neural
<br />
behavior that suggests nonclassical effects.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     My understanding of the workings of the brain is that my action, whether 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought or deed, is determined by whether or not certain neurons fire.  This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depends on many other neurons.  So the brain can be in a state of delicate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; balance, where it could be impossible to predict whether or not the neuron 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fires.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     We all have to make decisions where the pluses apparently equal the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minuses.  It would take very little to tip the balance one way or the other. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps, at the deepest level, the route we take depends on whether an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electron has left or right polarization, or some other quantum property - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which we agree can't be measured.
</em><br />
<br />I think it is doubtful that neurons often get into a condition where
<br />
they are so delicately balanced that a single electron could make a
<br />
difference.  There are a lot of electrons in a neuron!  But even if it
<br />
did happen, it wouldn't mean that the neuron *depends* on this effect.
<br />
A simulation of a brain that was non-quantum might not behave 100% the
<br />
same as the real brain being modelled, but it would probably work ok.
<br />
By their nature, brains need to be robust and immune to disturbances.
<br />
Neurons are constantly dying, their internals assaulted by changes in
<br />
blood chemistry, but the brain keeps chugging away.  It's not exactly
<br />
a delicate flower.  Again, this is exactly the opposite of the quantum
<br />
behavior we observe in the lab, which is extremely sensitive and gets
<br />
messed up if you look at it funny.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     If this is true, then perhaps Free Will (or at least behavior that is, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in principle, unpredictable) does exist.
</em><br />
<br />Right, well, for many people, being at the mercy of unpredictable and
<br />
uncontrollable randomness may be free but it's hardly willful.
<br />
