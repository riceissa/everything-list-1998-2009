<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recent interest in a concept known as &quot;relaxed selection&quot;, which stems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from an observation that biological evolution is at its most creative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after a mass extinction event. The idea being that the mass extinction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; removes a lot of competition between species, and hence &quot;relaxes&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; selection pressure. I have been trying out some relaxed selection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes in my artificial life experiments, although admittedly  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; success so far.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To sum up with the old aphorism &quot;keep an open mind, but not so open
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your brains fall out&quot;. But means are needed to &quot;relax the selection&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from time to time, to get us out of the Kuhnian paradigm shift
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; treadmill. There are techniques that can be taught (just like one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; teach critical thinking tools, such as logic and deduction), and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think this is what Kim is saying. But true creativity cannot be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taught
</em><br />
<br /><br />If you are right then we are doomed because creative thinking is the  
<br />
only shot left in the locker for humans. More of the same will no  
<br />
longer get us far. Analysis and judgement are not enough when there is  
<br />
a need to design a way forward. Let's please not deify creativity. It  
<br />
can be taught. Where do people get the notion that it cannot? de Bono  
<br />
and all the spinoffs of his methods have been teaching creativity  
<br />
since the 70s. These are the people who have a grip on the idea of the  
<br />
mind as an entity that can be understood as a system with a defined  
<br />
behaviour. Whether it turns out to be 'true creativity' or just plain  
<br />
old every day fake creativity, it's a step in the right direction to  
<br />
teach creativity based on the new understanding of the brain. It puts  
<br />
the other wheels on the car that Socrates sold with only the front  
<br />
left passenger wheel (critical thinking)! It is unfortunately a blind- 
<br />
spot of many people: this &quot;metaphysicalisation&quot; of creativity which  
<br />
puts it out of the reach of ordinary mortals. Who can touch and/or  
<br />
teach creativity then? Its nonsense - everyone can access creativity  
<br />
once they know how the mind works. Does the substitution level fall  
<br />
above or below the level of creativity?
<br />
<br />The thinking system we use was designed on language, not on an  
<br />
understanding of how the brain works. Thankfully in putting across  
<br />
your ideas about comp you have your numerical symbology to help you  
<br />
out, because without it we'd all be stuffed here. Language is a museum  
<br />
of ignorance, in a sense. Every word and every concept has entered  
<br />
language at a stage of relative ignorance compared to our present,  
<br />
greater experience. But the words and concepts are frozen into  
<br />
permanence by language and we must use these words and concepts to  
<br />
deal with present-day reality. This means that we may be forced to  
<br />
look at things in a very inadequate way.
<br />
<br />Creativity and humour are phenomena that arise naturally in active  
<br />
self-organising information systems. They cannot arise in passive  
<br />
systems, systems that depend on an external agent to organise the  
<br />
information. That is why traditional philosophers, psychologists and  
<br />
information scientists have had to ignore humour - humour cannot occur  
<br />
in passive information systems. Creativity and lateral thinking have  
<br />
exactly the same basis in the mind as humour. They provide the much- 
<br />
needed discontinuity that causes the snap of pattern-switching,  
<br />
absolutely essential for the mind to be released to see things it  
<br />
previously could not.
<br />
<br /><br />It is precisely because the brain is naturally uncreative that the  
<br />
need for artificial tools for introducing discontinuity arises. &quot;Po&quot;  
<br />
stands for &quot;provocation follows&quot;
<br />
<br />PO: the factory should be downstream of itself
<br />
<br />highly illogical thought but leads to the idea that the factory's  
<br />
input should perhaps be located downstream of its own output. Like  
<br />
this it would be directly concerned by input quality and purity. Some  
<br />
countries have legislated for this to be the case.
<br />
<br /><br />Our traditional view of the brain has made creativity a mystery and  
<br />
completely impossible to understand. Every valuable creative idea must  
<br />
of course be logical in hindsight (otherwise we could not appreciate  
<br />
the idea) so we have assumed that better logic would have reached the  
<br />
idea in the first place. That view is now best understood to be  
<br />
garbage. An understanding of the brain as a patterning, self- 
<br />
organising active online information system with pattern assymetries  
<br />
(the path from A to B is very much longer than the path from B to A)  
<br />
provides the logical basis for provocation, random entry, reversal,  
<br />
fractionation, concept fanning and other deliberately artificial  
<br />
Lateral Thinking tools.
<br />
<br />These things have succeeded brilliantly in the business world and made  
<br />
their author a lot of money. The thinking tools of de Bono can be  
<br />
taught to Nobel Laureates or to 5 year olds in third world villages.  
<br />
He has spawned an army of imitators. Academics and educators hate de  
<br />
Bono because he makes no reference whatever to any existing literature  
<br />
in the field. His pages are completely free of footnotes.
<br />
<br />cheers,
