Hi all -
<br />
<br />nice to be here. I'm probably going to mostly lurk, but a brief
<br />
introduction can't hurt, I guess.
<br />
<br />BACKGROUND: 28 y/o, CS/media. Tech writer &amp; freelance developer.
<br />
Lately become fairly involved in a number of NGOs, notably Wikimedia
<br />
Foundation (home of Wikipedia) &amp; Open Progress (an open source / open
<br />
knowledge think tank). I've written a book called &quot;Die heimliche
<br />
Medienrevolution&quot; (&quot;the secret media revolution&quot;) which describes the
<br />
global media changes that have begun to emerge with the Internet.
<br />
<br />I'm helping to develop a collaborative, multilingual structured
<br />
ontology engine at omegawiki.org , which has a multilingual dictionary/
<br />
thesaurus as its first application, though we also have working
<br />
imports of scientific ontologies. I question modern thinking on
<br />
sexuality, which I believe is still in continuity with monotheistic
<br />
doctrine; I run a website at violence.de which presents some little
<br />
known research on the topic of touch &amp; sexuality. I believe
<br />
&quot;Intellectual Property&quot; must be largely eliminated, and I'm also
<br />
highly interested in enabling a new economy of knowledge which does
<br />
not require IP, but uses distributed funding models instead. I
<br />
strongly promote Free Culture &amp; Open Access wherever I go. :-)
<br />
<br />INTEREST: Increasingly fascinated with emergence, as far as I can
<br />
understand it. I'm a slow learner, but like to believe that random
<br />
rules evolving under a meta-rule can be used to emerge all the
<br />
complexity of a multiverse, and am interested in what smarter people
<br />
than me have to say about that. I also wonder about the definition of
<br />
&quot;intelligence&quot; as it is used in everyday life, as opposed to what I
<br />
perceive as clearly intelligent patterns e.g. in biological evolution;
<br />
I think intelligence needs to be redefined as a process that does not
<br />
require a &quot;subject&quot; as such to occur. That is, I do believe in
<br />
&quot;intelligent design,&quot; but without a designer, and instead of
<br />
&quot;irreducible complexity&quot;, &quot;fully reducible complexity.&quot; ;-)
<br />
<br />I'm an absolute amateur here, but fear not; the thing that
<br />
distinguishes me from the average crackpot is that I do know that I
<br />
know very little. The above is just a very tentative state of thinking
<br />
which is flagged in my brain as &quot;needs extensive review &amp; discussion.&quot;
<br />
I'm here to learn, over a period of years if necessary, to get at
<br />
least a basic view of the state of thinking on these subjects.  I have
<br />
no delusions of grandeur -- my only hope to make any &quot;original&quot;
<br />
contribution is to perhaps be able to help communicate some of the
<br />
ideas of this group to a larger audience, as I feel they could be
<br />
highly relevant to the view that we have on the multiverse and our own
<br />
role therein.
<br />
<br />I do believe, and I think there is reason to do so, that Darwinian
<br />
evolutionary thought has opened up a new chapter in our perception of
<br />
ourselves and our species, but this chapter is not yet complete. The
<br />
emergence of life on Earth is so utterly amazing that many refuse to
<br />
believe it. When we fully realize that this process is itself part of
<br />
a larger process of emergence, and become capable of describing (and
<br />
perhaps replicating) it, redefining ourselves becomes inescapable. We
<br />
are merely agents of emergence.
<br />
<br />Now here's a crackpot idea to throw into the mix, and then you can
<br />
start laughing: I do believe that this perception can become the basis
<br />
for a new kind of morality, an &quot;objective morality&quot;, where the
<br />
discovery of truth and the rational application thereof becomes the
<br />
only _objectively justifiable_ moral course that an agent of emergence
<br />
may take. Social behavior is &quot;merely&quot; utilitarian, but extremely
<br />
powerful at the same time; anti-social societies, or those which
<br />
tolerate anti-social behavior, are not sustainable. Historically,
<br />
people have looked to arbitrary rule systems for moral guidance; these
<br />
may be partially useful and partially harmful. My hope is that at
<br />
least a segment of society can evolve to follow a completely rational
<br />
rule system -- and that we may be at the brink of consensus about
<br />
this.
<br />
<br />To my credit (or not), most of these thoughts are my own (which I
<br />
haven't really shared before), and I'm only beginning to be influenced
<br />
by the seemingly endless number of publications on the topic. Since I
<br />
was a child, the idea of a &quot;finite&quot;, single universe has always seemed
<br />
bizarre to me, due to its arbitrary nature; the final &quot;Why?&quot; question
<br />
should not be answered with &quot;We don't know&quot; but &quot;Because there is no
<br />
other way for things _to be_, for the phrase 'to be' to make any
<br />
sense.&quot;
<br />
<br />If anyone wants to suggest a reading list, I'd be most appreciative.
<br />
If anything has been written in particular on the topics of objective
<br />
morality, or definition of &quot;intelligence&quot; in emergent systems, I'd be
<br />
very interested. Stuff I've already flagged for reading is
<br />
Schmidhuber's work (just trying to understand the conclusions -- no
<br />
hope of following in his footsteps) and Wolfram's, which I'll take
<br />
with the required block of salt. There's a number of pop sci books out
<br />
about emergence, but I don't know if they're any good. I just ordered
<br />
Vilenkin's &quot;Many Worlds in One&quot;.
<br />
<br />LAST BOOK I'VE READ: Ian Rowlands: Full Facts Book of Cold Reading. It
<br />
describes the technique used to make a person believe that you are
<br />
reading their mind. Self-published - you can't get it on Amazon;
<br />
written by a famous &quot;magician&quot;. A book that for me caused a minor
<br />
epiphany in understanding that the seemingly arbitrary actions of
<br />
psychics and gurus actually follow patterns that are well described in
<br />
the community of &quot;magicians&quot; and &quot;mentalists&quot;. Not only that, but some
<br />
literature even targets both groups; this is little known because the
<br />
literature of magicians and mentalists is only sold in special stores
<br />
or even only by special recommendation (though you can find much of it
<br />
on P2P networks these days). To me, this is the &quot;darker side of
<br />
magic&quot;, which is commonly only seen as simple entertainment. The book
<br />
also well illustrates the alterability of human memory (see also
<br />
literature on False Memory Syndrome). I believe with this final
<br />
connection, my understanding of religion is largely complete.
