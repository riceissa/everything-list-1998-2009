SOLUTIONS
<br />
<br /><br />OK. I give the solution of the exercises of the last session, on the  
<br />
cartesian product of sets.
<br />
<br />I recall the definition of the product A X B.
<br />
<br />A X B    =   {(x,y) such that x belongs to A and y belongs to B}
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;I gave A = {0, 1}, and B = {a, b}.
<br />
<br /><br />In this case, A X B = {(0,a), (0, b), (1, a), (1, b)}
<br />
<br />The  cartesian drawing is, for AXB :
<br />
<br /><br />a     (0, a)   (1, a)
<br />
<br />b     (0, b)  (1, b)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;00          1
<br />
<br /><br />Exercise: do the cartesian drawing for BXA.
<br />
<br />Solution:
<br />
<br />1     (a, 1)   (b, 1)
<br />
<br />0     (a, 0)  (b, 0)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a          b
<br />
<br />You see that B X A = {(a,0), (a,1), (b,0), (b, 1)}
<br />
<br />You should see that, not only A X B is different from B X A, but AXB  
<br />
and BXA have an empty intersection. They have no elements in common at  
<br />
all. But they do have the same cardinal 2x2 = 4.
<br />
<br />1)
<br />
Compute
<br />
{a, b, c} X {d, e} =
<br />
I show you a method (to minimize inattention errors):
<br />
<br />I wrote first {(a, _),  (b, _), (c, _), (a, _),  (b, _), (c, _)}  two  
<br />
times because I have seen that {d, e} has two elements.
<br />
Then I add the second elements of the couples, which comes from {d, e}:
<br />
<br />{(a, d),  (b, d), (c, d), (a, e),  (b, e), (c, e)}
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br /><br />{d, e} X {a, b, c} = {(d, a), (d, b), (d, c), (e, a), (e, b), (e, c)}
<br />
<br />{a, b} X {a, b} = {(a, a), (a, b), (b, a), (b, b)}
<br />
<br />{a, b} X { } = { }.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />2)
<br />
Convince yourself that the cardinal of AXB is the product of the
<br />
cardinal of A and the cardinal of B.
<br />
A and B are finite sets here. Hint: meditate on their cartesian drawing.
<br />
<br />Question? This should be obvious. No?
<br />
<br /><br />3) Draw a piece of NXN.    (with, as usual, N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}):
<br />
<br />.        .          .         .         .          .         .           .
<br />
.        .          .         .         .          .         .        .
<br />
.        .          .         .         .          .         .     .
<br />
5    (0,5)  (1,5)  (2,5)  (3,5)  (4,5)  (5,5)  ...
<br />
4    (0,4)  (1,4)  (2,4)  (3,4)  (4,4)  (5,4)  ...
<br />
3    (0,3)  (1,3)  (2,3)  (3,3)  (4,3)  (5,3)  ...
<br />
2    (0,2)  (1,2)  (2,2)  (3,2)  (4,2)  (5,2)  ...
<br />
1    (0,1)  (1,1)  (2,1)  (3,1)  (4,1)  (5,1)  ...
<br />
0    (0,0)  (1,0)  (2,0)  (3,0)  (4,0)  (5,0)  ...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0       01         02       03         04       05  ...
<br />
<br /><br />OK?
<br />
<br /><br />N is infinite, so N X N is infinite too.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at the diagonal: (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) ...
<br />
<br />definition: the diagonal of AXA, a product of a set with itself,  is  
<br />
the set of couples (x,y) with x = y.
<br />
<br />All right? No question? Such diagonal will have a quite important role  
<br />
in the sequel.
<br />
<br />Next: I will say one or two words on the notion of relation, and then  
<br />
we will define the most important notion ever discovered by the  
<br />
humans: the notion of function. Then, the definition of the  
<br />
exponentiation of sets, A^B, is very simple: it is the set of  
<br />
functions from B to A.
<br />
What is important will be to grasp the notion of function. Indeed, we  
<br />
will soon be interested in the notion of computable functions, which  
<br />
are mainly what computers, that is universal machine, compute. But  
<br />
even in physics, the notion of function is present everywhere. That  
<br />
notion capture the notion of dependency between (measurable)  
<br />
quantities. To say that the temperature of a body depends on the  
<br />
pressure on that body, is very well described by saying that the  
<br />
temperature of a body is a function of the pressure.
<br />
Most phenomena are described by relation, through equations, and most  
<br />
solution of those equation are functions. Functions are everywhere,  
<br />
somehow.
<br />
<br />I have some hesitation, though. Functions can be described as  
<br />
particular case of relations, and relations can be described as  
<br />
special case of functions. This happens many times in math, and can  
<br />
lead to bad pedagogical decisions, so I have to make a few thinking,  
<br />
before leading you to unnecessary complications.
<br />
<br />Please ask questions if *any*thing is unclear. I suggest the  
<br />
&quot;beginners&quot; in math take some time to invent exercises, and to solve  
<br />
them. Invent simple little sets, and compute their union,  
<br />
intersection, cartesian product, powerset.
<br />
You can compose exercises: for example: compute the cartesian product  
<br />
of the powerset of {0, 1} with the set {a}. It is not particularly  
<br />
funny, but it is like music. If you want to be able to play some music  
<br />
instrument, sometimes you have to &quot;faire ses gammes&quot;,we say in french;  
<br />
you know, playing repetitively annoying musical patterns, if only to  
<br />
teach your lips or fingers to do the right movement without thinking.  
<br />
Math needs also such a kind of practice, especially in the beginning.
<br />
Of course, as Kim said, passive understanding of music (listening)  
<br />
does not need such exercises. Passive understanding of math needs,  
<br />
alas, many &quot;simple&quot; exercises. Active understanding of math, needs  
<br />
difficult exercises up to open problems, but this is not the goal here.
<br />
