It looks like I might have timed out.  Hopefully this doesn't appear

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I believe the answer to the question, &quot;What is Truth?&quot; which Pilate asked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Jesus, was standing right in front of Pilate: Jesus himself.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hmmm.... Perhaps in some symbolical way.
</em><br />
<br />The &quot;crux&quot; is that he is not symbolic...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The Christian definition of truth goes back to the core of everything, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is personal.  As I've said before, without a personal core, the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;personal&quot; has lost its meaning.  In the context nowadays of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; impersonal-based philosophy, &quot;personal&quot; has come to &quot;mean&quot; something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like &quot;without rational basis&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course that *is* a pity. It is bad, for human, to develop such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;self-eliminating&quot; belief.  It is not rational either.
</em><br />
<br />I agree.  cf my examples (Skinner...) in response to Stathis.  But how
<br />
do *you* define rationality and persons?  You also seem to reduce it,
<br />
to numbers.  I think the sophistication of incompleteness simply hides
<br />
the fact that it is still a &quot;castle in the sky&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But when the personal IS the basis, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; an impersonal concept of personal, but the ultimate Person, and with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; man being made in the image of that ultimate Person, we have a basis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for truth, personality, rationality, good...
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you are emphasizing the &quot;third hypostase&quot; = the first person = the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ALL-SOUL = the universal knower. This is akin to David Lymann and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; George Levy. It is not incompatible with your view if you accept the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that we &quot;are all God(s)&quot;. Cf Alan Watts for example and most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mystical insight.
</em><br />
<br />I think later down you see that I am addressing all of the hypostases.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'll just deal with the first 4 hypostases, since this is the basis of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the rest, even though my John quote below addresses the others also.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Perhaps the neo-Platonists couldn't see how the core could be personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (even though Plato called it the &quot;Good&quot;). It is hard to accept that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; core could be both infinite and personal (and good), since our view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; personality is finite (and flawed). But the infinite personal core, God
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the Father, which replaces the neo-Platonist &quot;ONE&quot; or 0-person (of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; course I maintain that the replacing was in the other direction :)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It looks you seem really to be an Aristotelician ....
</em><br />
<br />By the &quot;direction&quot; of replacement I didn't mean chronologically, like
<br />
Plato replaces Aristotle.  I meant that the impersonal core replaced
<br />
the real personal core, independent of Aristotle's views.
<br />
You have said before that the Christians emphasize matter more than
<br />
mind, as opposed to the Platonists and neo-Platonists.  There may have
<br />
been a few Christians who reclaimed a belief in nature, like Thomas
<br />
Aquinas, when the mind/grace was being emphasized too much.  But, as
<br />
can be seen in the Christian &quot;interpretation&quot; of the Greek hypostases,
<br />
the core of Christianity, being rooted in the Hebrew God who is the
<br />
source of all things/persons, is really first of all a downward
<br />
emanation, like the neo-Platonists thought.   There can be no upward
<br />
emanation unless/until a sufficient downward emanation is provided.  In
<br />
Christianity, the downward emanation is &quot;God loves us&quot;, and then the
<br />
upward emanation is &quot;We love God&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In a way this is true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in that our earthly fathers/mothers and others take part as persons in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; developing us as persons.  But there has to be an ultimate source.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. To be a realist is to bet there is one, but from a scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (third person) pov, it is an open question as to know if such ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing is personal. Comp is going in the Plotinus direction where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ultimate reality is not personal.
</em><br />
<br />As you saw, I addressed the third person pov below.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; He (the Holy Spirit) fills in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the gaps when we cannot find words to talk to him.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like G* minus G does for any self-referentially classical machine. (The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lobian machine).
</em><br />
<br />Yes. By the way, you said to Brent that &quot;you&quot; know that you are lobian.
<br />
&nbsp;How do you know?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Then, the real clincher is the third person point of view, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neo-Platonist &quot;INTELLECT&quot;.  The personal God did not stay silent and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; keep all of this personhood stuff at a purely theoretical level which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we would have to take with blind faith.  Instead the hopes of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; neo-Platonists were fulfilled in the Christ (Messiah) whose name was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Emmanuel which means &quot;God with us&quot;, who was the &quot;wisdom and power of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God&quot;.  &quot;In the beginning was the Word (Logos), and the Word was with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; made. In him was life, and that life was the light of men. The light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it... The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can take this as a poetical description of the relation between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal modalities or the hypostases.
</em><br />
<br />This is not poetry.  Heidegger said to listen to the poet, not to the
<br />
content, but just to the fact that there is a poet, which gives us hope
<br />
that there is meaning.  However, unfulfilled hope does not provide
<br />
meaning.  The content of these words speak of the *actual* fulfillment
<br />
of the hopes of the Greeks expressed in their hypostases.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; We have seen his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; grace and truth.&quot; (John 3:1,2,3,14)  So the particular finite form that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we have, God somehow took on that same form.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This, on the other way, could be a comp sort of blasphemes. Comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;ethic&quot; could even makes God eliminating any creature so arrogant that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they take they their realities and images of God for granted. With
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp, if we are divine, we can only be divine *hypotheses*. We can hope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being God last word, but this is really something which depends on our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work and can never be taken for granted.
</em><br />
<br />It is the ultimate irony that Jesus was taken to be blaspheming when he
<br />
said he was &quot;one with the Father&quot; and &quot;before Abraham was, I AM&quot;, for
<br />
&quot;no one can say that they are God&quot;..... the mistake is the missing
<br />
phrase at the end: &quot;...except God&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In this way God showed us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (who are in his image) true truth about himself in a way which we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; understand (just as a father tells truth to his children), without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; having to tell us infinite exhaustive truth.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again this can have Plotinian sense. But there is a danger (for us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human) to take those assertions too much literally.
</em><br />
<br />Yes it is a mistake to say that we understand God fully, but it would
<br />
also be a mistake (would it not?), if God were to tell us something
<br />
true (but of course not exhaustive), for us to say that we do not know
<br />
the thing that he told us.  It is like (in fact IT IS) the relationship
<br />
between a father and a child.  (In fact, the earthly father/mother and
<br />
child relationship is a shadow/projection of the heavenly, rather than
<br />
the other way around.)  I agree that it is dangerous for a child to
<br />
keep taking a father too literally when the father tells him/her
<br />
something.  At first, the child should take the father/mother's words
<br />
at face value, trusting that the parent is saying the right words for
<br />
the child to understand what the parent wants them to know.  But to
<br />
keep living with only those words, and not continue to try to learn a
<br />
deeper understanding and grow through more communication and exchange
<br />
of love, would be to deny the true nature of what it means to be a
<br />
person.  Any time we stop because we think we have attained all of the
<br />
knowledge we need, that is when start to die.  I know you are saying a
<br />
similar thing.  But I am saying that as a person, we are always able to
<br />
look at any description or approximation, for instance described by G,
<br />
and say, &quot;I am more than that&quot;.  We are always able to change our
<br />
paradigm to a higher understanding.  This is the sense that I mean when
<br />
I say that, &quot;I am not a machine.&quot;  And this can be done only on the
<br />
basis of the ultimate infinite Person.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This bridges the gap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between the celestial/divine and the terrestial/human.  Christ is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fixed-point between heaven and earth, the axis of the universe for us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In Christ, we all see in third-person the Way, the Truth and the Life.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again if &quot;Christ&quot; denotes a symbolic value I can make sense of what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are saying, but in my opinion the relation between Christians and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christ are extremely fuzzy. There has been a lasting confusion of power
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which makes me skeptical. Too much propositions has been deformed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their authoritative institutionalization. Still today &quot;theology&quot; tends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be separated from science (i.e. from accepting doubts and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite number of attempts of clarity and rigor). This separation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resulted into the abandon of the fundamental questions to the fanatics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (who mocks clarity, rigor, and doubts).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now I am aware of the last century &quot;repentance&quot; of the Catholic Church,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including the necessity of restricting faith with rationality, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many open minded school of Muslims already warned us in the eleven
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; century, but not for a very long time).
</em><br />
<br />This has been very unfortunate.  This is a result of Christians
<br />
thinking that they understand everything about God.  This ironically
<br />
results in the Church turning into a (pre-Godelian in your opinion)
<br />
machine.  When you think you understand everything about God, then your
<br />
God turns into a machine and strangles you to death.
<br />
<br />But on the other hand, I think that our post-Godelian ignorance results
<br />
in our being even more lost that before!  The fact that now we CANNOT
<br />
know, if we are a machine, which machine we are, makes us even more
<br />
lost in a sea of meaninglessness than before.  Our hope has become even
<br />
more hopeless, not that the reductionist hope was well-founded either.
<br />
As you say, &quot;We can hope being God last word, but this is really
<br />
something which depends on our work and can never be taken for
<br />
granted.&quot;  I agree that we will never get God's last word (they are
<br />
infinite), and as above it is deadly to assume we have.  But you are
<br />
saying that we have not received ANY words from God.  In this case, we
<br />
have absolutely NO downward emanation, it is ALL upward.  If
<br />
&quot;Arithmetic Truth&quot; is our God, there remains an *infinite* gap to
<br />
fulfill our aspirations, which will always remain unbridged.  By
<br />
working from nothing, one step at a time, we will never get there.
<br />
&quot;Forever Unfulfilled&quot;, there can be no true fulfillment, only through
<br />
deceiving ourselves, which also leads to death...
<br />
<br />Tom
<br />
<br />P.S.  I am about to read Smullyan's &quot;Who Knows?&quot; about &quot;religious
<br />
consciousness&quot;.  Sorry I am not yet committed to reading Forever
<br />
Undecided, but I am halfway through Cutland's book on recursive
<br />
functions.
