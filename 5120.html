<br />You make it sound like a fringe statement, the reverse is in fact the case.
<br />
Bekenstein's limit (and subsequent works based on that) is mainstream
<br />
science.
<br />
<br />In practice these limits are ridiculously high: physical systems like people
<br />
are physical systems at 300 K, not singularties, nor balls of quark-gluon
<br />
plasma.
<br />
<br />If you look at how tissue computes (ignoring more lunatic claims as QC), it's
<br />
even way below chemical bond dissotiation limit -- wet 300 K systems with
<br />
some 10 W/l energy density, for Pete's sake, and most of it is used for
<br />
homeostasis/autopoiesis, so it's unavailable for information processing.
<br />
<br />I'd be really thankful if people used observed event rates and metabolic
<br />
rates, as well as input from (computational, and otherwise) neuroscience, as
<br />
well as robotics &amp; Co when discussing cognition and biological infoprocessing
<br />
in general.
<br />
<br />It would take a lot of slack and jaw out of the discussion.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If what you suggest is true, then your conclusion would follow.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claimed, though, that the reductionist thesis is in trouble, and you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asked why. There is a huge literature on emergentism and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionism, but let me just stick with the so-called mind-body 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issue that Hal also alluded to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There have been two main reductionist strategies to deal with mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states, and they both -- to say the least -- have stalled.  The two 
</em><br />
<br />I'm pretty sure it's in the eye of the observer. I would agree that
<br />
philosophy has been stalling for the last two kiloyears, when attempting to
<br />
explain cognition. Its bastard child science, not quite so. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; strategies are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.  Eliminative materialism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.  Identity theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eliminative materialism argued that human behavior could be explained 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientifically without reference to the mental states of folk 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psychology.  S-R behaviorism -- as in Skinner -- was the great effort 
</em><br />
<br />It's a complex enterprise; both requiring bottom-up and top-down. It appears
<br />
a bit premature to eliminate any approach for the benefit of another.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; here, and it is now largely judged a failure.  We seem to need mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states to explain human -- and even lower animal -- behavior.
</em><br />
<br />No offence, but I seem to detect a strong whiff of vis vitalis in the way you
<br />
use 'mental states'.
<br />
<br />All biological systems process information, from the lowly procaryonte to
<br />
the primate. Chemotaxis as biased randomwalk through frequency of flagellar
<br />
inversions in concentration gradients is not magically different from
<br />
saltatoric spike propagation in myelinated neurons of mammals. Both are
<br />
relatively simple events, describable at molecular scale. Of course, there's
<br />
a lot of emergence going on, if you have some 10^12 components.
<br />
<br />Mental states are just high-order emergent stuff. The only magic they have is
<br />
when you're introspecting, or trigger similiar representation systems when
<br />
emphatising during observation. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So then there is the identity theory, the attempt to show that each 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mental state is identical to some (or finitely many) physical states. 
</em><br />
<br />Isomorphic computation doesn't exist? I guess this means the end of emulator
<br />
industry. Somebody better tell them, before their stocks plummet.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, this has not panned out either.  At worst, we may be in for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some many-to-many correspondence between mental states and physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states, which spells doom for identity theory and reductionism.
</em><br />
<br />I must say I can't follow you conclusion here. You're even not bothering to
<br />
dismiss the strawman very convincingly.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I probably have not said enough to convince anyone here. This is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; big issue, and much more could be said.  I am just trying to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; summarize the current status of the mind-body debate.  At the very 
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure there is much difference between the &quot;mind-body&quot; debate and the
<br />
phlogiston, and the vis vitalis debate. You will remember, all of them were
<br />
associated with much gusto, and acrimony. Where are they now?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; least, the reductionist argument has been stalemated -- and there are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good reasons, having to do with the role of language, for thinking it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is false.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Norman suggests the upshot for the Tegmark thesis:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;Thoughts&quot; are therefore NOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;infinite because they can be conceptually defined in terms of particles and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum states, and there are not an infinite number of these permutations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, only if reductionism succeeds.  If reductionism fails, then, 
</em><br />
<br />Science is based on reductionism. The only way it can handle holism is
<br />
looking at emergent behaviour of pieces it has before dissected -- the old
<br />
Frankenstein thing. This is a surprisingly powerful mechanism, given modern 
<br />
tools like full inspectability at molecular scale, and modeling. (Who'd
<br />
thunk, these computers are good for anything, after all).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlike universes, which, on my reading of Tegmark, are discrete and 
</em><br />
<br />Is the population of universes in the metaverse infinite, or just very, very
<br />
large? How can we tell the difference?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; countable, thoughts are not only infinite but uncountably infinite. 
</em><br />
<br />An 18th century poet could have said that. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that case, thoughts -- and persons -- comprise an even larger 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinity than universes.  And -- although this is another argument -- 
</em><br />
<br />Apart from the fact that you're not providing any evidence for that,
<br />
have you ever considered the number of possible states in a system as complex
<br />
as the insides of a human noggin? If you look at how much trouble crypto
<br />
people are having when bruteforcing meek DES, there's a lot of them bits in
<br />
the space between our ears.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least a part of the universe would not behave deterministically.
</em><br />
<br />How can you tell the difference between random, and (deterministic)
<br />
pseudorandom? The experimental answer: you can't, even for trivial sized
<br />
assemblies.
<br />
<br />The question of free will and determinism is undecidedable for any being but
<br />
the omnipotent, omniscient (and even transcendent, given that you have to
<br />
violate the known laws of physics).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you tend to resist what I am suggesting, consider three things:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1.  How do you even individuate thoughts so as to count them or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlate them with physical states?  Is the belief that Mark Twain 
</em><br />
<br />Why would anyone be so foolish do that? It takes a lot of trouble to even
<br />
model single cells, save trivial-sized critters like a nematode.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrote Huckleberry Finn the same as or different from the belief that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Samuel Clemens wrote Huckleberry Finn?  Would that be one physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state you would seek to correlate with it or two?  There are lots of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well-discussed conceptual problems here.
</em><br />
<br />Does a GNUchess system running on SPARC, MIPS or x86 care much on which
<br />
platform it runs? It still plays chess.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. The mind-brain relation has sometimes been compared to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relation between software and hardware in computers.  A certain 
</em><br />
<br />With very good reasons, because it's a good model.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; software function might be endlessly realizable by different physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (hardware) configurations in different computers. Similarly, I 
</em><br />
<br />See, you're agreeing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose, the same hardware configuration might realize different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; software functions in different computers.  The analogy might break 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down, but this is the idea.
</em><br />
<br />Layers are a human design artifact, evolved systems tend to not have very
<br />
well defined modularity.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3.  The denial of reductionism does not necessarily entail belief in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is called &quot;a ghost in the machine,&quot; i.e., a soul or other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mystical something.  The denial of reductionism may instead imply 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that not only is there no ghost, there also is no machine (i.e., we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't behave in machine-like ways). (This is a point made by Searle.)
</em><br />
<br />Humans are always making analogies to well-known artifacts. Animals are
<br />
complex, so are some (very few, very large ones) machines. Searle is locking
<br />
in those aspects which the metaphor authors explicitly wanted to omit.
<br />
<br />Machines are not at all like animals. (In many aspects, yet).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John, I am not sure I understand everything you said. One thing I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would say along lines I think you suggest:  Determinism suggests a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closed system.  If you don't have a closed system, you don't get 
</em><br />
<br />What is a closed system? It depends on the scope. The universe is a closed
<br />
system, arguably. Yet, there's a lot of state in there.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic predictiveness.  Human thought is both holistic and 
</em><br />
<br />You will observe that PRNGs are very deterministic, and utterly
<br />
unpredictable. They are explicitly made to be anything but unlinear, but you
<br />
of course can make a PRNG take input from the proverbial bicycle toppling in
<br />
Peking. In fact, even many current computers take pains to tap physical
<br />
noise, to effectively evade the known-inner-state attack.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; unclosable.  Those features do not preclude mental causality, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they do preclude deterministic, causal laws.
</em><br />
<br />The dichotomy between PRNG and RNG (determinism, and free will) only makes
<br />
sense if you're God. 
<br />
<br />For us meek end users, the difference is undetectable.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, I hope I have not bored you all, but I do think that there are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considerations from the social sciences that bear on -- and possibly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; challenge  -- Tegmark's thesis.
