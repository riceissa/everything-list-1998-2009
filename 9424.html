Perhaps what you are in part getting at is the difference between
<br />
statements of opinion or value, on the one hand, and statements of fact
<br />
(either empirical or logical truths) on the other. The distinction seems
<br />
to have come late in the history of Western philosophy (the British
<br />
Empiricists, particularly David Hume), and it still isn't appreciated by
<br />
most non-philosophers. There is a sense in which the former type of
<br />
statement can be turned into the latter, if we accept some axiom against
<br />
which statements of value can be tested; however, the axiom is commonly
<br />
either unrecognized or falsely accorded the status of an empirical or
<br />
logical truth.

<br />
Finally, the very notion of continuity of personal identity, which is
<br />
necessary if &quot;survival&quot; is to have any meaning, is just as much a
<br />
product of evolutionary expedience. That is, it is no more logically
<br />
necessary that an organism is the &quot;same&quot; individual from one moment to
<br />
the next than it is logically necessary that an organism will strive to
<br />
survive from one moment to the next. Those organisms which run away when
<br />
a predator approaches because they believe they will be the same
<br />
individual in the next moment will thrive, while those which believe
<br />
that the organism with their approximate shape, memories, position etc.
<br />
in the next moment is a completely different individual, and don't care
<br />
if that other individual gets eaten, will die out. Such considerations
<br />
do not apply to most of the devices that humans produce, which
<br />
&quot;replicate&quot; on the basis of usefulness rather than a desire to survive
<br />
and have progeny. A car does not care if it is wrecked for spare parts
<br />
for use in another car, or a modern sculpture, or whatever, while even a
<br />
non-sentient organism such as a bacterium is essentially a machine with
<br />
no purpose other than maintaining its structural integrity from moment
<br />
to moment and producing exact copies of itself. 
<br />
<br />I want to add that while I agree with Stathis' remarks, we can abstract
<br />
this further and thereby resolve some of the popularly conceived
<br />
paradoxes of personal identity and of morality if we consider that what
<br />
we really want is to promote our *values* into the future.  This
<br />
explains how one can rationally sacrifice one's life for one's family or
<br />
the good of the greater group on the principle that this is consistent
<br />
with promoting the kind of world one (and by extension, most others)
<br />
would like to live in.  It also resolves the paradox of taking actions
<br />
today for the benefit of a self in the future, without the unrealistic
<br />
requirement of static personal identity.  Of course, we tend to think of
<br />
these actions as &quot;good&quot; because we are enmeshed in and a product of the
<br />
very process of evolution that tends to promote &quot;what works&quot; into the
<br />
future.
