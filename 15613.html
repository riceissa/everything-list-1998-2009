<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I guess what I am on about is a bit closer to the 80s idea of

<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - something that is inherently unpredictable; at least if you adopt

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the one you happen to find yourself in.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; I think you mean randomness, not chaos.  Chaos theory deals with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; deterministic systems that vary widely in result based on small
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; changes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; initial starting conditions; these systems are 100% predictable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Don't believe in randomness. &quot;Random&quot; means we don't understand what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; determines it. Like &quot;Junk DNA&quot;; it's only junk up until we work out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what it's really for.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You can predict with 100% accuracy that systems with varying initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; conditions will bifurcate and become chaotic once driven beyond a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; certain point. What you cannot say is what is determining the order  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the chaos once it arrives. That's closer to what I mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 2 men start to dig a hole. They are instructed to make it reach a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; depth of 5 feet. One of them murders the other with his shovel.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; predicted that would happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you know that?  Maybe it was quite predictable.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Except nobody did predict it. That's my point. It was perfectly  
<br />
obvious why only after the event. Police checks, medical checks etc.  
<br />
revealed the pattern that pointed to the causation. Before the event,  
<br />
this information was available too. Nobody saw anything tending or  
<br />
pending in the information beforehand.
<br />
<br />Schoolteachers have to do &quot;Risk assessments&quot; to evaluate the  
<br />
possibility of harm to students on excursion. Studies have shown that  
<br />
risk assessments do nothing to reduce the incidence of accidents or  
<br />
misadventure. Accidents simply happen. Accidents are still determined  
<br />
by something. We call it an accident only because we have no way  
<br />
before it happens of knowing that the cotter pin in the driving arm  
<br />
was about to shear off leaving the train without an effective brake  
<br />
system. Once the plane crashes, the black box reveals most of what we  
<br />
wish we had known beforehand.
<br />
<br />The problem is TIME - the sequence of the arrival of information  
<br />
determines how we look at it
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We can 'determine' the reasons for this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; event only AFTER it happens, even though it was determined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; something that we might have noticed prior to the event if only we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; been able to. All action can be seen as logically determined in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hindsight.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You must not have heard of quantum mechanics.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have. I am clearly speaking about the macro world where time travels  
<br />
(apparently) in one direction only and there is this tendency for an  
<br />
action to be followed by an effect or another action. 'Action' in this  
<br />
context refers mainly to the activity of conscious agents, humans. It  
<br />
may yet be shown that protons and quarks have 'agency' but that is not  
<br />
really at issue here
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  And how can you know the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causes seen in hindsight are correct.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not causes - merely that there existed a logical pattern of  
<br />
connections that led from A through to D that we were blind to at the  
<br />
time. If, in hindsight we do not spot the logical connections then we  
<br />
have no way of understanding the event at all. I guess there may well  
<br />
be examples of that, too
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Modeling the past is hard too.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In what sense do we know why the terrorists flew planes in the WTC?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Because everything we already knew about them before the event was  
<br />
still available to us after the event. After the event, everyone could  
<br />
see the powerful pattern in the data that they were blind to before  
<br />
the event. In a sense we knew this COULD happen. We simply could not  
<br />
predict that they would make the decision to act on what everybody  
<br />
(intelligence agancies, CIA etc.) already were aware of.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Before something happens is where we would like to be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on top of things. Intelligence exists on terrorism but usually this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; usually fails to determine our actions to prevent terrorist acts,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interestingly enough. If you look closely at what I am saying, it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the rather messy human consciousness part of the equation that SPOILS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the mathematical modelling in most cases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sure.  Humans and even most animals are extremely complicated.  Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things like weather and viscous flow over an aircraft are to  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to model except approximately over a limited range.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I am saying that a full
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perceptual scan of the situation often takes us way beyond what the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; data suggests. Just like the Mumbai massacre - intelligence WAS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; available that suggested it could happen. Yet the massacre was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;allowed&quot; to happen, because nobody could see the looming pattern in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the data until after it happened by which time it was bleeding  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to one and all. It seems that in many situations the sheer volume of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; information available is as much a part of the problem as the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; decision-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; making process. How do we decide? Data alone are incapable of making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; decisions. You still need a wet, messy human brain with a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perceptually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; skilled mind to do that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And apparently that doesn't work all that well either.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No it doesn't, if we only feed information and data into computers and  
<br />
expect the computer to do our thinking for us.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Isn't this kind of like an act of  faith?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; No.  Faith isn't based on evidence.  When we use math to model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; things in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; reality, we do so empirically.  If a distribution doesn't fit after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; testing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; it, we don't use it to model that set of data, for example.  How we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; use math
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; functionally is different from math itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Sure, but correlations occur between sets of data and there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tendency for them to look like causations. Most scientists and data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; collectors are trained to say &quot;correlations do not necessarily imply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; causations&quot; which is great advice up until the correlation turns out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to BE a causation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You just seem to on a rant against everyone who thinks, calculates,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicts, etc.
</em><br />
<br /><br />No - I am arguing for a different style of thinking, calculating,  
<br />
predicting. I am arguing for more of what I have called &quot;Creative  
<br />
thinking&quot; (Lateral thinking). Please go back and read my original post  
<br />
again.
<br />
<br />Creativity is not a matter of whether a particular idea is right or  
<br />
wrong. Creativity is not a matter of finding the best way of putting  
<br />
certain things together. Creativity is a matter of trying to get at  
<br />
what has been left out of the original way of looking at the  
<br />
situation. One can never get at this simply by judging the  
<br />
effectiveness of a particular way of looking at the situation. All of  
<br />
our mathematical formalities of calculating and predicting things are  
<br />
marvellous, wonderful and highly effective methods. I would be a fool  
<br />
to suggest otherwise. I in no sense advocate that we get rid of them.  
<br />
I suggest though, that we supplement them with creative thinking  
<br />
because this allows us to avoid or at best sidestep the traps of  
<br />
purely logical, vertical thinking. It is not a question of stopping  
<br />
doing something we are already doing. It is not a question of changing  
<br />
something we are already doing. It is a question of starting to do  
<br />
something we are not yet doing - or doing at best, only half-heartedly.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If we could perfectly model where things are heading then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; please tell me why all the BTSOAPs of the dismal science of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; economics world could not arrange a more stable financial future  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; us than the one we are currently moving into?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; The problem with (for example) economic forecasts is not that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; mathematics is flawed; the math is fine.  It's the data collection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; flawed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I would say that it is the premises - the starting assumptions that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are probably flawed, not the collection method, unless by collection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; method we include the starting assumptions which are unavoidably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; guiding the triage of the data.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It depends on the problem.  Calculating the flow over an aircraft  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hard because of data collection, it's hard because there are no closed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations and because the airplane
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has a complex shape. Calculations about what humans will do is hard  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because knowing what's in their brains is hard and because there are  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good models
</em><br />
<br /><br />So it appears then that we are in perfect agreement. Don't try and  
<br />
MINIMISE the problem, Brent! The &quot;wet, messy, human brain/mind  
<br />
problem&quot; is THE problem!
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The biggest flawed assumption of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is the belief that data collection of itself will give rise to ideas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and concepts. Data do not do that. We choose our starting points and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; assumptions in all cases. Often we aren't even aware of these because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; - well, they are assumptions and nobody really questions assumptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; much.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On what planet?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am saying that on the whole (not always) people skate past their  
<br />
assumptions - in business, in politics, in religion, in education, in  
<br />
a hundred thousand human endeavours. Maybe not so much in science and  
<br />
math and philosophy - which is why I think this list is one of the  
<br />
better audiences for what I am saying.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Our way of looking at the data is not itself present in any way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in the data. I'm saying that if reality conforms to our model of it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; then the danger is we are looking at only a part of the situation.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; issue in question is the WHOLE situation, not just that part we  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; CHOOSE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to look at. How can we ever be ccertain that we are in fact looking  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the whole situation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course we are never looking at *the whole situation* (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe?).  We know we are looking at enough of the situation when  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models make successful approximate predictions and when we understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where the errors come from.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Is it not interesting though, that &quot;where the errors came from&quot; is  
<br />
usually available to our minds only after the experiment has run,  
<br />
after the train has gone off the rails, after the planes have flown  
<br />
into the buildings etc.??
<br />
<br />I'm not saying that we should be trying to invent some kind of  
<br />
&quot;crystal Ball&quot; technology - only that techniques, formal techniques  
<br />
which enable a better perceptual understanding of future possibilities  
<br />
is already available to us and that it is high time we started to  
<br />
value these techniques more - indeed, to teach them starting with pre- 
<br />
schoolers. Education for one, NEVER teaches &quot;how to choose concepts&quot;.  
<br />
Yet, the concepts we use to view information are absolutely 100%  
<br />
behind the choices we make when we act on information. If we choose,  
<br />
for example the concept of &quot;ALLAHU AKHBAR&quot; as our starting premise for  
<br />
what we do, that then enables an enormous set of activities predicated  
<br />
on this idea. It is perfectly logical.
