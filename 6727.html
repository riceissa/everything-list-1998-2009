<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It looks as though you advocate a role for each of these:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   observables
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   measurements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   detectors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and for all I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seemed to me that MWI allowed me to get away with a considerable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplification. Gone were observers and even observations. Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurements, I discard. (After all, who can say that a measurement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurs in the middle of a star? And yet things do go on there, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now *some* of that language perhaps returns when decoherence is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussed. I mean, I'll grant that *something* significant starts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; off a new branch, and so it's okay for it to have a name.  :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But here is what I'd like to be able to say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A new branch starts, or decoherence obtains, or an irreversible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transformation occurs, or a record is made.  They all seem the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same to me. Why not?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My main motivation is to get as far away from Copenhagen as possible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so thereby get free of observers and observations, and anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else that seems to afford some pieces of matter a privileged status.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you think that such simplified language leaves out anything important?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I don't think we disagree much about the physics. The trouble is, the 
<br />
physics is even simpler than you suggest. Branching is not something 
<br />
special in the theory, it is a macroscopic description that we apply to 
<br />
what emerges from the theory.  If you simplify your language too much, all 
<br />
that happens is you have to define all those useful approximate terms from
<br />
scratch.
<br />
<br />Just for fun, here's how it would go:
<br />
<br />The framework of QM in the MWI is that
<br />
<br />(1) The state of the &quot;system&quot; (universe) can be represented by a 
<br />
time-dependant, normalized vector, say |S&gt;, in a Hilbert space.
<br />
<br />(2) Time evolution of |S&gt; is linear.
<br />
<br />That's it! (1) implies that time evolution is also unitary, so the vector 
<br />
stays normed. (1) + (2) imply the Schrodinger equation, including the fact 
<br />
that the generator of time evolution (&quot;Hamiltonian&quot;) is a Hermitian 
<br />
operator. (2) causes all the trouble.
<br />
<br />A full (non-framework) description requires you to (a) specify the Hilbert 
<br />
space (b) specify the Hamiltonian (c) specify the initial state. None of 
<br />
which are known exactly for the universe. (And in fact for the universe as 
<br />
a whole we had better adapt this description to relativity somehow, since 
<br />
you can't just take time as a given.)
<br />
<br />Now to introduce some more specific terms so we can relate the theory to 
<br />
everyday reality.
<br />
<br />&quot;Observable&quot;: In a simple system, the set of values of an observable are 
<br />
simply the labels we attach to elements of a basis, i.e. a set of 
<br />
orthogonal unit vectors (defining a &quot;coordinate system&quot;), in Hilbert 
<br />
space. We can freely choose any basis we like, but some are more useful 
<br />
than others because they relate to the structure and symmetries of the 
<br />
Hamiltonian. Let's call a basis {|o&gt;} where o is our variable label. The 
<br />
set might be finite, denumerable, or continuous, depending on the size of 
<br />
the Hilbert space. For convenience, and to make the transition to 
<br />
classical physics as seamless as possible, the labels are usually chosen 
<br />
to be real numbers.
<br />
<br />To put my previous answer to Serafino into this context, note that 
<br />
observables (e.g. position) play a very different role in the theory from 
<br />
time.
<br />
<br />For each basis, we can construct a linear operator on Hilbert-space 
<br />
vectors whose eigenvectors are the basis vectors and whose eigenvalues are 
<br />
our &quot;observable&quot; labels. If our labels are real, the operator will be 
<br />
Hermitian. With suitable choice of labels, the algebra of some of these 
<br />
operators approximately maps onto the algebra of variables in classical 
<br />
physics, which explains why classical physics works, and also how QM was 
<br />
discovered. (In particular, since the Hamiltonian itself is hermitian it 
<br />
has a set of real eigenvalues which we call &quot;Energy&quot;).
<br />
<br />&quot;Wave Function&quot;: The inner product of a basis vector with the state 
<br />
vector, written &lt;o|S&gt;, is &quot;geometrically&quot; the length of the projection of 
<br />
the state onto that basis vector, and so the &quot;cartesian coordinate&quot; along 
<br />
the axis defined by |o&gt;. In conventional QM it is the probability 
<br />
amplitude for &quot;observing&quot; o. If the basis is continuously infinite, as in 
<br />
position or momentum, &lt;o|S&gt; is a continuous function of the real variable 
<br />
(observable) o. This is what we call the &quot;wave function&quot; in o-space. (e.g. 
<br />
o = position, or momentum).
<br />
<br />&quot;Subsystems&quot;: In a complex system, we have to be a bit more careful. What 
<br />
physicists call observables certainly don't parameterize a complete basis 
<br />
for the universe. Such a complete basis would be characterised by a 
<br />
&quot;complete set of commuting observables&quot;. Commuting because their 
<br />
characteristic operators commute. In effect, we factorize the Hilbert 
<br />
space into subspaces (corresponding to quasi-independent subsystems). 
<br />
Practical observables correspond to bases on some subspace.
<br />
<br />&quot;Branching&quot;: In *some* bases of sufficiently complex systems (appropriate 
<br />
basis and needed complexity depending again on the Hamiltonian), the 
<br />
time-structure of the wavefunction approximates a branching tree. In those 
<br />
bases, the observable o corresponding to a particular branch (to within 
<br />
microscopic uncertainty) is the value that a suitable detector would 
<br />
record in that branch (as proved by Everett).
<br />
<br />&quot;detector&quot;: a subsystem which can interact with another subsystem and 
<br />
permanently correlate its state with the state the other subsystem 
<br />
had at the time of the interaction. The change in state of the detector 
<br />
is the &quot;record&quot;.
<br />
<br />&quot;observer&quot;: left as an exercise to the reader. In particular, why do 
<br />
observers find themselves more frequently in branches with high &quot;measure&quot; 
<br />
(= integral of |&lt;o|S&gt;|^2 over the o's corresponding to the branch)?
<br />
<br />Satisfied?
