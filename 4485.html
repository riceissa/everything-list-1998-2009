Hi Stephen,
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Dear Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Thank you for the reference to the Case papers. It is ironic that his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument makes the case for the subtle issue that I am trying to point out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to you, that there is a grave problem with your model.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     In <a href="http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/self-ref.html">http://www.cis.udel.edu/~case/self-ref.html</a> we find a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;informative discussion of self-reference and the way that infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regression is avoided by using an &quot;external&quot; aspect to act as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;mirror/sketch pad&quot; for the machine to use as a self-referential imaging
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system. While I do have some reservation regarding the assumption that N -&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;N functions can completely capture physics and the exclusive usage of Well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;founded statements in mathematics, I propose to set them aside for the sake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of a discussion.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />BM I am not sure which &quot;external aspect&quot; you allude to. Case'w work relies
<br />
on the second recursion of Kleene, which gives easy way to construct
<br />
self-referential programs. The &quot;mirror&quot; is really in machine's head.
<br />
The basic idea is very easy. Let D be a duplicator in the sense that
<br />
the program D applied to X, written DX, gives a description of X apply to
<br />
itself, that is XX.
<br />
So DA gives AA. DB gives BB. DC gives CC, ...
<br />
<br />What gives DD?
<br />
<br /><br />Yes. DD gives DD. It's an example of a duplicating program.
<br />
<br />For all transformation T you can generalize and find a program which
<br />
computes T applied to itself. Simple reproduction is the particular case
<br />
when T = the identity transformation: take a new &quot;duplicator&quot; which
<br />
apply to any X, written DX, gives T applied to a description of XX, that
<br />
is T(XX). Now DD gives T(DD). DD gives T applied to itself.
<br />
<br />So you get self-referential machines by the substitution of some
<br />
[variable of some transformation] by duplicator applied to themselves.
<br />
<br />You could say that the self-referentiality comes from the language
<br />
chosen, but working with Rogers numerical representations, the \phi_i,
<br />
you can show the reasoning constructive and machine, or programming
<br />
language, independent.
<br />
<br />What remains true is that any self-referential program needs a universal
<br />
program to run it, for making the self-referentiality manifest.
<br />
I have never deny that.
<br />
<br />What the universal dovetailer argument shows is that from the
<br />
point of view of the machine, if she looks closely enough to its probable
<br />
local implementation, that is near its comp substitution level, she will
<br />
describe not one universal machines, but MANY one.
<br />
<br />QM confirms that. But people  have invented selecting rules, like
<br />
the collapse of the wave or some guiding potential, making things look
<br />
more Aristotelian. But Everett comes and said &quot;why for?&quot;.
<br />
<br />And I come, if you want, and just say that if you take seriously the
<br />
Everett comp then you can ask &quot;why for?&quot; even for the Schroedinger Equation.
<br />
<br />Not because you should dismiss it, but because if it is true, it should
<br />
be derivable from LOGIC + ARITHMETIC. That the result of the UDA proof.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Your model, as I understand it, ...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />BM:
<br />
But I'm afraid you miss the point. It is not a &quot;model&quot;. It is not
<br />
a theory.
<br />
It is a &quot;theorem&quot;, a deductive argument. If you don't understand it,
<br />
you should tell me at which step of the reasoning you are stuck.
<br />
<br />I am not so interested in knowing if the hypotheses are true. I am
<br />
enough glad for showing them refutable.
<br />
<br />When a computationalist practitioners accepts an artificial digital
<br />
brain, he does not ask for a model in its head. He asks and hope for
<br />
the real thing.
<br />
<br />In case he survives (= COMP) he can bet he is immaterial. He can choose
<br />
is body and travel on the nets, without any stable body. The UDA result
<br />
is that this imateriality is contagious, in some sense, the environment
<br />
cannot be more material than himself. Descartes, Hume, and Kant have
<br />
partially describe this.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would seem to make the &quot;mirror/ sketch
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pad&quot; to be a derivative or &quot;epiphenomenona&quot; of the UD,
</em><br />
<br /><br />BM:
<br />
Why epiphenomena? They are phenomenal appearances, stable patterns in
<br />
consistent machines memories. Dreams if you want, but stable
<br />
dreams in which they have partial control ...
<br />
And thanks to the G/G* difference we get communicable and
<br />
incommunicable truth. Thanks to the Z/Z* difference we get
<br />
room for both physical measure and physical sensations, as
<br />
uncommunicable physical result of (self)measurement.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;e.g. that physicality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself is merely derived from the intetionality of arithmetic statements,
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Yes.
<br />
<br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what x implies about y. My argument is that if physicality is mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;epiphenomenona, is it sufficient to merely have a &quot;belief&quot; by S that x
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implies y to have a causal consequence on the possible behavior of S, such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that if x did not imply y behavior would be 3-person distinguishable?
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
... would be 1-person plural distinguishable (for the technical reason
<br />
that the quantum, seems to appear at the star level. I am not yet sure).
<br />
But you are right.  That is, if that is believable and consistent.
<br />
It is not that mind acts on matter, but it is more like the arithmetical
<br />
border of mind defines matter. Roughly speaking.
<br />
<br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     What I seem to be getting at is how do you relate 1-uncertainty to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3-person belief? I see the paper by Pratt that I have mentioned before makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some headway on this question, but have not seen any of your comments about
</em><br />
this.
<br />
<br />BM:
<br />
We will come back later on Pratt. It is very technical and he redefined
<br />
mind and body in a very special sense. I guess something interesting. We will
<br />
see if it helps for the Z1(*) semantics ...
<br />
Don't hesitate to send a readable description of Pratt's &quot;headway&quot;
<br />
for us all, anyway. Explain perhaps enough for explaining the subtle point
<br />
which, if I understand you, would make comp inconsistent, or perhaps trivial.
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />Bruno
