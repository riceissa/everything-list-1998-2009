<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who's old brain has been destroyed hasn't consigned themselves to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oblivion?
</em><br />
<br />It's not clear that it means anything to say that the person could have
<br />
died.  Here is why I say that.
<br />
<br />I think we agree that the person in the mechanical brain who leaves
<br />
the operation will not be able to tell whether it was a success or not.
<br />
He will have memories of going into the operation and coming out of it,
<br />
but is that good enough?  No, even if he is in your sense a new person,
<br />
he would still have those memories.  So the memories mean nothing.
<br />
<br />The problem with this reasoning is that it is consistent with the
<br />
possibility that we die in this same sense every night when we sleep.
<br />
Perhaps the person who wakes up is not the same person who went to sleep.
<br />
He has memories of falling asleep, just as the mechanical man has memories
<br />
of going into the operation.  But we just agreed that the existence of
<br />
such memories proves nothing.
<br />
<br />In fact, I don't think there is any way that we can ever prove that our
<br />
&quot;identity&quot; is maintained across sleep, or unconsciousness, or for that
<br />
matter from one moment to the next!  Maybe we are dying every instant,
<br />
but we can't tell, because we are constantly being re-created with our
<br />
memories of the previous events.
<br />
<br />Given that there is no way for the subject or any other person to tell
<br />
the truth or false of this, isn't it possible that there is no truth or
<br />
falsity to tell?
<br />
<br />Hal
