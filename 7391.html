Dear Lee, and Stathis,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been pondering the various threads discussing OMs and 
<br />
&quot;continuity&quot; requirements and have a couple of questions.

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I [may] have to say that we are two different people when we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are separated by time as well as space or across parallel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universes. What I would say is that my successor tomorrow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is potentially &quot;me&quot; if there is continuity of consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between all the intermediates between now and then.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm skeptical of &quot;continuity&quot; requirements. Now I do not believe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Greg Egan's equations in &quot;Permutation City&quot;: according to a premise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the story, it order to obtain the you of tomorrow, there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; short-cut alternative to just letting you run.  And that is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determine the solutions of an immense number of differential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equations that do not in fact emulate your intermediary states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this were so, then it may be that you could discontinuously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skip past all of tonight and tomorrow's experiences, and just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; start living by directly experiencing the day after that.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it not seem that the continuity requirement is such that it only 
<br />
comes up when we consider either an external 3rd person P.o.V. of a OM 
<br />
chaining P.o.V. or an internal 1st person of a memory of having changed 
<br />
one's mind about something is some other OM?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's easy to imagine this being possible; when I was a teen and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was faced with the loathsome task of mowing the lawn, I wondered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if it could be possible for me to just not have that experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at all, but for my life to just magically resume after the chore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was completed (somehow).  I was aware that what I wanted was not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply memory erasure.
</em><br />
<br />[LC]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we erase our memories of having done the loasome event after actually 
<br />
going through it, do we not need to also erase the memory of any other 
<br />
witness that might be able  to remind us of the event?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can a OM encode a trace of other OMs such that it can capture the 
<br />
notion of &quot;remembering something&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [Stathis]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The successor of my duplicate with the headache does not satisfy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; this criterion and is therefore not potentially &quot;me&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, are you sure?  What if he takes a memory-erasure pill
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (that works much more perfectly than Midazolam) and thereby
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes a past state that is identical to one of &quot;your&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past states, and then evolves forward into states that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitely consider to be your natural successors.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, exactly makes me &quot;me&quot;? Is it &quot;I am what I remember myself to be&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; After people are uploadable, this could happen without much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fuss all the time. The interplay of and algebraic combinatorial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibilities of *memory addition*, *experience*, and *memory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; erasure* lead back to the notion that one is just a fuzzy set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the collection of all persons or person-states.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This scenario sound to me like a MWI version of time travel, where 
<br />
&quot;erasure&quot; happens everywhere to the memories of possible witnesses but not 
<br />
to the person doing the time traveling. Thus, if the time traveler takes a 
<br />
Blue Pill evertime he steps into the Time Machine portal, he, from his 
<br />
P.O.V. dies and from the P.o.V. of some witness (to his stepping thru the 
<br />
portal) just vanishes.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I missing something here?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [Stathis]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Arbitrary though this criterion for continuity of identity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; may be, it is the criterion our minds have evolved with,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and calling it irrational will not change that fact.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, some of this is involuntary, but some of it is not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've never seen how to shake *anticipation*, for example,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and suppose that we're just stuck with it, problems and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all. But actually I don't have any problem believing that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I *am* my duplicates, even those across the room, who are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just me seeing a different perspective of the room (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps having slightly different thoughts).
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have any problem believing that I *am* all of my duplicates 
<br />
either, so long as there is some way that the &quot;me&quot; that I remember now could 
<br />
be smoothly continued within the world of a duplicate *and* all witnesses 
<br />
agree that I did all that I claim I did with in that world.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise, I will need some serious phychiatric help for my 
<br />
Schitzophrenia! (Ever watch the movie &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;?)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [Stathis]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If we are to be strictly rational and consistent, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; is simplest to go to the extreme of saying that *none*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the instantiations of an individual are actually the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;same&quot; person, which is another way of saying that each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; observer moment exists only transiently. This would mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that we only live for a moment, to be replaced by a copy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; who only thinks he has a past and a future.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly what is the definition of &quot;rational&quot; here? Is it the same as my 
<br />
implied &quot;sane&quot;, e.g. not schitzophrenic?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mike Perry, in his book &quot;Forever For All&quot; develops these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the idea of &quot;day-persons&quot;, i.e., the idea that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not the same person from day to day. But that's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly not a satisfactory way of extending our usual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions into these bizarre realms; you and I want to live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next week because we believe that we are the same persons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we'll be then.  And the idea that we *are* fuzzy sets in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person space permits this.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DOes Mike Perry elaborate on how anyone can know for sure that &quot;they are 
<br />
not the same person from day to day&quot;. What does he define &quot;same&quot; to be?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [Stathis]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; We die all the time, so death is nothing to worry about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [LC]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On this definition, yes. But this is *such* an impractical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach. We all know that it's bad for your neighbor when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he dies, despite us and him totally believing in the MWI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We would like to avoid having to say that we die all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we really just recoiling in horror at the prospect of our own 
<br />
non-existence (mortality) and trying like madmen to find an escape clause? 
<br />
Isn't this the same motivation that exists at the root of Religions?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is true, can we admit it to ourselves; much like Tippler has?
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen
