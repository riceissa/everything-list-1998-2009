<br />If you have a function on the integers that takes each integer and assigns 
<br />
it either a one or a zero, the total number of such functions is equal in 
<br />
cardinality to the reals--just think of writing each real in binary, with 
<br />
each successive digit labeled by the next integer. This set is also equal in 
<br />
cardinality to the power set (set of all subsets) of the integers--for every 
<br />
function that assigns each integer a one or a zero, you can make a subset 
<br />
that includes only the integers assigned a one by that function, and so 
<br />
there'll be a one-to-one relationship between the set of all subsets of the 
<br />
integers and the set of all these functions.
<br />
<br />There's a general theorem in set theory that the power set of any set must 
<br />
have a higher cardinality than the set itself, based on a diagonalization 
<br />
argument. Therefore, by the same type of reasoning, it must be true that the 
<br />
set of all possible functions defined on the reals that assign each real a 
<br />
one or a zero must have a higher cardinality than the reals themselves. 
<br />
Similarly, the set of all meta-functions defined on the set of all the 
<br />
functions I just described must have a still higher cardinality, and so on. 
<br />
I don't know the answer to the questions about curves or hyperreals though. 
<br />
And of course, all this is assuming you &quot;believe&quot; in the hierarchy of 
<br />
infinite cardinalities, which as I said in my last post I feel a bit iffy 
<br />
on.
