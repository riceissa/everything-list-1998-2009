<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thank you Jesse for your clear answer. Your comparison

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of your use of both ASSA and RSSA with Google ranking system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has been quite useful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This does not mean I am totally convince because ASSA raises the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem of the basic frame: I don't think there is any sense to compare

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the probability of &quot;being a human&quot; or &quot;being a bacteria&quot; ..., but your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;RSSA use of ASSA&quot; does not *necessarily* give a meaning to such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strong form of absolute Self Sampling Assumption, or does it?
</em><br />
<br />No, I don't think it's *necessary* to think that way. Nick Bostrom gives a 
<br />
good example of the use something like the &quot;absolute self-sampling 
<br />
assumption&quot; in the FAQ of anthropic-principle.com, where two &quot;batches&quot; of 
<br />
humans would be created, the first batch containing 3 members of one sex, 
<br />
the second batch containing 5000 members of the opposite sex. If I know I am 
<br />
the outcome of this experiment but I don't know which of the two batches I 
<br />
am a part of, I can see that I am a male, and use Bostrom's version of the 
<br />
self-sampling assumption to conclude there's a 5000:3 probability that the 
<br />
larger batch is male (assuming the prior probability of either batch being 
<br />
male was 50:50). One way to look at this is that if the larger batch is 
<br />
male, &quot;I&quot; have a 5000/5003 chance of being male and a 3/5003 chance of of 
<br />
being female--but presumably since you don't think it makes sense to talk 
<br />
about the &quot;probability&quot; of being a bacteria vs. a human, you also wouldn't 
<br />
think it makes sense to talk about the &quot;probability&quot; of being a male vs. 
<br />
being a female. So, another way to think of this would just be as a sort of 
<br />
abstract mathematical assumption you must make in order to calculate the 
<br />
conditional probability that, when I go and ask the creators of the 
<br />
experiment whether the larger batch is male or female, I will have the 
<br />
experience of hearing them tell me it was male. This mathematical assumption 
<br />
tells you to reason *as if* you were randomly sampled from all humans in the 
<br />
experiment, but it's not strictly necessary to attach any metaphysical 
<br />
significance to this assumption, it can just be considered as a step in the 
<br />
calculation of probabilities that I will later learn various things about my 
<br />
place in the universe.
<br />
<br />In a similar way, one could accept both an absolute probability distribution 
<br />
on observer-moments and a conditional probability distribution from each 
<br />
observer-moment to any other, but one could view the absolute probability 
<br />
distribution as just a sort of abstract step in the calculation of 
<br />
conditional probabilities. For example, consider the two-step duplication 
<br />
experiment again. Say we have an observer A who will later be copied, 
<br />
resulting in two diverging observers B and C. A little later, C will be 
<br />
copied again four times, while B will be left alone, so the end result will 
<br />
be five observers, B, C1, C2, C3, and C4, who all remember being A in the 
<br />
past. Assuming the probable future of these 5 is about the same, each one 
<br />
would be likely to have about the same absolute probability. But according 
<br />
to the Google-like process of assigning absolute probability I mentioned 
<br />
earlier, this means that later observer-moments of C1, C2, C3 and C4 will 
<br />
together &quot;reinforce&quot; the first observer-moment of C immediately after the 
<br />
split more than later observer-moments of B will reinforce the first 
<br />
observer-moment of B immediately after the split, so the first 
<br />
observer-moment of C will be assigned a higher absolute probability than 
<br />
that of B. This in turn means that A should expect a higher conditional 
<br />
probability of becoming C than B. So again, you can say that this final 
<br />
answer about A's conditional probabilities is what's really important, that 
<br />
the consideration of the absolute probability of all those future 
<br />
observer-moments was just a step in getting this answer, and that absolute 
<br />
probabilites have no meaning apart from their role in calculating 
<br />
conditional probabilities. I can't think of a way to justify the conclusion 
<br />
that A is more likely to experiencing becoming C in this situation without 
<br />
introducing a step like this, though.
<br />
<br />Personally, I would prefer to assign a deeper significance to the notion of 
<br />
absolute probability, since for me the fact that I find myself to be a human 
<br />
rather than one of the vastly more numerous but less intelligent other 
<br />
animals seems like an observation that cries out for some kind of 
<br />
explanation. But I think this is more of a philosophical difference, so that 
<br />
even if an ultimate TOE was discovered that gave unique absolute and 
<br />
conditional probabilities to each observer-moment, people could still differ 
<br />
on the interpretation of those &quot;absolute probabilities&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think also that your view on RSSA is not only compatible with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the sort of approach I have developed, but is coherent with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Saibal Mitra&quot; backtracking, which, at first I have taken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as wishful thinking.
</em><br />
<br />What is the &quot;backtracking&quot; idea you're referring to here?
<br />
<br />OK you make me feel COMP could be a little less
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frightening I'm use to think.
</em><br />
<br />Well, if I've spared you some sleepless nights I'm glad! ;)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Concerning consciousness theory and its use to isolate a similarity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relation on the computational histories---as seen from some first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point of view, I will try to answer asap in a common answer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Stephen and Stathis (and you) who asked very related questions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Alas I have not really the time now---I would also like to find a way to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the consciousness theory without relying too much on mathematical logic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but the similarity between 1-histories *has* been derived  technically in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the theory which is the most counter-intuitive ... mmh  I will try soon 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I definitely hope to understand the details of your theory someday, I 
<br />
think I will need to learn some more math to really follow it well though. 
<br />
My current self-study project is to try to learn the basic mathematical 
<br />
details of quantum computation and the many-worlds interpretation, but after 
<br />
that maybe I'll try to study up a bit on mathematical logic and recursive 
<br />
function theory. And even if I do, there's the little problem of my not 
<br />
knowing French, but I'll cross that bridge when I come to it...
