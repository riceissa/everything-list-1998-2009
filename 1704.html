<br />Physicists coax atom to be two places at  same time
<br />
<br />ASSOCIATED PRESS
<br />
<br />Physicists say they have managed to nudge atoms back and forth between our
<br />
everyday world and the strange quantum realm where objects can paradoxically
<br />
be in two places at the same time.
<br />
<br />If physicists can further refine their control over this realm, it could
<br />
result in incredibly fast quantum computers able to crack even the toughest
<br />
encryption codes now used by conventional computers.
<br />
<br />Quantum theory holds that objects on the subatomic level can simultaneously
<br />
be in two places or have other
<br />
properties that seem contradictory in the everyday world.
<br />
<br />Scientists have achieved quantum states. But in an experiment reported in
<br />
today's issue of the journal Nature, they were able to move atoms into and
<br />
out of quantum states with more precision than before. That kind of control
<br />
is necessary if scientists are to come up with practical devices that employ
<br />
quantum principles.
<br />
<br />For example, a quantum computer could store information in the quantum
<br />
states of atoms or molecules instead of in silicon chips. But for such a
<br />
computer to work, scientists would have to be able to block the outside
<br />
forces that can cause a quantum state to collapse.
<br />
<br />David Wineland and fellow researchers at the National Institute of Standards
<br />
and Technology in Boulder, Colo., coaxed a beryllium atom in a vacuum to be
<br />
in two places at the same time -- the paradoxical ``Schroedinger's cat''
<br />
state. The researchers then caused the system to collapse by introducing
<br />
contact to the outside world.
<br />
<br />Austrian physicist Erwin Schroedinger proposed the cat paradox in the early
<br />
20th century. He described the hypothetical situation of a cat in a box with
<br />
vial of cyanide gas capped by a decaying radioactive atom, which would
<br />
release the poison once it decayed. Under quantum theory, the atom could be
<br />
in both states, meaning the cat could be both dead and alive.
<br />
<br />The researchers in Colorado said they were able to keep a beryllium ion in a
<br />
Schroedinger's cat-like state for as long as as 100-millionths of a second.
<br />
<br />To do that, the beryllium atom was cooled to close to absolute zero -- minus
<br />
459 degrees -- and isolated from all types of radiation, radio waves and
<br />
other energy sources. The researchers then used lasers to force the atom's
<br />
single electron into two states of spin, which forced the atom to be in two
<br />
places at the same time.
