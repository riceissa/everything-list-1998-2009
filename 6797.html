<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (assuming t1 and t2 are the same length). The only significance of the fact

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there are &quot;more&quot; OM's at t2 is that the person can expect a greater 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variety of possible experiences at t2 if the OM's are all distinct.
</em><br />
<br />It's a good puzzle.  Some time back I expressed it as follows: suppose
<br />
the measure of the even days of my life were arranged to be twice as
<br />
good as the measure of the odd days.  How would I notice this?  Would I
<br />
somehow be more likely to experience an even day?  Should I arrange
<br />
to have good things happen on even days and bad things on odd days?
<br />
I don't see how I would notice any difference.
<br />
<br />Now, I lean more to a favorable answer to these questions.  In fact I
<br />
would say, yes, I should arrange to have good things happen on even days.
<br />
Even though the difference is not directly perceptible, I believe I
<br />
would be making the universe a better place.
<br />
<br />Here are a chain of examples.  I won't try to offer much justification
<br />
at each step, I am just sketching an argument.
<br />
<br />First, consider 10 people.  We can either give 9 of them a good experience
<br />
and 1 of them a bad one, or 9 of them bad and 1 of them good.  It is
<br />
clear that it is better to give the 9 good and 1 bad.
<br />
<br />Now, consider 2 people.  We are going to give the first a good experience
<br />
and the second a bad one.  But we can make 9 copies of the first, or
<br />
9 copies of the second, as we do it.  I claim it is better to make 9
<br />
copies of the first, the one who is having a good experience.
<br />
<br />Now, consider a person who goes through life but who has a problem with
<br />
his short term memory that makes him forget what happens every day.
<br />
(Fictional examples can be seen in the movies Memento and Fifty First
<br />
Dates, although I don't know how realistic they are.  Keep in mind this
<br />
is just a thought experiment and not dependent on any actual details of
<br />
human pathology.)  We can either give him 9 days of good experiences
<br />
and 1 bad, or vice versa.  I claim it is better to make the 9 days be
<br />
good experiences and 1 day bad, rather than the other way around.
<br />
<br />And finally consider an ordinary person who remembers things from one
<br />
day to the next.  On day 1 something good happens and on day 2 something
<br />
bad happens.  We can either make him have 9 times the measure on day 1
<br />
or on day 2.  I claim that it is better to give him 9 times the measure
<br />
on day 1, when the good thing happens.
<br />
<br />Now, you may be saying, where is the argument?  These are just examples
<br />
with unsupported claims.  The point is to show that in all these examples
<br />
the people are unaware of the changes in measure and numbers of good
<br />
and bad experiences.  But that doesn't change the fact that it is still
<br />
better to cause more good experiences in the world than bad.
<br />
<br />Would we say that it is OK to mistreat a person with lack of short
<br />
term memory just because they won't remember it?  I don't think so.
<br />
It still causes genuine pain and suffering.  Giving them good experiences
<br />
causes joy.  The 50 First Dates movie expresses this in a poignant and
<br />
moving matter.  People are willing to sacrifice to bring happiness to
<br />
someone they love who suffers such a condition.  I thought this was
<br />
an excellent movie BTW, although you have to overlook some extremely
<br />
juvenile humor.  Memento was also interesting but much darker in tone.
<br />
<br />It is the same with all the examples.  Causing more experiences of
<br />
joy is better than causing more experiences of sadness.  Even with
<br />
the one person who lives from day to day, it still applies.  He is not
<br />
subjectively aware of his measure changing, but if he or anyone else has
<br />
objective awareness of the circumstance, the same logic that applies in
<br />
the other examples works here as well.  Give more happiness to the days
<br />
with greater measure.  That makes the world a better place.
<br />
<br />Now for an interesting twist.  Our measure decreases steadily in life.
<br />
Every day we have a certain probability of dying, and our measure
<br />
decreases by that fraction.  The reasoning in the examples above would
<br />
imply that it is better to have happiness when our measure is high, which
<br />
is when we are young.  Unhappiness in old age has less impact.  So if
<br />
you are putting off some happiness, do it today, don't procrastinate.
<br />
<br />(Of course, you get much the same result in a non-multiverse model,
<br />
where putting off a reward makes you risk dying before you get to
<br />
experience it.)
<br />
