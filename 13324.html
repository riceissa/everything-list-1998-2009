<br />
&quot;&gt; Well, again, this is a functional description of *some* 
<br />
aspects of
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness with which we are familiar.  I would say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in general does not require does not require a self
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model.  Reflection on the motivation system generates self-awareness I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think, but other types of reflection don't involve self-awareness.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />MP: I think a point to note is that, in so far as consciousness 
<br />
is *about* something or other, the something or other is viewed, 
<br />
perceived, conceived, constructed, made 'knowable', whatever, 
<br />
*from a point of view*. This point of view, which is where I 
<br />
'am' in the relevant context, may be just implicit in most 
<br />
experiences but is definitely explicit at other times. I think 
<br />
this reflects our general predisposition to naive realism which 
<br />
is the product of Darwinian evolution; in many if not most of 
<br />
the situations in which our early ancestors found themselves it 
<br />
was not particularly useful to be aware of the process of 
<br />
construction of the experience, in fact the energy and mind 
<br />
space necessary to do so would have a very high opportunity 
<br />
cost, life threatening in fact. To put it another way: 
<br />
self-awareness is a philosophical necessity but a biological 
<br />
luxury.
<br />
<br />MG:
<br />
&quot; &gt; Reflection is the process of reasoning about cognitive 
<br />
systems (ie
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive systems recursively calling other cognitive systems).  If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanations of cognitive systems cannot be entirely reduced to low
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level physics, then it appears that reflection must involve a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of causality which cannot be reduced to mere computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed, one could say that reflection IS a form of higher-order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causality - the higher level processes involved in reasoning about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognitive systems and lower-level physics.  Consciousness is of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *composed* of computation and physical processes (according to all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; available scientific evidence).  But the *explanations* of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness are not necessarily completely reducible to these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />MP: I agree that mental reflection IS a form of higher level 
<br />
causality. I think though that it is NOT possible to totally 
<br />
reduce something to something else yet still retain the original 
<br />
reality in its completeness. But 'reduction', vaccinated with 
<br />
sufficient doses of 'ceteris paribus', is still enormously 
<br />
powerful. It is a central tool of scientific method. The way I 
<br />
see it, what we are calling reduction is in fact *synthesis* of 
<br />
a representational system which by definition embodies 
<br />
abstractions of what are considered to be the relevant essential 
<br />
features, usually requiring some mathematical format to obtain 
<br />
the maximum leverage.
<br />
<br />My acronym for what goes on is &quot;UMSITW&quot; [pronounced 
<br />
'um-see-two'] which means Updating Model of Self In The World. I 
<br />
am not impressed by assertions that consciousness is sometimes 
<br />
not ABOUT anything in particular. I think that the kind of 
<br />
experiences being referred to, such as a 'no-mind' state of 
<br />
meditation, are what it is like to be the high gain system when, 
<br />
after much practice, the brain has been trained to virtually 
<br />
cease evoking representations.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: How about: consciousness is simply [ie no more and no less

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; than] the *registration of change* in one's model of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-in-the-world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My understanding, from my [admittedly-] shallow but obsessive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and persistent reading of abstracts and articles, is that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reasonable case can be made that  sentience in vertebrates can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be correlated to the fact of and extent that the outcome of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; perception and action does not match expectation. The gist of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the mechanism is that every time an 'instruction' to move or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; change perceptual focus is generated and emitted to muscles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and/or adaptable sense organs, a matching emission goes to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cerebellum. There the 'expectation' - the amalgamated result of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; all previous instances - is evoked in concert with the outcome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of the current new instance. Any discrepancies are then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; available for feedback and feed-forward to modulate the activity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and warn of potential problems.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That sounds like a pretty good description of *how* consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arises, but it doesn't actually explain *what* consciousness in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; general actually is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The model of self in the world is just a bunch of network
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; activations which embody/describe/denote/are the situational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; awareness and navigational controls of the entity. For human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; beings, who can tell themselves and each other stories, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; model of self in the world clearly must include much description
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of social and personal history. For the model of self in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world to exist [and be any use at all] it must entail
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; representations of currently significant features of the world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; currently relevant aspects of 'self', and relevant relationships
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; between self and world. The representation of self incorporates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recursive self-references and therefore constitutes a process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that is present and unique [and to a great extent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unpredictable]. There is therefore something which actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exists. The constant updating of this model of self in the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; IS the experience we call consciousness or awareness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, again, this is a functional description of *some* aspects of
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What we call time can be seen as the story, or sets of stories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we tell ourselves and each other in order to account for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; changes that are occurring and to predict and control what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; expect to occur. Calling time a 'dimension' therefore, or a set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of dimensions, seems to me to be a rather abstract fudge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Enormously useful of course, we couldn't make social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; appointments or launch space rockets without 'time', but aren't

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we just reifying a human construct when we do this?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It all depends on whether high level concepts (concepts at the level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of functional systems) are completely reducible to explanations in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of low level physics.  If they are (if reductionism is true)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then indeed, it would appear that the passgae of time has no reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (it would be merely a useful human fiction as you point out).  But if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionism is not true (as I suspect), then time could more complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than is commonly thought.
