</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In an actual physical computer the transition rules are represented  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the causal links between the states, so that a particular input will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reliably give rise to a particular output. But I return to my  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; about what would happen if there were a discontinuity in a sequence  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; states, so that s1 to s10 on m1 are causally linked, s11 to s20 on m2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are causally linked, but there is no link between m1 and m2, i.e. m2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; just happens to start in s11 accidentally. Assuming that s1 to s20
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; occurring in a single machine results is a few moments of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; consciousness (which is to say, assuming that computationalism is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; true), what would happen if the sequence is broken in the way just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; described?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suspect something is lost.  You are thinking of the states as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract steps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a computer program.  But a computer program requires a computer  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to run
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is true, but the word &quot;run&quot; is ambiguous. It could be a  
<br />
mathematical run. It is digital some we can use the natural numbers  
<br />
and the successor relation for the first order time of the UD run.  
<br />
Independent subcomputations manage their own &quot;time&quot;. Physical time is  
<br />
something else: it emerges in the plural first person perspective.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From the point of view of the machine it makes no difference (it is  
<br />
the MGA point).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the computer implements distributed spatiotemporal links.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This of course is not proved, but admittedly required for a materialist.
<br />
(I guess you were saying: &quot;the computer is implemented by  
<br />
spatiotemporal links&quot;)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In general you cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take even a digitial computer and freeze it in a instant of time,  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state, and restart it without any effects.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Apparently, homeotherm animals can be frozen and heated back and still  
<br />
keep even their short term memory, if I remember correctly (!).  
<br />
Experiences with rats suggest this is the case, according to Michel  
<br />
Jouvert (the discoverer of REM sleep).
<br />
<br />But what I really want to say is this. Even if you were true, or  
<br />
Jouvet false, actually even if our relevant brain state was a quantum  
<br />
state, which when unknown are not duplicable, it would change nothing.  
<br />
I suppose some high level in UDA(1...6) only for making the reasoning  
<br />
more easy. At step seven, all what matters is that there is a level  
<br />
were you are in principle digitally describable, be it the galaxy .  
<br />
The reason is that if such a level exist then the UD will access that  
<br />
state, infinitely often, in many subcomputations, and  
<br />
subsubcomputations.
<br />
And this gives the fundamental first person (plural) indeterminacy:  
<br />
the fact that each computation, from the 1-pov, more exactly from the  
<br />
obligatory (by UDA('1...6)) 3-pov on the 1-pov, bifurcate or  
<br />
differentiate into 2^aleph_zero histories in the universal deployment.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Switches are in intermediate states,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; EM waves are propagating, electrons are diffusing - it is not a  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; static thing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like a step in a program.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think comp explains the appearance of continua, and the relative  
<br />
correctness of that view. But that &quot;thing&quot;, the concrete computer, is  
<br />
a local approximation of the true thing (with the comp assumption). If  
<br />
its representation abilities are locally enough stable relatively to  
<br />
you, it will make possible for the &quot;true thing&quot; to manifest itself  
<br />
relatively to your histories. The &quot;true&quot; thing being the person, not  
<br />
its relative (to you) envelop or  description.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In terms of Bruno's teleporter, one might say yes accepting that  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a one-time gap in consciousness (ever had a concussion?), but one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hesitate if the there was to be a gap every 10ms.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;From the ultimate third point of view, there are no gap, or there are  
<br />
gaps everywhere, that could depend on the topology or topologies you  
<br />
will extract from the numbers. Strictly speaking there are only the  
<br />
natural numbers and their many arithmetical relations. Now some  
<br />
arithmetical relation define or represent universal computation(s),  
<br />
including all finite portions of the universal deployment.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From the first point of view, there is no gap. For the same reason  
<br />
that the Everett observer, when measuring, with an {UP,DOWN}-measuring  
<br />
apparatus a particle in the state UP+DOWN, will not feel the split or  
<br />
feel self-superposed. The first person experience is determined by the  
<br />
possible relations you have with your most probable universal history,  
<br />
among already 2^aleph_zero very similar universal histories. Those are  
<br />
just arithmetical relations (assuming ...). From the first person  
<br />
point of view, your concern is not limited to the finite portions of  
<br />
the universal deployment: you are directly concerned by the infinite  
<br />
deployment, in its entirety, and this just because you cannot be aware  
<br />
(UDA 4) of the more and more monumental gaps generated by the UD, or  
<br />
existing in UD* (the universal deployment).
<br />
<br />I could speculate on the fact (not needed in the UDA) that we can  
<br />
never be unconscious. In the morning, when we wake up, we can have the  
<br />
feeling that we have been unconscious, but that feeling could be a  
<br />
mind construct, a programmed amnesia on the conscious activity of the  
<br />
night. *the* &quot;unconscious&quot; seen as what you are not conscious *of*,  
<br />
could still make sense, but it could be that a person is never  
<br />
unconscious: gaps would be false memories (having some role). Although  
<br />
always conscious, the person could and usually is unconscious *of*  
<br />
many things, of course, like a person can forget things. This leads to  
<br />
the fusion (of person and/or histories) topic. Differentiation and  
<br />
Dedifferentiation.
