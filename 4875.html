Hi,
<br />
<br />I found this post really thoughtful, but I didn't quite agree. Let's see if
<br />
I can argue on it:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Doesn't this part:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In a materialistic framework, ' I ' am a bunch of atoms. These atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; happen to constitute a system that has self-referential qualities that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we call consciousness. If it happened that these atoms temporarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (like in a coma or anesthesy) or permanently (death) lose this quality,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so will ' I '.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Contradict this part:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is not useful to talk about 1st person experiences in 3rd person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; terms, since when we do that we lose the very thing that we want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to study.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since surely one can describe &quot;a bunch of atoms with self-referential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; qualities&quot; in wholly objective, i.e. 1st person, terms?   But I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting ahead of myself here..  I think we actually agree on 99% of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this issue.  I think the only place we disagree is on some very subtle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; issues regarding how one can refer to &quot;I&quot;.  Let me then explicitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state that I am a materialist and a functionalist with regard to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Let me stress this point: *I am, for all practical purposes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; one and only one specific configuration of atoms in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; specific universe. I could never say that ' I ' is ALL the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; copies, since I NEVER experience what the other copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Here I think you're making an assumption. You are certainly not ALL
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; copies, but then it doesn't follow that you are only 1.  &quot;You&quot; could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a fuzzy set of copies that have experiences so similar that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; be told apart.  That is, they cannot be told apart &gt;yet&lt;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Unnoticeable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; differences eventually can percolate up and make a noticeable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; difference, or they can be made noticeable by making more sensitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; observations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Yes, I am making an assumption, and working through it. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumption is that there is nothing external to the physical body to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; account for consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I totally agree with &gt;this&lt; assumption.  It's the &quot;one and only one&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; part that I disagree with, to this extent:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You may, if you wish, decide to refer to one and only one universe and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the Eric within that universe.  That is, you can stipulate that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eric you are referring to is a completely specified entity.  But to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so meaningfully, you would need to take some sort of god-like view of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the plenitude, and *actually specify* the Eric you're talking about.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Otherwise how do you know what you are referring to?  Just saying &quot;I&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or &quot;one and only one&quot; does not do the job.  (Like Wittgenstein's man
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who says &quot;I know how tall I am!&quot; and proves it by putting his hand on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; top of his head.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's say that you were able to completely specify one Eric, by giving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a (possibly infinitely) long description.  Let's call the entity you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have thus specified &quot;Eric01&quot;.  Our point of difference seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this:  You believe that when Eric01 says &quot;I&quot;, he is referring precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Eric01.  I believe that when Eric01 says &quot;I&quot;, he is referring to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire ensemble of Erics who are identical to Eric01 in all the ways
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eric01 is capable of detecting.  Because each member of this ensemble
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is also saying &quot;I&quot;, and meaning the same thing by it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now you would say that since each completely specified Eric is in fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different, each one has a different consciousness.  Here is where our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disagreement about _reference_ is relevant to QTI.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I definitely agree with you that if you mean to completely specify one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Eric when you say &quot;I&quot;, then it is almost certain that that Eric will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; die in one of these dangerous situations.  But let's now specify TWO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Erics:  Eric01 and Eric02.  They are indistinguishable from each other,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and indeed their universes are identical, save for a tiny fluctuation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which will miraculously save Eric02's life tomorrow, but doom Eric01.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If Eric01 and Eric02 mean the same thing when they refer to &quot;I&quot; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instant before the death-event, then that &quot;I&quot; is going to survive, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though Eric01 does not.  If they refer to different things, then there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no question of &quot;I&quot; surviving; it is simply the case that Eric01 dies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Eric02 lives.  Let me stress that I do not think anything like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Eric01 and Eric02 'share' a 'consciousness' that reaches between their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes&quot;.  It's simply that if there is no way for Eric01 to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that he is Eric01 rather than Eric02, then there is no difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between them with respect to their consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />I don't quite agree with your point of view, and the reason is maybe
<br />
similar to our disagreement in my statement: &quot;It is not useful to talk
<br />
about 1st person experiences in 3rd person terms, since when we do
<br />
that we lose the very thing that we want to study.&quot;
<br />
You are trying to identify ' me ' by somehowpointing it out from the pool
<br />
of similar entities in a God's perspective. That may be even impossible,
<br />
if there is no God, but that is another discussion. The thing is that I find
<br />
it misleading anyway. I don't need to point out who ' I ' am. I am
<br />
concerned with my first-person experiences, and that is easy to
<br />
determine without even gaining acces to the other entities who look like
<br />
me. ' I ' am what I experience myself to be, and that is a completely
<br />
specified entity since there are no interactions between universes.
<br />
<br />If two universes have any distinction, even in the state of a particle, as
<br />
I understand the MWI, they are distinct universes. That is an objective
<br />
statement, which has nothing to do with my lack of knowledge about
<br />
the small differences. One particular universe (the one  ' I ' am in) may
<br />
have distinct outcomes in a dangerous situation, so that it splits in, say,
<br />
50% universes where I am dead, and 50% where I am alive. Since, in
<br />
a materialistic position, ' I ' am the experiences of one of these bodies, I
<br />
will be dead in 50% of them.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; A particular atom interacts with the atoms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or other particles in its universe only (interference is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interaction).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Therefore a set of atoms do the same. All experience comes from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; interactons that take place in a particular universe. There are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a set of universes so similar that cannot be told apart. But after any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; event (like a particle's interaction with another, or someone's death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; a larger scale) these universes have decohered enough so that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot equalize them anymore.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, they have decohered with respect to some events.  But if this &quot;no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cul-de-sac conjecture&quot; holds, then there must be some events that still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can happen, with respect to which some set of universes has not yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decohered, that would lead at least one member of an &quot;I&quot;-continuum away
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the danger.  I am not sure I understand why some say it must hold,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I'm going through the archives..
</em><br />
<br />Surely some member of this continuum will survive, but what I sustain is
<br />
that the probability that I see this survival is calculated in the same way
<br />
than the probability of any other event, since my body is not absent in the
<br />
worlds where I am dead, it is simply dead.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I think that when people respond to this question they forget the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumption that I am making and argue assuming other philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; framework.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope I've clarified the issue on this regard.. with the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you made, you are right, that almost all the completely specified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entities die.  But I think for this assumption to be meaningful you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must actually be capable of making those specifications.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry to complicate things by introducing Eric01 and 02, etc.. these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; posts have a way of becoming long and unreadable, and I can't follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the messages in this whole thread.  But thanks for having a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion.
</em><br />
<br />No problem, it is surely a nice discussion.
<br />
<br />-Eric.
