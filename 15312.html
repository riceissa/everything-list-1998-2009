<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, my personal answer would take into account the fact that I

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already have a problem with the materialist's idea of &quot;matter&quot;. But I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think we're supposed to be considering the question in the context of

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism and materialism. So I'll ask, what should a mechanist-

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialist say about the state of Alice's consciousness during the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exam?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe I'm jumping ahead, but I think this thought experiment creates a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dilemma for the mechanist-materialist (which I think is Bruno's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point). In contrast to many of the other responses in this thread, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't think the mechanist-materialist should believe that Alice is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious in the case when every gate has stopped functioning (but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmic rays are randomly causing them to flip in the exact same way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they would have flipped if they were functioning). Alice is in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that case functionally identical to a random-number generator. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shouldn't matter at all whether these cosmic rays are striking the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; broken gates in her head, or if the gates in her head are completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inert and the rays are striking the neurons in (say) her arms and her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spinal chord, still causing her body to behave exactly as it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have without the breakdown. I agree with Telmo Menezes that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanist-materialist shouldn't view Alice as conscious in the latter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case. But I don't think it's any different than the former case.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am afraid you are already too much suspect of the contradictory  
<br />
nature of MEC+MAT.
<br />
Take the reasoning has a game. Try to keep both MEC and MAT, the game  
<br />
consists in showing the more clearly as possible what will go wrong.  
<br />
The goal is to help the other to understand, or to find an error  
<br />
(fatal or fixable: in both case we learn).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It sounds like many people are under the impression that mechanism-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialism, with it's rejection of zombies, is committed to the view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Lucky Alice must be conscious, because she's behaviorally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indistinguishable from the Alice with the correctly-functioning brain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But, in the sense that matters, Lucky Alice is *not* behaviorally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indistinguishable from fully-functional Alice.
</em><br />
<br />You mean the ALICE of Telmo's solution of MGA 1bis, I guess. The  
<br />
original Alice, well I mean the one in MGA 1, is functionally  
<br />
identical at the right level of description (actually she has already  
<br />
digital brain). The physical instantiation of a computation is  
<br />
completely realized. No neurons can &quot;know&quot; that the info (correct and  
<br />
at the right places) does not come from the relevant neurons, but from  
<br />
a lucky beam.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the mechanist-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialist, everything physical counts as &quot;behavior&quot;. And there is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clear physical difference between the two Alices, which would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physically discoverable by a nearby scientist with the proper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instruments.
</em><br />
<br />But the physical difference does not play a role. If you invoke it,  
<br />
how could you accept saying yes to a doctor, who introduce bigger  
<br />
difference?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lets imagine that, during the time that Alice's brain is broken but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;luckily&quot; acting as though it wasn't due to cosmic rays, someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; throws a ball at Alice's head, and she (&quot;luckily&quot;) ducks out of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way. The mechanist-materialist may be happy to agree that she did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indeed &quot;duck out of the way&quot;, since that's just a description of what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; her body did.
</em><br />
<br />OK, for both ALICE of Telmo's solution of MGA 1bis, and ALICE MGA 1.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the mechanist-materialist can (and must) claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lucky Alice did not in fact respond to the ball at all.
</em><br />
<br />Consciously or privately? Certainly not for ALICE  MGA 1bis. But why  
<br />
not for ALICE MGA 1? Please remember to try to naively, or candidly  
<br />
enough, keep both  MECH and MAT in mind. You are already reasoning  
<br />
like if we were concluding some definitive things, biut we are just  
<br />
trying to build an argument. In the end, you will say: I knew it, but  
<br />
the point is helping the others to &quot;know&quot; it too. Many here have  
<br />
already the good intuition I think. The point is to make that  
<br />
intuition the most communicable possible.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement can be translated into pure physics-talk. The movements of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alice's body in this case are being caused by the cosmic rays. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are causally disconnected from the movements of the ball (except in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the incidental way that the ball might be having some causal effect on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cosmic rays).
</em><br />
<br /><br />More on this after MGA 2. Hopefully tomorrow.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When Alice's brain is working properly, her act of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ducking *is* causally connected to the movement of the ball. And this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind of causal connection is an important part of what the mechanist-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; materialist means by &quot;consciousness&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Careful:  such kind of causality needs ... MAT.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dennett is able to - and in fact must - say that Alice is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious when all of her brain-gates are broken but very luckily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being flipped by cosmic rays. When Dennett says that someone is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious, he is referring precisely to these behavioral competences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that can be described in physical terms.
</em><br />
<br />You see.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; He means that this collection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of physical stuff we call Alice really is responding to her immediate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environment (like the ball), observing things, collecting data, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that very objective sense, Lucky Alice is not responding to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ball at all. She's not conscious by Dennett's physicalist definition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of consciousness. But she's also not a zombie, because she is behaving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently than fully-functional Alice. You just have to be able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have the proper instruments to know it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you still think that Dennett would claim that Lucky Alice is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; zombie, take a look at this quote from <a href="http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/zombic.htm">http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/papers/zombic.htm</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  : &quot;Just remember, by definition, a zombie behaves indistinguishably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from a conscious being–in all possible tests, including not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answers to questions [as in the Turing test] but psychophysical tests,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neurophysiological tests–all tests that any 'third-person' science can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; devise.&quot; Lucky Alice does *not* behave indistinguishably from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious being in all possible tests.
</em><br />
<br />By definition, I would say, she does. Of course, this makes sense,  
<br />
with MECH only above the substitution level. But at that level, a  
<br />
neurophysiologist looking in the detail would see the neurons doing  
<br />
their job. Only, he will also see, some neurons breaking down, and  
<br />
then being fixed, not by an internal biological fixing mechanism (like  
<br />
it occurs all the time in biological system, but by a lucky beam, but  
<br />
despite this, and thanks to this, the brain of Alice (MGA 1) does the  
<br />
entire normal usual work. If not, you introduce a kind of magic, which  
<br />
if existing, would prevent me to say yes to any doctor.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The proper third-person test
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; examining her logic gates would show that she is not responding to her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediate environment at all. Dennett should claim that she's a non-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious non-zombie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nevertheless, I think Bruno's thought experiment causes a problem for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mechanist-materialist, as it is supposed to. If we believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fully-functional Alice is conscious and the random-gate-brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alice is not conscious, what happens when we start turning Alice's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functioning brain-gates one-at-a-time into random brain gates (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they luckily keep flipping the way they would have)? Alice's deep
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior changes - she gradually stops responding to her environment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; although her outward behavior makes it look like she still does - but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clearly there's nothing within Alice &quot;noticing&quot; the change. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly can't imagine (as Searle wants to) that Alice is internally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; feeling her consciousness slip away, but is powerless to cry out, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's tempting to say that this argument simply shows us that Lucky
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Alice must be conscious after all, but that's just the other horn of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the dilemma. The mechanist-materialist can only talk about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in computational / physical terms. For Dennett, if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that Alice is &quot;aware&quot;, you must be able to translate this into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanistic terms. And I can't see any mechanistic sense in which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lucky Alice can be said to be &quot;aware&quot; of anything.
</em><br />
<br />Alice MGA 1 can be said to be aware in the roiginal mechanist sense.  
<br />
When she thought &quot;Oh the math problem is easy&quot;, she trigged the right  
<br />
memories in her brain, with the correct physical activity, even if  
<br />
just luckily in that case.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I prefer to just say that Bruno's thought experiment shows that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's something wrong with mechanism-materialism, but it's not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious (yet) what the solution is.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And things will even be more confusing after MGA 2, but that's the  
<br />
goal. MEC + MAT should give a contradiction, we will extract some  
<br />
weirder and weirder proposition until the contradiction will be  
<br />
utterly clear. OK?
<br />
<br />Bruno
