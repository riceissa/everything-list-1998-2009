<br />Nope, just a bit polemic. I was getting tired of glib assertions, and needed

to poke a stick, to find out what's underneath.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is a justification of why I think arithmetical realism is at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very plausible...
</em><br />
<br />I'm all ears.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's suppose that a computer simulation can (in principle) exhibit

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; awareness.  I don't know whether you dispute this hypothesis, but let's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume it and see where it leads.
</em><br />
<br />With you so far. We already have simulated critters with behaviour, and
<br />
awareness of their environment. Computational neuroscience even attempts to
<br />
do it with a high degree of biological realism.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's suppose in fact that you Eugin,  were able to watch a computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation run, and on the screen you could see &quot;people&quot; laughing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; talking - perhaps even discussing ideas like whether *their* physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence needs to be postulated, or else they are merely part of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic multiverse.  A simulated person may stamp his fist on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulated coffee table and say &quot;Surely this coffee table is real - how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could it possibly be numbers - I've never heard of anything so
</em><br />
<br />That wouldn't be abstract &quot;numbers&quot;. You'd have a system with a state, evolving
<br />
along a trajectory. In your case, that system state is being rendered (in
<br />
realtime, I presume) for external observers.
<br />
<br />You'd be a bit pressed to enumerate all possible system trajectories, though.
<br />
You'd run out of time and space even for very, very small assemblies.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ludicrous!&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now Eugin, you may argue that the existence of this universe depends on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that it was simulated by a computer in our universe.  I find
</em><br />
<br />Exactly. No implementation, no state, no trajectory. Information doesn't
<br />
exist without systems encoding it. (This applies to this universe being the
<br />
metalayer for a simulated system; I don't make any assumptions about our own
<br />
metalayer, which is pretty meaningless, since unknowable unless).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; this a little hard to fathom - because computer simulations are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deterministic and they give the same results whether they are run once
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or a thousand times.  I find it hard to imagine that they &quot;leap into
</em><br />
<br />Absolutely. Provided, they're run. (In practice, you'll see system running
<br />
floats are not as deterministic as you think). 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence&quot; when they are run the first time.   I'm particularly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; motivated by the universal dove-tailing program - which eventually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generates the trace of all possible programs.
</em><br />
<br />I don't deny that this universe exists. I do deny that the metalayers is
<br />
knowable in principle, provided that metalayers is not operated by
<br />
cooperating beings (which is a very purple requirement).
<br />
<br />What I *am* interested in is a simple TOE, or a set of simple equivalent
<br />
TOEs, which has enough predictive power to be usable with some finite amount
<br />
of computation.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you say that most of the integers don't exist because nobody has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written them down?
</em><br />
<br />Yeah. I'm saying that, say,
<br />
0xf2f75022aa10b5ef6c69f2f59f34b03e26cb5bdb467eec82780c2ccdf0c8e100d38f20d9f3064aea3fba00e723a5c7392fba0ac0c538a2c43706fdb7f7e58259
<br />
didn't exist in this universe (with a very high probability, it being a 512
<br />
bit number, generated from physical system noise) before I've generated it.
<br />
Now it exists (currently, as a hex string (not necessarily ASCII) on many systems 
<br />
around the world, rendered in diverse fonts), as soon as I remove all 
<br />
its encodings it's gone again. P00f!
<br />
<br />Ditto applies to generator systems -- they're a bit more widespread within a
<br />
lightday from here (though most of them are concentrated within a fraction of
<br />
a lightsecond), but you take them out -- all of them -- numbers cease to exist. 
<br />
They're gone, until something else comes along, and reinvents them.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can see your point when you say that 2+2=4 is meaningless without the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physical objects&quot; to which it relates.  However this is irrelevant
</em><br />
<br />No, they're meaningful without observers with world models. The physical objects (unless
<br />
they're infoprocessing systems) can't observe themselves.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; because you are thinking of too simplistic a mathematical system!  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only mathematical systems that are relevant to the everything-list are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those that have conscious inhabitants within them.  Within this &quot;self
</em><br />
<br />I don't know what &quot;conscious&quot; means, but machine vision systems and animals can sure
<br />
count. No need to use vis vitalis for that.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; contained&quot; mathematical world we *do* have the context for numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's a bit like the chicken and egg problem.  (egg = number theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chicken = objects and observers).   Both come together and can't be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pulled apart.
</em><br />
<br />You're anthopomorphising awfully. It sure nice to be a conscious observers,
<br />
but most parts of this universe have been doing fine without, and given
<br />
that multiverse exists, most of those seem to do without as well.
