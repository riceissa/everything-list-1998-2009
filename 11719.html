An excellent essay.  I agree with almost everything you wrote; and you put it very well.  Would you mind if I cross posted it to Vic Stenger's AVOID-L mailing list.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why Mathematics Works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    1. Mathematics is the theoretical exploration of every possible kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of abstract structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    2. The world has some kind of structure; it is not chaos or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; featureless or void
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    3. Therefore, it is likely that at least some of the structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discovered by mathematicians are applicable to the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (It would be strange if everything mathematicans came up with was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirically applicable, and might tend one towards Platonism or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rationalism, but this is not the case. It might be possible for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicians working completely abstractly and theoretically to fail
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to include any empirically useful structures in the finite list of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures so far achieved, but maths is not divorced from empiricism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and practicallity to that extent -- what I say in (1) is something of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an idealisation).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Six Approaches to the Philosophy of Mathematics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Approach 1: Empiricism: The &quot;maths is physics&quot; theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Approach 2: Platonism: Objectivity and objects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Approach 3: Psychologism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Approach 4: Formalism: Mathematics as a game.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Approach 5: Constructivism: How Real Are The Real Numbers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Approach 6: Quasi Empiricism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Approach 1: Empiricism: The &quot;maths is physics&quot; theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical empiricism is undermined by developments since the 19th
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; century, of forms of mathematics with no obvious physical application,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such an non-Euclidean geometry. I should probably say no obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; application at the time since non-Euclidean geometery -- or curved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; space -- was utilised in Einstein's General Theory of Relativity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsequent to its development by mathematicians. So M.E. has two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems: the existence of mathematical structures with no (currently)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious physical application, and the fact that the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applicability of different areas of mathematics varies with time,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depending on discoveries in physics. Todays mathematical game-playing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may be tomorrow's hard reality. It is also undermined by mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; method, the fact that maths is a chalk-and-blackboard (or just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking) activity, not a laboratory activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Approach 2: Platonism: Objectivity and objects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both Platonism and Empiricism share the assumption that mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols refer to objects. (And some people feel they have to believe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Empiricism simply because Platonism is so unacceptable). Platonism gets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its force from noting the robustness and fixity of mathematical truths,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are often described as &quot;eternal&quot;. The reasoning seems to be that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if the truth of a statement is fixed, it must be fixed by something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external to itself. In other words, mathematical truths msut be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discovered, because if they were made they could have be made
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differently, and so would not be fixed and eternal. But there is no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason to think that these two metaphors --&quot;discovering&quot; and &quot;making&quot;--
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are the only options. Perhaps the modus operandi of mathematics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unique; perhaps it combines the fixed objectivity of discovering a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical fact about the external world whilst being nonetheless an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internal, non-empirical activity. The Platonic thesis seems more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; obvious than it should because of an ambiguity in the word &quot;objective&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Objective truths amy be truths about real-world objects. Objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truths may also be truths that do not depend on the whims or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preferences of the speaker (unlike statements about the best movie of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flavour of ice-cream). Statements that are objective in the first sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tend to be objective in the second sense, but that does not mean that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all statements that are objective in the second sense need be objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the first sense. They may fail to depend on individual whims and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preferences without depending on anything external to the mind.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Approach3: Formalism: Mathematics as a game.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both Platonism and Empriricism share the assumption that mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symbols refer to objects. An alternative to both is the theory that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they do not refer at all: this theory is called formalism. For the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formalist, mathematical truths are fixed by the rules of mathematics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not by external objects. But what fixes the rules of mathematics ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Formalism suggests that mathematics is a meaningless game, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules can be defined any way we like. Yet mathematicians in practice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are careful about the selection of axioms, not arbitrary. So do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rules and axioms of mathematics mean anything or not ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reader may or may not have noticed that I have been talking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical symbols &quot;referring&quot; to things rather than &quot;meaning&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things. This eliptically refers to a distinction between two different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kinds or shades of meaning made by Frege. &quot;Reference&quot; is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external-world object a symbol is &quot;about&quot;. &quot;Sense&quot; is the kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning a symbol has even if does not have a reference. Thus statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about unicorns or the bald King of France have Sense but not Reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus it is possible for mathematical statments to have a sense, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore a meaning, beyond the formal rules and defintions, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stopping short of external objects (referents), whether physical or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonic. This position retains the negative claim of Formalism, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical symbols don't refer to objects, and thus avoids the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pitfalls of both Platonism and Empiricism. Howeverm it allows that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical symbols can have meanings of an in-the-head kind and thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explains the non-arbitrary nature of the choice of axioms; they are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary because they must correspond to the mathematician's intuition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- her &quot;sense&quot; -- of what a real number or a set is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So far we have been assuming that the same answer must apply uniformly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to all mathematical statmentents and symbols: they all refer or none
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do. There is a fourth option: divide and conquer -- some refer and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Approach 4: Psychologism: Nubers are Concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Psychologism is the view that mathematical propositions are &quot;about&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas. (As opposed to physical objects, or Platonic objects) The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterargument is that there are inifinities in maths, but we do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have infinite numbers of ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All of these theories assume mathematical statements must refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something, and all can be undercut by the hypothesis that mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements can get by purely on &quot;sense&quot; and do not need &quot;reference&quot; at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all (the sense/reference distinction is Frege's). So the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Counter-counter argument is: we can have an idea of infinity without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having an infinite number if ideas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;A fourth and final version of the third strategy, developed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Balaguer (1995, 1998) (and see Linsky and Zalta (1995) for a related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view), is based upon the adoption of a particular version of platonism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that can be called plenitudinous platonism, or as Balaguer calls it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; full-blooded platonism (FBP). FBP can be intuitively but sloppily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expressed with the slogan, 'All possible mathematical objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist'; more precisely, the view is that all the mathematical objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that possibly could exist actually do exist, or that there exist as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many mathematical objects as there possibly could. Balaguer argues that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if platonists endorse FBP, then they can solve the epistemological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem with their view without positing any sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information-transferring contact between human beings and abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects. For since FBP says that all possible mathematical objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist, it follows that if FBP is true, then every purely mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory that could possibly be true (i.e., that's internally consistent)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accurately describes some collection of actually existing mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects. Thus, it follows from FBP that in order to attain knowledge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract mathematical objects, all we have to do is come up with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; internally consistent purely mathematical theory (and know that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consistent). But it seems clear that (i) we humans are capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulating internally consistent mathematical theories (and of knowing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they're internally consistent), and (ii) being able to do this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not require us to have any sort of information-transferring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contact with the abstract objects that the theories in question are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about. Thus, if this is right, then the epistemological problem with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonism has been solved.&quot;

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/#2">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/#2</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not really, because there is now no role for Platonic objects. They are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not involved in the actual process of verifying the truth of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical claims. A daemon could wish Platonia and all its contents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; away, and nothing would change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Approach 5: Constructivism: How Real Are The Real Numbers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical Platonism is the view that mathematical objects exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some sense (not necessarily the sense that physical objects exist),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; irrespective of our ability to display or prove them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Constructivism is an opposing view, according to which only objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which can be explicitly shown or proven exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some constructivists believe in constructivism as an end in itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Others use it as a means to an end,namely the elimination of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Real numbers (numbers which cannot be expressed in a finite number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digits) are a particular problem for both kinds of constructivist. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the first, because most real numbers cannot be shown. Some are well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; known, such as pi and e (the base of natural logarithms). These can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generated by an algorithm; a sort of mathematical machine, where if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep turning the handle, it keeps churning out digits. Of course, real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers are not a finite string of digits, so the process never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finishes. Nonetheless, the fact that the algorithm itself is finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gives us a handle on the real number, an ability to grasp it. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real number line is dense, so between any of these well known real
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers are infinities of intransigent real numbers, whose digits form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no pattern, and which therefore cannot be set out, either as a string
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of digits, or as an algorithm.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or, at least, so the Platonists would have it. What alternatives are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; available for the constructuvist ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * 1. All numbers are equally (ontologically) real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * 2. The accessible real numbers (the transcendental numbers) are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (ontologically) real, and the other (mathematically) &quot;real&quot; numbers are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * 3. No (mathematically) real number is (ontologically) real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. is the position constructivists are trying to get away from. 3 is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hardly tenable, since some irrational numbers, such as pi, *can* be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructed. And (2) contradicts the idea of density -- it suggests the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real number line has gaps. Moreover, something like the requirment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; denstity can be asserted without making any strong ontological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commitments towards the reality of the real number line.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Approach 6: Quasi Empiricism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A number of recent developments in mathematics, such as the increased
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use of computers to assist proof, and doubts about the correct choice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of basic axioms, have given rise to a view called quasi-empiricism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This challenges the traditional idea of mathematical truth as eternal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and discoverable apriori. According to quasi-empiricists the use of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer to perform a proof is a form of experiment. But it remains the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case that any mathematical problem that can in principle be solved by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shutting you eye and thinking. Computers are used because mathematians
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not have infinite mental resources; they are an aid. Contrast this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with traditonal sciences like chemistry or biology, where real-world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects have to be studied, and would still have to be studied by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; super-scientitists with an IQ of a million. In genuinely emprical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sciences, experimentation and observation are used to gain information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In mathematics the information of the solution to a problem is always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latent in the starting-point, the basic axioms and the formulation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problem. The process of thinking through a problem simply makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this latent information explicit. (I say simply, but of ocurse it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; often very non-trivial). The use of a computer externalises this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process. The computer may be outside the mathematician's head but all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the information that comes out of it is information that went into it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematics is in that sense still apriori.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having said that, the quasi-empricist still has some points about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modern style of mathematics. Axioms look less like eternal truths and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more like hypotheses which are used for a while but may eventualy be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discarded if they prove problematical, like the role of scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypotheses in Popper's philosophy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus mathematics has some of the look and feel of empirical science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without being empirical in the most essential sense -- that of needing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an input of information from outside the head.&quot;Quasi&quot; indeed!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penrose on Platonism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;our individual minds are notoriously imprecise, unreliable and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent in their judgements&quot; TBD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So when we do maths we are not using our minds, but something else? Or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe we are just using our minds in disciplined way -- after all, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discipline of maths has to be painfully learnt. TBD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Does this not point to something outside ourselves with a reality that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lies beyond what each individual can achieve?&quot; TBD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is achieved by individuals is achieved by individuals. How can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some transcendent realm speak through the mouth of an individual? TBD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Nevertheless, one might take the alternative view that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical world has no independent existence, and consists of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain ideas which have been distilled from our various minds, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which have found to be totally trustworthy, and are 'agreed by all',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for example, or 'agreed by those in their right mind's, or 'agreed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those who have a PhD in mathematics' (not much use in Plato's day), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who have a right to venture an authoratiative opinion&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which mathematical world? The world of mathematics so far proven and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understood, or the world that is waiting to be explored? However few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicians there are, there is no contradiction that they carry the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world of known mathematics around in their heads. The fewer there are,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the less there is to carry round. Perhaps Penrose thinks they must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carry the whole Platonic world around to act as a &quot;standard&quot;, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical proof doesn't work by direct inspection of Platonia, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; works slowly and painfully by axioms and deductions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;There seems to be a danger of circularity here; for to judge whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone is in his or her right mind requires some external standard&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; External to them, yes...but when we make such judgements, we ue finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and earthly resources. The idea that Platonia provides a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once-and-for-all absolute standard is not of much use unless it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explained how the standard is applied. The actual standard against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which a proposed arguemnt is tested involves the community of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicians checking it with their flawed and finite minds. Platonia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might provide a higher standard, but it is not one anyone has ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succeeded in employing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;What I mean by this existence is really just the objectivity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical truth&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And what does thatmean? Existence is existence, truth is truth. People
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who disbelieve in Platonism can still believe in the objectivity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonism and Causation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maths has no causal effect on the mind in the sense of an event in time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; causing a subsequent one. Arguably, there are other forms of causation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arguably the laws of the universe &quot;cause&quot; events in the sense that if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they were different, events would be different. Can the same argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be applied to mathematical truth? The problem is that mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth is logically necessary -- it could not have been different!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Is the Brain A Machine?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; John Searle thinks so . Is he right ? To give a typically philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answer, that depends on what you mean by 'machine'. If 'machine' means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an artificial construct, then the answer is obviously 'no'. However.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Searle also thinks the the body is a machine, by which he seems to mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it has been understand in scientific terms, we can explain biology
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by in terms of to chemistry and chemistry in terms of physics. Is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain a machine by this definition ? The problem is that the job of he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain is to implement a conscious mind, just as the job of the stomach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is to digest. The problem is that although our 'mechanical'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of the stomach does allow us to understand digestion we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not, according to Searle himself, understand how the brain produces
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. He does think that the problem of consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientifically explicable, so yet another definition of 'machine' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed, namely 'scientifically explained or scientifically explicable'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- with the brain being explicable rather than explained. The problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with this stretch-to-fit approach to the meaning of the word 'machine'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that every time the definition of brain is broadened, the claim is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weakened, made less impactful.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Chinese Room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to the proponents of Artificial Intelligence, a system is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligent if it can convince a human interlocutor that it is. This is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the famous Turing Test. It focuses on external behaviour and is mute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about how that behaviour is produced. A rival idea is that of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chinese Room, due to John Searle. Searle places himself in the room,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; manually executing a computer algorithm that implements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligent-seeming behaviour, in this case getting questions written
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in Chinese and mechanically producing answers, without himself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding Chinese. He thereby focuses attention on how the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supposedly intelligent behaviour is produced. Although Searle's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original idea was aimed at semantics, my variation is going to focus on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. Likewise, although Searle's original specification has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him implementing complex rules, I am going to take it that the Chinese
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Room is implemented as a conceptually simple system, in line with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorem of CS which has it that any computer can be emulated by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing Machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you think a Chinese Room implemented with a simplistic, &quot;dumb&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithm can still be conscious, you are probably a behaviourist; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only care about that external stimuli get translated into the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate responses, not how this happens, let alone what it feels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to the system in question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you think this dumb Chinese Room is not conscious, but a smart one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be, you need to explain why. Any smart AI can be implemented as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dumb TM, so the more complex inner workings which supposedly implement
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. could be added or subtracted without making any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detectable difference. This seems to add up to epiphenomenalism, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view that consciousness exists but is a bystander that doesn't cause
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you think that complexity makes a difference, so dumb AI's are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitely not conscious, you are probably a (strong) emergentist: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity is of such a nature that it cannot be reduced to a dumb
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithm such as a Turing machine, and is therefore non-computable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (A couple of points: I am talking about strong, Broad-style emergentism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here, according to which the emerging property cannot be usefully
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reduced to something simpler. There is also a weaker sense of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'emergence' in which what emerges is a mere pattern of behaviour, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the way the waves 'emerge' from the sea. This is not quite black-box
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviourism, since some attention is being paid to what goes on inside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the head, inasmuch as the right high-level pattern needs to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produced, but it is closer to behaviourism than to strong, irreducible,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Broad-style emergentism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also: I casually remarked that mental behaviour 'may not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable'. This will shock some AI proponents, for whom the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chuch-Turing thesis proves that everything is computable. More
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precisely, everything that is mathematically computable is computable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a relatively dumb computer, a Turing that something can be simulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't mean the simulation has all the relevant propeties of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original: flight simulators don't take off. Thirdly the mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense of 'computable' doesn't fit well with the idea of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer-simulating fundamental physics. A real number is said to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematically computable if the algorithm that churns it out keeps on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; churning out extra digits of accuracy..indefinitely. Since such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithm will never finish churning out a single real number physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value, it is difficult to see how it could simulate an entire universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I am assuming the universe is fundamentally made of real numbers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If it is, for instance finite, fundamental physics might be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; readily computable, but the computability of physics still depends very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; much on physics and not just on computer science). Peter D Jones 8/6/05

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The objection goes: &quot;But there must be some kind of information

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processing structure that implements meaning in our heads. Surely that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could be turned into rules for the operator of the Chinese Room&quot;.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Circularity Objection: an abstract structure must be circular and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore must fail to have any real semantics. (It is plausible that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any given term can be given an abstract definition that doesn't depend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on direct experience. It is much less plausible that every *term* can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be defined that way. Such a system would be circular in the same way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as: &quot;present: gift&quot; &quot;gift: present&quot; but on a larger scale. If this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument, the Circularity Objection is correct, the practice of giving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract definitions, like &quot;equine quadruped&quot; only works because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhere in the chain of definitions are words that have been defined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly; direct reference has been merely deferred, not avoided
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; altogether.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The objection continues: &quot;But the information processing structure in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our heads has a concrete connection to the real world: so do AI's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (although the CR's are minimal) (This is the Portability Assumption)&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But they are not the *same* concrete connections. The portability of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract rules is guaranteed by the fact that they are abstract. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concrete causal connections are non-abstract, and are prima-facie
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlikely to be portable -- how can you explain colour to an alien whose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; senses do not include anything like vision.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the Circularity Objection is correct, an AI (particularly a robotic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one) could be expected to have *some* semantics, but there is no reason
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it should have *human* semantics. As wittgenstein said: &quot;if a lion

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Artificial Intelligence and Computers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; An AI is not necessarily a computer. Not everything is a computer or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer-emulable. It just needs to be artificial and intelligent! The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extra ingredient a conscious system has need not be anything other than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the physics (chemistry, biology) of its hardware -- there is no forced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choice between ghosts and machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A physical system can never be exactly emulated with different hardware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- the difference has to show up somewhere. It can be hidden by only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dealing with a subset of a systems abilities relevant to the job in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hand; a brass key can open a door as well as an iron key, but brass
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be substituted for iron where magnetism is relevant. Physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differences can also be evaded by taking an abstract view of their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functioning; two digital circuits might be considered equivalent at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;ones and zeros&quot; level of description even though they physically work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at different voltages.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thus computer-emulability is not a property of physical systems as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such. Even if all physical laws are computable, that does not mean that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any physical systems can be fully simulated. The reason is that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level of simulation matters. A simulated plane does not actually fly; a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulated game of chess really is chess. There seems to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinction between things like chess, which can survive being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulated at a higher level of abstraction, and planes, which can't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Moreover, it seems that chess-like things are in minority, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they can be turned into an abstract programme and adequately simulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because they are already abstract.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness. might depend on specific properties of hardware, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter. This does not imply parochialism, the attitude that denies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to poor Mr Data just because he is made out of silicon,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not protoplasm. We know our own brains are conscious; most of us intuit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that rocks and dumb Chinese Rooms are not; all other cases are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; debatable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course all current research in AI is based on computation in one way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or another. If the Searlian idea that consciousness is rooted in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics, strongly emergent, and non-computable is correct, then current
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AI can only achieve consciousness accidentally. A Searlian research
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; project would understand how brains generate consciousness in the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place -- the aptly-named Hard Problem -- before moving onto possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificial reproductions, which would have to have the right kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics and internal causal activity -- although not necessarily the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same kind as humans.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computationalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computationalism is the claim that the human mind is essentially a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer. It can be picturesquely expressed in the &quot;yes, doctor&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis -- the idea that, faced with a terminal disease, you would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consent to having your consciousness downloaded to a computer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are two ambiguities in &quot;computationalism&quot; -- consciousness vs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognition, process vs programme -- leading to a total of four possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meanings.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most people would not say &quot;yes doctor&quot; to a process that recorded their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain on a tape a left it in a filing cabinet. Yet, that is all you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get out of the timeless world of Plato's heaven (programme vs process).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That intuition is, I think, rather stronge than the intuition that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin's argument relies on: that consciousness supervenes only on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain activity, not on counterfactuals.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the other ambiguity in computationalism offers another way out. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only cognition supervenes on computational (and hence counterfactual)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity, then consciousness could supervene on non-counterfactual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity -- i.e they could both supervene on physical processes, but in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different ways.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonic computationalism -- are computers numbers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any computer programme (in a particular computer) is a long sequence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1's and 0's, and therefore, a long number. According to Platonism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers exist immaterially in &quot;Plato's Heaven&quot;. If programmes are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers, does that mean Plato's heaven is populated with computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programmes?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem, as we shall see is the &quot;in a a particular computer&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clause.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As Bruno Marchal states the claim in a more formal language:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Of course I can [identify programmes with numbers ]. This is a key
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point, and it is not obvious. But I can, and the main reason is Church
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thesis (CT). Fix any universal machine, then, by CT, all partial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computable function can be arranged in a recursively enumerable list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, etc. &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course you can count or enumerate machines or algorithms, i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attach unique numerical labels to them. The problem is in your &quot;Fix any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal machine&quot;. Given a string of 1's and 0s wihouta universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine, and you have no idea of which algorithm (non-universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine) it is. Two things are only identical if they have all*their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties in common (Leibniz's law). But none of the propeties of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;machine&quot; are detectable in the number itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (You can also count the even numbers off against the odd numbers , but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that hardly means that even numbers are identical to odd numbers!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;In computer science, a fixed universal machine plays the role of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; coordinate system in geometry. That's all. With Church Thesis, we don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even have to name the particular universal machine, it could be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal cellular automaton (like the game of life), or Python,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Robinson Aritmetic, Matiyasevich Diophantine universal polynomial,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Java, ... rational complex unitary matrices, universal recursive group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or ring, billiard ball, whatever.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ye-e-es. But if all this is taking place in Platonia, the only thing it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be is a number. But that number can't be associated with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computaiton by another machine, or you get infinite regress.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is the computationalist claim trivial -- are all systems computers?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TBD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computational counterfactuals, and the Computational-Platonic Argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for Immaterial Minds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For one, there is the argument that: A computer programme is just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long number, a string of 1's and 0's.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (All) numbers exist Platonically (according to Platonism)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore, all programmes exist Platonically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A mind is special kind of programme (According to computaionalism)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All programmes exist Platonically (previous argument)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore, all possible minds exist Platonically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore, a physical universe is unnecessary -- our minds exist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already in the Platonic realm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The argument has a number of problems even allowing the assumptions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonism, and computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A programme is not the same thing as a process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computationalism refers to real, physical processes running on material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers. Proponents of the argument need to show that the causality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and dynamism are inessential (that there is no relevant difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between process and programme) before you can have consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implemented Platonically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To exist Platonically is to exist eternally and necessarily. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no time or change in Plato's heave. Therefore, to &quot;gain entry&quot;, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational mind will have to be translated from a running process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into something static and acausal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One route is to replace the process with a programme. let's call this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Programme approach.. After all, the programme does specify all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible counterfactual behaviour, and it is basically a string of 1's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 0's, and therefore a suitable occupant of Plato's heaven. But a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specification of counterfactual behaviour is not actual counterfactual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour. The information is the same, but they are not the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No-one would believe that a brain-scan, however detailed, is conscious,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so not computationalist, however ardent, is required to believe that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progamme on a disk, gathering dust on a shelf, is sentient, however
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good a piece of AI code it may be!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another route is &quot;record&quot; the actual behaviour, under some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstances of a process, into a stream of data (ultimately, a string
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of numbers, and therefore something already in Plato's heaven). Let's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; call this the Movie approach. This route loses the conditional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure, the counterfactuals that are vital to computer programmes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and therefore to computationalism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Computer programmes contain conditional (if-then) statements. A given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run of the programme will in general not explore every branch. yet the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexplored branches are part of the programme. A branch of an if-then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statement that is not executed on a particular run of a programme will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constitute a counterfactual, a situation that could have happened but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't. Without counterfactuals you cannot tell which programme
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (algorithm) a process is implementing because two algorithms could have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same execution path but different unexecuted branches.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since a &quot;recording&quot; is not computation as such, the computationalist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need not attribute mentality to it -- it need not have a mind of its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own, any more than the characters in a movie.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Another way of looking at this is via the Turing Test; a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording would never pass a TT since it has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; condiitonal/counterfactual behaviour and therfore cannot answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unexpected questions).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A third approach is make a movie of all possible computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories, and not just one. Let's call thsi the Many-Movie approach.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this case a computation would have to be associated with all related
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branches in order to bring all the counterfactuals (or rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditionals) into a single computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (IOW treating branches individually would fall back into the problems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the Movie approach)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If a computation is associated with all branches, consciousness will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also be according to computationalism. That will bring on a White
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rabbit problem with a vengeance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, it is not that computation cannot be associated with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals in single-universe theories -- in the form of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unrealised possibilities, dispositions and so on. If consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenes on computation , then it supervenes on such counterfactuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too; this amounts to the response to Maudlin's argument in wihch the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicalist abandons the claim that consciousness supervenes on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of ocurse, unactualised possibilities in a single universe are never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to lead to any White Rabbits!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing and Other Machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Turing machines are the classical model of computation, but it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doubtful whether they are the best model for human (or other organic)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligence. Turing machines take a fixed input, take as much time as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary to calculate a result, and produce a perfect result (in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases, they will carry on refining a result forever). Biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; survival is all about coming up with good-enough answers to a tight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; timescale. Mistaking a shadow for a sabre-tooth tiger is a msitake, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is more accpetable than standing stock still calculating the perfect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation of your visual information, only to ge eaten. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't put natural cognition beyone the bounds of computation, but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does mean that the Turing Machine is not the ideal model. Biological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systems are more like real time systems, which have to &quot;keep up&quot; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external events, at the expense of doing some things imprefectly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time and Causality in Physics and Computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The sum total of all the positions of particles of matter specififies a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (classical) physical state, but not how the state evolves. Thus it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems that the universe cannot be built out of 0-width (in temporal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms) slices alone. Physics needs to appeal to something else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is one dualistic and two monistic solutions to this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The dualistic solution is that the universe consists (separately) of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; states+the laws of universe. It is like a computer, where the data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (state) evolves according to the programme (laws).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One of the monistic solutions is to put more information into states.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Physics has an age old &quot;cheat&quot; of &quot;instantaneous velocities&quot;. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gives more information about how the state will evolve. But the state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no longer 0-width, it is infinitessimal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another example of states-without-laws is Julian Barbour's Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Full Newtonian mechanics cannot be recovered from his &quot;Machian&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach, but he thinks that what is lost (universes with overall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rotation and movement) is no loss.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other dualistic solution is the opposite of the second:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laws-without-states. For instance, Stephen Hawking's No Boundary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conditions proposal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin's Argument and Counterfactuals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have already mentioned a parallel with computation. There is also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevance to Tim Maudlin's claim that computationalism is incompatible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with physicalism. His argument hinges on serparating the activity of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comptuaitonal system from its causal dispositions. Consciousness, says
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maudlin supervened on activity alone. Parts of an AI mechansim that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not triggered into activity can be disabled without changing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. However, such disabling changes the comutation being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performed, because programmes containt if-then statements only one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branch of which can be executed at a time. The other branch is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;counterfactual&quot;, as situationthat could have happened but didn't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nonetheless, these counterfactuals are part of the algorithm. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing the algorithm doesn't change the conscious state (because it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only supervenes on the active parts of the process, not the unrealised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterfactuals), consciousness does not supervene on computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, If causal dispositions are inextricably part of a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; state, you can't separate activity from counterfactuals. Maudlin's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument would then have to rely on disabling counterfactuals of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; specifically computational sort.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We earlier stated that the dualistic solution is like the separation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between programme and data in a (conventional) computer programme.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, AI-type programmes are typified by the fact that there is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a barrier between code and programme -- AI software is self-modifying,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so it is its own data. Just as it is not physically necessary that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a clear distinction between states and laws (and thus a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; separability of phsycial counterfactuals), so it isn't necessarily the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case that there is a clear distinciton between programme and data, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thus a separability of computational counterfactuals. PDJ 19/8/06

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mysticism: Is Anything Knowable?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Based on a Dialogue with Bill Snyder)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Thinking about existence is quite other than existence itself. There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no such thing as &quot;concrete&quot; thinking; thinking always deals in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstractions and, hence, cannot contain existence itself&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, when you think about rocks, you don't have rocks in the head. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does that put you at a disadvantage?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Thinking of rocks and being a rock are very different activities, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more broadly thinking about existence and existence itself are very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different activities&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is true, but it does not show there is anything missing from our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking. If there is nothing it is like to be a rock. there is nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to stop us grasping all there is to know about rock-ness from our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-rock persepective.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, we feel that we ourselves have inner thoughts and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (especially) feelings that cannot be understood by others, and we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assume others do, even bats, as in the famous paper by Thomas Nagel.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (More here). But the claim that is being examined language and thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are necessarily limited when it comes to grasping the world -- not that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are possibly limited depending on the nature of the world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is logically possible, if coutnerintuitive, that there something it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is like to be a rock, or anything else , and if so, there is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we will never know about anything. This is the conclusion being sought,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but it is far from a necessary truth, only a possibility.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But if there is something it is like to be a rock,. that is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metaphysical fact: the point being that we cannot discover the limits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of thought from the nature of thought alone.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;As for being able to describe something (event or thing or whatever),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being able to refer to it is irrelevant. Referring to the keyboard on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I am typing (I just did it) is not to describe it. Describing it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be to state its colors, shape, and things like that. But to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we must use words which have no precise meaning&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Words only need to be precise enough to pick one thing out form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another. It is probably overkill to describe every last atom.(But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again, that is as much about what the world is like as the limitations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of langauge).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;To put my point broadly, describing perceptual objects is never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely possible, but only approximative because we use abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts in the making of our description (like words which refer to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shape and color). When one comes to the objects of wholly abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought such as the &quot;objects&quot; referred to in advanced scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories, then one is living in a dream world if one thinks that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can describe them or that the theory in question describes them&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a rather different issue. The objects of fundamental science
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tend to be quite simple. The problem is not one of information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overload, is the lack of familir reference-points. (Reference *does*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The language used to refer to the objects MAY invite or suggest a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain descriptive content, but it is more MISleading than helpful in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing so. Calling an electron a particle may suggest that it is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tiny hard little grain of sand like thing. But as we have come to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is a very misleading way of thinking about it&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, the real description is mathematical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;It can just as well be thought of as a field or a wave; when thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of as a field, it is a field which at times generates particle like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behavior and at other times wavelike behavior and at other times
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neither&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The verbal descriptions are unified mathematically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;If QM is correct, its maths describes electrons completely. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no hinterlan of additonal detail -- electrons have no 'hair'&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Language necessarily uses abstractions even in the description of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptual objects. When one is dealing with scientific language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (certainly in the advanced physical sciences) one is dealing with only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstractions&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In what sense of &quot;abstraction&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * The sense that fails to capture what-it-is to-be-like a thing?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * The sense of omitted detail?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * Or the sense of abstruse mathematics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The salient point is whether the thing described has any kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hinterland which is left undescribed by the language employed. That is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; almost always the case with ordinary-langauge descriptions of everyday
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects containing billions and billions of atoms -- but we only know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that to be the case because of the success of scientific descriptions!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It could be argued by analogy that just as the atom-by-atom picture is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; left undescribed by the ordinarys term &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;tree&quot;, so there might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a further hinterland behind the scientific explanation. But that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only a &quot;maybe&quot;, not necessity, and as usual, metaphysics, the nature of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world, is involved.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;when one attempts to connect those abstractions with features drawn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the perceptual world and thereby to &quot;describe&quot; the objects, one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only bamboozles any possibility of undertanding what is being referred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There a various kinds of potential problem depending on the language
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being used, and on what it is being used to describe. Lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding or communication is certainly possible, but is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foregone conclusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Therefore, as long as one operates wholly within the conceptual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure one has no chance in hell of getting hold of existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this is case of being bewitched by language -- specifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being misled by a very unforced choice of metaphor. One is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally encased by ones own beliefs. The whole point of a concept is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to refer to things other than itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does &quot;getting hold&quot; mean? As we have seen, knowing things from a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; third-personse, second-hand, arm-length perspective does not by itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imply that one is at a cognitve disadvantage. It depends on the thing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being understood.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;There are people who appear to me to operate wholly within one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptual structure or another and live caged within their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thoughts, confusing what they think the world to be with existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They may, as individuals be representing things incorrectly (insofars
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as they can be represented correctly). Or they may suffer from a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; genreral problem of being out of contact with reality. Of course, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the general problem obtains in a strong way -- if philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scepticism is true -- there is probably not much difference between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individuals. Everybody is equally wrong and right. (This is the classic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;error&quot; argument against solipsism).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;But existence itself is necessarily beyond any thinking or conceiving&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no necessity to it at all. How knowable a thing is depends on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what it is and how you intend to know it.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mysticism II: the Unreality of Real Things, and the 3-Level View of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Some forms of mysticism claim that everything is a mystery to us, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we do not really know anything. Others claim that the problem lies in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things themselves, that they lack reality rather than knowability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is presumably some sense in which horses exist and unicorns do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not. Thus the claim about the unreality of &quot;conventional objects&quot; seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to imply that they fall short of some higher standard. Is it a purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theoretical standard, or does it imply that there is some higher,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transcedent reality , beyond conventional or empirical objects?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A commmon-sense thinker might well claim that in the absence of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrable higher reality, conventional existence is existence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simpliciter, and the objects we conventionally take to be real are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A famous proponent of this view was the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; His philosophy was critical in nature, enabling him to establish the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;nothing exists&quot; claim using their ready-made criteria for existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the philosophers he was criticising.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mechanism, Organism and Knowability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sceptical arguments often confuse being unable to know anything with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being unable to know everything. But is that really a confusion? It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (logically) possible that things could be so constituted that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature of every thing is intintimately dependent on the nature of every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other thing. This is illustrated by an old parable called the &quot;net of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indra&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     FAR AWAY IN THE HEAVENLY ABODE OF THE GREAT GOD INDRA, THERE IS A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WONDERFUL NET WHICH HAS BEEN HUNG BY SOME CUNNING ARTIFICER IN SUCH A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MANNER THAT IT STRETCHES OUT INDEFINITELY IN ALL DIRECTIONS. IN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXTRAVAGANT TASTES OF DEITIES, THE ARTIFICER HAS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; HUNG A SINGLE GLITTERING JEWEL AT THE NET'S EVERY NODE, AND SINCE THE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NET ITSELF IS INFINITE IN DIMENSION, THE JEWELS ARE INFINITE IN NUMBER.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THERE HANG THE JEWELS, GLITTERING LIKE STARS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE, A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WONDERFUL SIGHT TO BEHOLD. IF WE NOW ARBITRARILY SELECT ONE OF THESE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; JEWELS FOR INSPECTION AND LOOK CLOSELY AT IT, WE WILL DISCOVER THAT IN
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ITS POLISHED SURFACE THERE ARE REFLECTED ALL THE OTHER JEWELS IN THE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; NET, INFINITE IN NUMBER. NOT ONLY THAT, BUT EACH OF THE JEWELS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; REFLECTED IN THIS ONE JEWEL IS ALSO REFLECTING ALL THE OTHER JEWELS, SO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THAT THE PROCESS OF REFLECTION IS INFINITE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This metaphysic does validate what otherwise be a non-sequitur; we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot know anything because we cannot know everything. Any finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; belief-system must be fall short of ultimate truth because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finite. But without the holistic metaphysics of the Net Of Indra, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inference is simply a mistake. This is another mystical belief that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requires a metaphysical posit, not simply a consideration of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limitations of knowledge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Science uses a methodology or reductionism, of divide and conquer, of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; breaking things down into their simplest components. A universe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plays ball with this is a mechanical, rather than organic universe. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our purposes, the most pertinent aspect of mechanism is the fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it involves linear chains of causation. A causes B , and B causes C. C
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not directly related to A and does not carry traces of A within it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is an advantage, because it reduces the number of things one has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to understand in order to understand C. (In the Organic universe, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is of course everyhting). It is also the source of pretty well every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variety of scepticism, since A could have been replaced by A' without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing C. If C is some effect worked on my sense-organs by an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; external cause, then C could be the same in a scenario where it was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; caused by A' rather than A. I could be a brain in a vat, I could be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dupe of a Descartes Evil Spirit, I could be in a computer simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All these scenarios are variations on the theme of my percepts, my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense-data, being causes mechanically by something other that I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is causing them. In the organic universe, they are impossible because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already contain the whole world within myself, so substitions are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impossible without changing everything else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Both Mechanism and Organism, then, lead to paradoxes. Mechanism makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world simple enough to understand (structurally, from a 3rd-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perspective) at the expense of making its &quot;in itself&quot; nature uncertain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Organism means that every being contains the nature of the whol eof
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality within itself -- but at the expense of making the Whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incomprehensible to linear, 3rd-person, structural knowing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is Reality real ? the Simulation Argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Simulation Argument seeks to show that it is not just possible that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are living inside a simulation, but likely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 You cannot simulate a world of X complexity inside a world of X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity.(quart-into-a-pint-pot-problem).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2 Therefore, if we are in a simulation the 'real' world outside the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation is much more complex and quite possibly completely different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the simulated world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3 In which case, we cannot make sound inferences from the world we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appear to be in to alleged real world in which the simulation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; running
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4 Therefore we cannot appeal to an argumentative apparatus of advanced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; races, simulations etc, since all those concepts are derived from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world as we see it -- which, by hypothesis is a mere simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5 Therefore, the simulation argument pulls the metaphysical rug from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; under its epistemological feet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The counterargument does not show that we are not living in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulation, but if we are , we have no way of knowing whether it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely or not. Even if it seems likely that we will go on to create
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (sub) simulations, that does not mean we are living in a simulation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is likely for the same reasons, since our simulation might be rare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and peculiar. In particular, it might have the peculiarity that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sub-simulations are easy to create in it. For all we know our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulators had extreme difficulty in creating our universe. In this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case, the fact that it is easy to create sub simulations within our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (supposed) simulation, does not mean it is easy to creae simulations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; per se.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    5. The Case Against Mathematial Monism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why Mathematics Works
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    1. Mathematics is the theoretical exploration of every possible kind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of abstract structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    2. The world has some kind of structure; it is not chaos or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; featureless or void
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    3. Therefore, it is likely that at least some of the structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discovered by mathematicians are applicable to the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (It would be strange if everything mathematicans came up with was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirically applicable, and might tend one towards Platonism or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rationalism, but this is not the case. It might be possible for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematicians working completely abstractly and theoretically to fail
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to include any empirically useful structures in the finite list of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures so far achieved, but maths is not divorced from empiricism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and practicallity to that extent -- what I say in (1) is something of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an idealisation).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gods and Monsters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the meditations of Marcus Aurelius, a distinction is drawn between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two basic attitudes to philosophy, the Gods and the Monsters. Monsters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are down-to-earth and commonsensical, Gods are high-minded and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abstract. &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	gods	Monsters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Epistemology	Rationalism 	Empiricism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Metaphysics	Idealism 	Materialism

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Mathematical Monistic Many-World Model Introduced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    1. Single (physical) universe theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    2. Physical Multiverse theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    3. Mathematical Multiverse Theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonism is the idea that mathematical objects have an independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence of their own, in addition to the physical world. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical Monistic Many-World Model idea keeps the Platonic realm of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers, but drops the physical world, claiming we are somehow &quot;inside&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world of numbers. One alleged benefit of this view is that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; removes the contingency, the &quot;just so&quot; quality of a universe consiting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of specific physical laws. Another is the claim that the success of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics shows everything is mathematical, or at least has a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical description. Another is the claim that matter adds nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanatorily to maths.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For and Against Mathematical Platonism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The case for Mathematical Platonism needs to be made in the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place; if numbers do not exist at all, the universe, as an existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing, cannot be a mathematical structure. (solipsists read: if numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not real, I cannot be mathematical structure).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The claim that nothing exists but numbers is not just the claim that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the world is the kind of mathematical structure described by physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because that is only one of a multitude of mathematically possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures. The nothing-but-numbers claim entails the claim that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multitude of mathematically consistent worlds exist which do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correspond to anything that is observed. To put it another way, physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is based on picking the mathematical structure that corresponds to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observation, so that only a subsection of physics is mathematically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; useful. Thus the success of physics as a mathematical science does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prove the nothing-but-numbers claim.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theories of Everything (TOEs) seek to avoid explain away the apparent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (contingency) of the world. They are exercises in armchair rationalism,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and as such contingent facts that can only be derived from observation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot be permitted. Having said that, the armchair rationalist is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allowed to appeal to some very broad facts, such as his own existence,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the *appearance* of contingency -- the fact that he sees some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things in the world around him, and others just are not there. Without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his own existence, the simplest non-contingent theory of reality is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that nothing exists! Apparent contingency, the finiteness, of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experienced world is a trickier issue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Case Against Mathematical Platonism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The epistemic case for mathematical Platonism is be argued on the basis
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the objective nature of mathematical truth. Superficially, it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; persuasive that objectivity requires objects. However, the basic case
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the objectivity of mathematics is the tendency of mathematicians to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree about the answers to mathematical problems; this can be explained
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by noting that mathematical logic is based on axioms and rules of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inference, and different mathematicians following the same rules will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tend to get the same answers , like different computers running the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The semantic case for mathematical Platonism is based on the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the terms in a mathematical sentence must mean something, and therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; must refer to objects. It can be argued on general linguistic grounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that not all meaning is reference to some kind of object outside the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; head. Some meaning is sense, some is reference. That establishes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility that mathematical terms do not have references. What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; establishes it is as likely and not merely possible is the obeservation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that nothing like empirical investigation is needed to establish the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth of mathematical statements. Mathematical truth is arrived at by a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; purely conceptual process, which is what would be expected if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical meaning were restricted to the Sense, the &quot;in the head&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; component of meaning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The logical case for mathematical Platonism is based on the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical statements are true, and make existence claims. That they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are true is not disputed by the anti-Platonist, who must therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; claim that mathematical existence claims are somehow weaker than other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence claims -- perhaps merely metaphorical. That the the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;exists&quot; means different things in different contexts is easily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; established.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For one thing, this is already conceded by Platonists! Platonists think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonic existence is eternal, immaterial non-spatial, and so on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unlike the Earthly existence of material bodies. For another, we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already used to contextualising the meaning of &quot;exists&quot;. We agree with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both: &quot;helicopters exist&quot;; and &quot;helicopters don't exist in Middle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earth&quot;. (People who base their entire anti-Platonic philosophy are on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this idea are called fictionalists. However, mathematics is not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fiction because it is not a free creation. Mathematicians are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constrained by consistency and non-contradiction in a way that authors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not. Dr Watson's fictional existence is intact despite the fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that he is sometimes called John and sometimes James in Conan Doyle's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stories).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A possible counter argument by the Platonist is that the downgrading of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical existence to a mere metaphor is arbitrary. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anti-Platonist must show that a consistent standard is being applied.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This it is possible to do; the standard is to take the meaning of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence in the context of a particular proposition to relate to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means of justification of the proposition. Since ordinary statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are confirmed empirically, &quot;exists&quot; means &quot;can be perceived&quot; in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context. Since sufficient grounds for asserting the existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical objects are that it is does not contradict anything else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in mathematics, mathematical existence just amounts to concpetual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-contradictoriness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Incidentally, this approach answers a question about mathematical and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; empirical truth. The anti-Platonists wants the two kinds of truth to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different, but also needs them to be related so as to avoid the charge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one class of statement is not true at all. This can be achieved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because empirical statements rest on non-contradiction in order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achive correspondence. If an empricial observation fails co correspond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a statemet, there is a contradiction between them. Thus
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-contradiciton is a necessary but insufficient justification for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; truth in empircal statements, but a sufficient one for mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; statements).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The forgoing establishes that Platonism is dispensible. What
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; establishes that anti-Platonism is actually preferable? One point in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its favour is that it is simpler.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All the facts about mathematical truth and methodology can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; established without appeal to the actual existence of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects. In fact, the lack of such objects actually explains the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objectivity and necessity of maths. Mathematical statements are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily true because there are no possible circumstances that make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them false; there are no possible circumstances that would make them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; false because they do not refer to anything external. This is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simpler than the Platonist alternative that mathematical statements:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) have referents
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2) unchanging and eternal, unlike anything anyone has actually seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and thereby
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3) explain the necessity (invariance) of mathematical statements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4) performing any other role -- they are not involved inbr /&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical proof.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For and Against Matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Matter is a bare substrate with no properties of its own. The question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may well be asked at this point: what roles does it perform ? Why not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dispense with matter and just have bundles of properties -- what does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter add to a merely abstract set of properties? The answer is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not all bundles of posible properties are instantiated, that they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What does it mean to say something exists ? &quot;..exists&quot; is a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicate of concepts rather than things. The thing must exist in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense to be talked about. But if it existed full, a statement like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Nessie doesn't exist&quot; would be a contradiction ...it would amount to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;the existing thing Nessie doesnt exist&quot;. However, if we take that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;some sense&quot; in which the subject of an &quot;...exists&quot; predicate exists is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only initially as a concept, we can then say whether or not the concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has something to refer to. Thus &quot;Bigfoot exists&quot; would mean &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept 'Bigfoot' has a referent&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What matter adds to a bundle of properties is existence. A non-existent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bundle of properties is a mere concept, a mere possibility. Thus the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of matter is very much tied to the idea of contingency or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;somethingism&quot; -- the idea that only certain possible things exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other issue matter is able to explain as a result of having no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties of its own is the issue of change and time. For change to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguishable from mere succession, it must be change in something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It could be a contingent natural law that certain properties never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change. However, with a propertiless substrate, it becomes a logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessity that the substrate endures through change; since all changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are changes in properties, a propertiless substrate cannot itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change and must endure through change. In more detail here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Case Against Mathematial Monism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical monism is both too broad and too narrow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Too broad: If I am just a mathematical structure, I should have a much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wider range of experience than I do. There is a mathemtical structure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corresponding to myself with all my experiences up to time T. There is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a vast array of mathematical structures corresponding to other versions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of me with having a huge range of experiences -- ordinary ones, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuing to type, extraordinary ones like seeing my computer sudenly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; turn into bowl of petunias. All these versions of me share the memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the &quot;me&quot; who is writing this, so they all identify themselves as me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember, that for mathematical monism it is only necessary that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible experience has a mathematical description. This is known as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the White Rabbit problem. If we think in terms of multiverse theories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we would say that there is one &quot;me&quot; in this universe and other &quot;me's&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in other universes,a nd they are kept out of contact with each other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The question is whether a purely mathematical scheme has enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resources to impose isolation or otherwise remove the White Rabbit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Too narrow: there are a number of prima-facie phenomena which a purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical approach struggles to deal with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * space
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * causality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * necessity/contingency
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why space ? It is tempting to think that if a number of, or some other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical entity, occurs in a set with other numbers, that is, as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were, a &quot;space&quot; which is disconnected from other sets, so that a set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms a natural model of an *isolated* universe withing a multiverse, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe which does not suffer from the White Rabbit problem. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maths per se does not work that way. The number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of even numbers is exactly the same number &quot;2&quot; that appears in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list of numbers less than 10. It does not acquire any further
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characteristics from its context.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The time issue should be obvious. Mathematics is tradionally held to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deal with timeless, eternal truths. This is reflected in the metpahor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of mathematical truth being discovered not found (which, in line with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my criticism of Platonism, should not be taken to seriously). It could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be objected that physics can model time mathematically; it can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objected right back that it does so by spatialising time, by turning it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into just another dimension, in which nothing really changes, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing passes. Some even go so far as to insist that this model is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what time &quot;really&quot; is, which is surely a case of mistaking the map for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the territory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Consciousness is a problem for all forms of materialism and physicalism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to some extent, but it is possible to discern where the problem is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particularly acute. There is no great problem with the idea that matter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered as a bare substrate can have mental properities. Any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inability to have mental properties would itself be a property and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore be inconsistent with the bareness of a bare substrate. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;subjectivity&quot; of conscious states, often treated as &quot;inherent&quot; boils
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down to a problem of communicating one's qualia -- how one feels, how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things seem. Thus it is not truly inherent but depends on the means of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communication being used. Feelings and seemings can be more readily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicated in artistic, poetic language, and least readily in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientific, technical language. Since the harder, more technical a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science is, the more mathematical it is, the communication problem is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at its most acute in a purely mathematical langauge. Thus the problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare substrate) but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; its other posit, that all properties are physical. Since physics is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical, that amounts to the claim that all properties are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical (or at least mathematically describable). In making the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transition from a physicalist world-view to a mathematical one, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was never a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem for consciousness) and mathematical properties become the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible basis for qualia. Qualia have to be reducible to, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identifiable with, mathematical properties, if they exist at all. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means that the problem for consciousness becomes extreme, since there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no longer the possibility of qualia existing in their own right, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; properties of a material substrate, without supervening on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematically describable properties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The interesting thing is that these two problems can be used to solve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each other to some extent. if we allow extra-mathemtical properties
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into our universe, we can use them to solve the White Rabbit problem.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are two ways of doing this: We can claim either:-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * White Rabbit universes don't exist at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     * White Rabbit universes are causally separated from us (or remote
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in space)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first is basically a reversion to a single-universe theory (1).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical monists sometimes complain that they can't see what role
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matter plays. One way of seeing its role is as a solution to the WR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem. For the non-Platonist, most mathematical entitites have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;merely abstract&quot; existence. Only a subset truly, conceretely, exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is an extra factor that the priveleged few have. What is it ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Materiality. For the physicalist, matter is the token of existence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maerial things, exist, immaterial ones don't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second moves on from a Mathematical Multiverse to a physical one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3). The interesting thing about the second variety of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-just-mathematical monism is that as well as addressing the White
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rabbit problem, it removes some further contingency. If the matter,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physical laws, and so on, are logically possible, then the general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach of arguing for a universe/multiverse on the grounds of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; removing contingency must embrace them -- otherwise it would be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent fact that the universe/multiverse consists of nothing but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics.
