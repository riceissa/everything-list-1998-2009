I just send a posting to the FOR list about my article. I did not have the
<br />
time to reply to everyone on this list previously. Reading the old
<br />
discussion again, I think that it was suggested that the exact quantum
<br />
states matter, but they don't. It was only used to illustrate the thought
<br />
experiment by Deutsch which would allow one to prove that the MWI is
<br />
correct.
<br />
<br />This is what I sent to the FOR list:
<br />
<br /><br />Some time ago I wrote a small article:
<br />
<br /><br /><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3825">http://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3825</a>
<br />
<br /><br />This was recently featured in New Scientist:
<br />
<br /><br /><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227044.200-avoid-a-future-cataclysm-forget-the-past.html">http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227044.200-avoid-a-future-cataclysm-forget-the-past.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br />The idea is that an observer can undo things that have already happened by
<br />
resetting its memory, because when you reset your memory to a previous
<br />
state, that previous state you are evolving into will be the same in a
<br />
sector of the multiverse which evolved from that previous state and then was
<br />
reset for any reason. So, if the reseting is triggered for reason A or
<br />
reason B, it would lead to the observer ending up in the same state. The
<br />
outcome of a new measuremnt to find out why the mempory was reset is then
<br />
not pre-determined.
<br />
<br />Some details:
<br />
<br />The word &quot;state&quot; here refers to the classically describable state of an
<br />
observer. In the article, I focus on machine observers. The subjective state
<br />
of the observer is then exactly specified by specifying the ones and zeroes
<br />
of the bits of the memory. So, I assume that whatever the observer can be
<br />
aware of is encoded by the classical state of the bits of the computer and
<br />
not the exact quantum state of the computer. The exact state of the computer
<br />
has to be specified using a wavefunction of the computer (in fact, the state
<br />
of the computer will be entangled with the rest of the universe).
<br />
<br /><br />Then, one can write down any generic quantum state of the universe
<br />
containing the observer by supplementing the (classical) information stored
<br />
in the bits by the extra information you need to fully specify the
<br />
wavefunction of the computer and everything else in the universe. One can
<br />
then consider the unitary transformations that would represent a memory
<br />
backup, memory resetting etc.
<br />
<br /><br />After the memory resetting, you are notified why the memory was reset. Since
<br />
the relevant things happen in the realm where classical physics applies, the
<br />
probabilities are the same as what you would find using purely classical
<br />
reasoning. The interpretation of these probablilites is, however, different
<br />
from classical physics. When the memory is reset, you evolve to some state
<br />
while the rest of the inverse will be in some superposition of states in
<br />
which the memory was reset for various reasons. Then, before finding out why
<br />
the memory was reset, the outcome of that observation is not pre-determined
<br />
