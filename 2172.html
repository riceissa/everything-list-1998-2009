when the computer is simulating his universe, or does his universe

means that we can take look at his universe and even interact with him?
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the latter is true then clearly all possible universes exist
</em><br />
independently of each other. We can then ask why we find ourselves in
<br />
this0 &gt;universe instead of the rather boring universe of the prisoner. I
<br />
think that this must follow from probabilistic arguments. It may be that
<br />
all &gt;universes are, in some sense, equally likely a priory. The
<br />
probability that we find ourselves in a particular universe would then
<br />
be given by an &gt;appropriate conditional probability. When we refer to
<br />
our universe we actually refer to a large class of universes, because we
<br />
don't have &gt;complete knowledge of our universe (we can only store a
<br />
finite amount of information in our brains). So, given the knowledge we
<br />
do have, we &gt;live in a large number of universes ``simultaneously创, and
<br />
the number of ``equivalent创 universes increases with its size. We
<br />
should thus ask &gt;for the probability that we live in any of the
<br />
equivalent universes. It is thus clear that ``our创 universe is
<br />
infinitely more likely than the &gt;prisoner`s universe.
<br />
<br />As Russell has posted, the prisoner's universe is &quot;over-specified&quot; and
<br />
so is actually more complex than our universe. However, if it is true
<br />
that a Turing machine such as the Game of Life can realize a
<br />
self-conscious being, then one wonders whether such a simply constructed
<br />
universe would have less information and be more probable.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Interestingly this fits in well with observational evidence that our
</em><br />
universe is flat. From the arguments I gave above, you would expect that
<br />
the &gt;universe is spatially open, because such an universe has an
<br />
infinite volume. This infinite volume also cause me to exist in an
<br />
infinite number of &gt;places simultaneously in a single universe, because
<br />
the probability that somewhere an intelligent being emerges that has
<br />
stored in his brain the &gt;same information as in my brain is extremely
<br />
small but strictly larger than zero due to the finiteness of the amount
<br />
of information that can be &gt;stored in the brain. It would, of course,
<br />
necessarily be the case that this intelligent being is very, very
<br />
similar to me and that he lives on a planet &gt;which is very similar to
<br />
the earth. Now it would be reasonable to expect that an universe where
<br />
the density of ``copies创 of me is larger is more &gt;probable. By
<br />
increasing the matter density of the universe I can increase the number
<br />
of copies of myself, but if the matter density becomes too &gt;large then
<br />
the universe would be spatially closed. Therefore it is reasonable to
<br />
expect that we live in a flat universe.
<br />
<br />A flat universe (omega=1) is most consistent with cosmic inflation,
<br />
which is the simplest theory that would explain large-scale homogeneity
<br />
in the universe. Other theories allow open inflation, but are more
<br />
complicated in certain ways. Simpler theories go hand-in-hand with
<br />
greater measure. It is often tempting to appeal to anthropic reasoning
<br />
to justify the matter density we observe, but we have to beware of a
<br />
theory of everything may come along which will make all the numbers
<br />
which allow us to exist obvious.
