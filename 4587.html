I think your idea makes sense.
<br />
Just like the distance between two particles is not 'nothing' but a real
<br />
property of the universe at that time (therefore there are 3 things in
<br />
mary's brain), also the specific configuration of neurotransmitters and
<br />
electrical impulses in the brain is something not less real than the
<br />
individual constituent parts of the brain itself. So it could very well be
<br />
that we are this something (this configuration). Maybe there is something it
<br />
feels like for the distance between two particles to increase.
<br />
<br />Another possibility is that subjective sensations and qualia are the only
<br />
things that exist, the very structure of the universe, and the existence of
<br />
the physical, and even the way it seems to all make sense, these maybe only
<br />
details of the experiences that we happen to have.
<br />
I imagine an infinite dimensional space in which every possible quale has
<br />
one dimension, with intensity ranging from 0 to infinity. Within such a
<br />
framework, every stream of consciousness could be defined as a
<br />
multidimensional curve. At Point A you have pain in your neck of intensity
<br />
X, see a red blob with intensity Y and so forth. Then your point at that
<br />
time would be (x,y) in a 2dimensional space (for simplicity). This solves
<br />
copy paradoxes and teleportation arguments, if it's not clear how it does so
<br />
feel free to mail me.
<br />
<br />I have an additional thought about qualia that I haven't found in the
<br />
literature.
<br />
For us to talk about qualia the brain needs to represent them. If the brain
<br />
represents them, then they are not qualia anymore. When we say the redness
<br />
of red, the brain is representing this, so in the end it IS all a matter of
<br />
data structures and representation. This in my opinion invalidates all
<br />
dualistic theories, since it eliminates the need for any kind of soul and
<br />
for a connection between soul and hardware. Any thoughts on this?

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dear Folks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once again I find myself fossicking at the boundaries and need to ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of those questions. My first experience with an asker of such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question was in  the last couple of years at high school. I'll tell
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you about it because, well, the list could use a little activity and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hope the 'fabric' list doesn't mind the rather voluminous joining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; post. The story:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Person X raises his hand in class and the question is asked. The most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insanely stupid question. At least that's what it appeared to be to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most of the class. Snicker. Guffaw. Snicker. Rhubarb. Rhubarb. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mexican wave of derision filters through the pubescent ranks. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wave didn't get past me. I looked at person X across the room. Yes, on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the face of it that question was the pathetic pleading of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparently brain dead. Yet I knew it could not be. For person X was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one of those kids that got scarily high marks.  I knew that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question had answered something far deeper for person X than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shallow meanderings of the distinterested that formed the rest of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; class sitting in judgement. And none of them would ever realise that.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's the stupid question story. Now for the apparently stupid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; question, which I'll pose in 2 parts. The first part is a little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; background. For those of you who subscribe to the PSYCHE lists, you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will have seen my recent question &quot;Exploded Brain Mary&quot; on PSYCHE-D.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This question is in pursuit of understanding of a topic not apparent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the question and I'm afraid I can't go into detail. It's about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolving the bottom layer of a speculative model for qualia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now this model is around 11 layers deep. It's a very detailed model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I'm going to do my best to bring it into the public eye for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scrutiny in due course. Somehow. Suggestions anyone? There is no way I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can possibly bring you all up to speed on the whole thing but I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say that I have hit a final wall of mystery which appears to suggest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something that may be true about consciousness that may be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'fundamental' bedrock. Something that is breathtakingly simple yet so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; odd I am here to ask you folks to see what I see. To see where it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads. I really don't know if it's well trodden ground or not.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second part is 2C Mary. This is a small thought experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; designed to illustrate as simply as I can the possibility for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism for access to apparently physics-violating phenomena. Those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interested in philosophy of mind will recognise that poor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neuroscientist Mary has been the subject of many a thought experiment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and she has acquiesced to appalling things in the name of science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This one is no different!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let's get rid of Mary's brain completely. A radical brainectomy. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are going to replace it with two particles. Each particle is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; travelling at the speed of light, C, but in perfectly opposing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directions. The distance between them is growing at a speed of 2C. Now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing is actually moving at 2C and all is well for physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The real question is the ontological status of the 'nothing' in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last sentence. I am starting to believe that the true nature of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'fundamental' beneath qualia is not only about the 'stuff', but is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually about all of it. That is, the 'stuff' and the 'not stuff'. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you think of Mary, she actually has 3 things in her brain. She has 2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles doing something and one extra thing defined by their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour. The behaviour of a mathematical line between the two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; centres of mass of the particles. What argument removes that third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'thing' from Mary as an (cognitive) entity occupying our universe? I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find I can no longer dismiss this third thing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now the relationship - the causal chain - between what I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; described and the qualia model is not easy to deduce. You'll have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accept for the moment that there is one. The reason I need to explore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this is that I have identified what I think is a form of apparent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-locality accessible by simply 'being' part of the universe, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's like the same form of access to physics violation that 2C Mary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gets.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do I need this? Without going into detail, it possibly supplies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the answer to 'Exploded Brain Mary' that seems intuitively right yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so bizarre, to me, anyway. It's the basis for solving the so-called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'unity of consciousness' issue, which, if this goes anywhere at all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will simply evaporate as a non-problem and no actual unity at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The nature of the thought process that has been plaguing me for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last few weeks has slowly found its way to a question of the form I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have just outlined. I suppose what I am asking is -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Has anyone else been down this road? Is it a road at all?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So many times I find I am walking in footsteps and only lack the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptor to find prior art.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In closure, I'd like to support the general way of thinking about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this. A cloud is as much defined by what it is as what it is not. All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reality' as we describe it, has two halves. We have been so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preoccupied with what 'is', we (presumptuous here, sorry. Set me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; straight, please) have completely missed it's opposite. Turn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everything inside out. Imagine that the only 'reality' is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes involved by the universe in actively constructing what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _don't_ consider matter. Keep in mind that if we 'be' any portion of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universe we have to be all of it -  Everything contributed by what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is and every 'thing' incidentally created by being that very stuff,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'things' that are 'not' that stuff. These are ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent, I think. We don't even have the language for this. P+ for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'phenomena stuff' and P- for not-stuff? The qualia model calls it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'inverse phenomenology'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Posing the question at all has been useful. I don't know if anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else out there can do anything but start considering what it may mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (other than perhaps colin should be on medication!). This is all I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ask - have a think. If anyone wants to put the idea to death in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cogent fashion I'd appreciate it! It'll save me a lot of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Resolution is my goal. Either way is OK with me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The nice thing about this, after roughly 10 layers of classical,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already-described-physics is that this is the only thing left. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes qualia beautiful. An 'elemental quale' appear to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; destructive and energetic collision between P+ and P-, as I described.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Beautiful but rather mundane, if the model holds up OK. All the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model's layers point an arrow at this one thing I have described. I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the end and I find... Nothing or rather, &quot;NOT thing&quot;. It is why I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am here, asking my stupid question.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So. Anyone care to comment on the ontological status of 'not thing'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regardless, it's been fun writing this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
