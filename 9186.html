Hi,
<br />
<br />I think I have already mentionned it (four years ago?) but I have 
<br />
another Theory of Everything sleeping somewhere in my brain and books. 
<br />
I made an allusion about it yesterday in my post to Peter D Jones, and 
<br />
I take this as an opportunity to say some more words on it. Hope it is 
<br />
not too technical.
<br />
That theory is hardly original because it simply corresponds to the 
<br />
Polya-Hilbert conjecture in number theory. To sum it up, Euler 
<br />
discovered a rather cute relationship between the infinite sum of the 
<br />
inverse of natural numbers, with some exponents, and some infinite 
<br />
products related to the prime numbers. Precisely:
<br />
<br />Sum (n = 1 to infinity) 1/n^s = Product (on all primes) 1/(1-1/p^s). 
<br />
This is the well known zeta Riemann function.

<br /><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />
<br /><br />Or look at <a href="http://primes.utm.edu/notes/rh.html">http://primes.utm.edu/notes/rh.html</a>
<br />
or here: <a href="http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/tutorial.htm">http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/tutorial.htm</a>
<br />
<br />The equivalence of that sum and product is actually equivalent with the 
<br />
fundamental theorem of arithmetic (which says that all numbers admit a 
<br />
unique decomposition in a product of primes numbers (not taking into 
<br />
account the factor order). Thanks to the work of Cauchy (complex 
<br />
analysis) Riemann realized that his zeta function zeta(s) defined a 
<br />
unique analytical function from C to C (C = the complex numbers), that 
<br />
is taking s as a variable on the C complex plane.
<br />
Zeta(1), which is the harmonic series, still diverge but all other 
<br />
value of s, crazily enough, makes zeta converging. In particular 
<br />
zeta(-1) = -1/12. And this is a little bit crazy because it means that 
<br />
on the complex plane there is a sense to say that the infinite serie 1 
<br />
+ 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + ...  converge to minus 1/12. (When Ramanujan applied 
<br />
for a mathematician job in England, he just annonce that formula to 
<br />
show that he has some ability in computation stuff, and then he has 
<br />
been lucky enough that Hardy did understood it at once, knowing Riemann 
<br />
work).
<br />
Now some computation can show that the behavior of the prime numbers, I 
<br />
mean the way they are distributed among natural numbers, is controlled 
<br />
by a set of zero of the Riemann zeta function.
<br />
Actually that control is very fine once we assume those critical zero 
<br />
are all arranged on a line, and this is the famous Riemann hypothesis 
<br />
which fascinates so much mathematicians. The best introduction to that 
<br />
field (for those who remembers their high school math) is the dover 
<br />
book:
<br />
H. M. Edwards, Riemann's Zeta Function, Dover Publications, 2001. It 
<br />
contains the original paper by Riemann.
<br />
<br />Now, all those zero could be justified being on a line in the case 
<br />
those zero would describe a spectrum of some quantum observable, and so 
<br />
this suggests a way to tackle that conjecture, and that way is 
<br />
attributed to Polya and Hilbert---from oral talks, see:
<br />
<a href="http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/polya/index.html">http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/polya/index.html</a>
<br />
<br />Now a logician can show that if you take the arithmetical formula 
<br />
having only the addition symbol (together with  all other logical 
<br />
symbols except the multiplication) or, contrarily, only the 
<br />
multiplication symbol (and the logical one but no addition) well, in 
<br />
each case you can find a corresponding decidable and complete theory 
<br />
(with respect to truth for those set of formula).
<br />
Put in another way, it is the mixing of addition and multiplication 
<br />
which is at the original of the richness of the relation between 
<br />
numbers. I have always suspected that the distribution of the prime 
<br />
numbers could encoded the logical mess coming from that mixing. In that 
<br />
case some &quot;total&quot; knowledge of the distribution of the primes would 
<br />
encode a necessarily non trivial part of the (incomplete, 
<br />
unaxiomatizable) arithmetical knowledge.
<br />
<br />The fact is that, thanks to an algorithm due mainly to Turing and 
<br />
refined by Odlyzko, there is a sort of experimental verification of the 
<br />
Polya-Hilbert conjecture. Indeed it looks like if the zeros of the zeta 
<br />
function describe a spectrum already introduced by quantum physicists 
<br />
when they have been confronted to very complex quantum system like big 
<br />
atom's nucleus: actually they introduce for such system just very big 
<br />
random matrices up  the necessary condition of being unitary. It can be 
<br />
shown that such operator (interpreted in some way) describes a form of 
<br />
&quot;quantum chaos&quot;. Such an &quot;experimental&quot; verification is of course very 
<br />
frustrating from the point of view of a mathematician who want to 
<br />
*prove* the Riemann hypothesis, but then it is a sort of delight for a 
<br />
pythagorean philosopher who want to extract physics from number theory. 
<br />
Actually, assuming comp and the 1-3 distinction,  it would be enough to 
<br />
show that this &quot;quantum chaos&quot; (or some semi-classical regime which can 
<br />
be associated with it) is rich enough to simulate (even in a weak local 
<br />
sense) a universal dovetailer, for getting freely a universal quantum 
<br />
dovetailer from the prime numbers.
<br />
I believe that an extraction of a universal dovetailer from the primes 
<br />
would also make the Riemann hypothesis undecidable in a very weak 
<br />
arithmetical theory (like Peano Arithmetic, or the weaker Robinson 
<br />
one), and that would be enough to prove the Riemann hypothesis (giving 
<br />
that if the Riemann Hypo is false then it is refutable in Peano 
<br />
Arithmetic (because PA can provably simulate the Turing-Odlyzko 
<br />
algorithm which search for zero out of the critical line).
<br />
<br />Such a theory is obviously compatible with what we could find by the 
<br />
&quot;pure&quot; interview of the lobian machine, and if it is true, should be 
<br />
identical.
<br />
<br />Such a Pythagorean TOE would give a more direct explanation of physics 
<br />
from numbers, as compared to the lobian interview which needs that 
<br />
godel encoding of propositions and machines, in term of numbers (many 
<br />
mathematicians hates such (intensional) use of numbers), but then such 
<br />
a theory would hide the 1-3 distinction in some &quot;Everett like 
<br />
interpretation of prime number generated quantum chaos).
<br />
<br />Unfortunately I don't know well about quantum chaos. If someone knows 
<br />
about a proof of non-universality of quantum chaos .... Actually I got 
<br />
a proof of turing universality of classical chaos, and I got evidence 
<br />
of many universal facets of the zeta riemann conjecture, thanks to a 
<br />
work by Voronin:
<br />
<a href="http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/voronin.htm">http://www.maths.ex.ac.uk/~mwatkins/zeta/voronin.htm</a>
<br />
The rest are conjectures; even more difficult than the lobian one ...
<br />
<br />Still I hope this post can help you to understand in a different way 
<br />
than my usual UDA/Lobian one, (or Hal Finney's universal absolute 
<br />
distribution, and other OM based toes) how realities could emerge from 
<br />
number theoretical relations. The advantage is that if it works, it 
<br />
would provide directly a universal *quantum* dovetailer. The lobian one 
<br />
leads only indirectly to it (if it leads to it at all).
<br />
<br />Bruno
