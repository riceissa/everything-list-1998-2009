Hi Max,
<br />
In line with my preoccupation and passion: consciousness......... I
<br />
confine my comments to that narrow scope and offer the following
<br />
observations (which I did with my phenomenal consciousness! :-)
<br />
<br />Page 4 Section D.
<br />
I cannot utter a 'WOOHOO!' too loud here, to finally see these kinds
<br />
of words appearing. There is a long record on this forum of me trying
<br />
to get people to _really_  grasp the nature of  the difference between
<br />
&quot;Description/Appearance(apparent causal necessity)/Phenomenon&quot; to
<br />
&quot;Explanation/Actual Causal Necessity/Noumenon&quot;. In Max's work we
<br />
clearly have the arrival of a scientifically valid noumenon.
<br />
<br />You may be aware that I have been raving on ad nauseum here recently
<br />
about my &quot;EC&quot;, which literally is a 'MUH'. The universe literally 'is'
<br />
an instantated EC, say MUHcol. We humans are literally an ongoing
<br />
proof written in EC.....albeit of a different nature to the one
<br />
proposed, say MUHmax. The difference between MUHmax and MUHcol are not
<br />
important - the fact of the clear appreciation and expression of the
<br />
ontological/epistemological 'cut' (as Howard Pattee[2] puts it) and
<br />
distinction is what is important. ..........the words clearly
<br />
distinguish 'being' from 'appearance'. They embed the origins of all
<br />
knowledge as sourced subjectively from within it....through the
<br />
embedded agency of the FROG scientist's depiction of the BIRD side of
<br />
the cut.
<br />
<br />More than that, the words emerge in a way that is hard to argue
<br />
against without appearing (at least methodologically/virtually) to
<br />
hold rather bizarre views about the ontology (underlying reality) of
<br />
the universe - ...far more bizarre than any MUH.........as the final
<br />
para clearly shows. so ............YES!
<br />
<br />RE: Frogs and Birds
<br />
Having said the above, I detect a possible small crack in the Bird/
<br />
Frog depiction that might open up a door for  unfounded criticism
<br />
from those who struggle to see the difference between a noumenon and
<br />
phenomenon. What you are describing is what I have written about
<br />
(rather badly!) [1]: It is a 'dual aspect science'. What I described
<br />
there is the phenomenon aspect (T = FROG) and the 'noumenon' aspect
<br />
(T' = BIRD). Both are completely equivalent descriptions of the same
<br />
thing, the universe U(.) as T' and how that universe appears (T') when
<br />
you are made of it, inside it, with observational capacities delivered
<br />
by T', _not_ T. The 'helicopter/bird' view metaphor is not quite
<br />
right, IMO - the MUH is a noumenon and not to be confused with an
<br />
'objective view' (there is no such thing!)...the BIRD metaphor might
<br />
confuse things.
<br />
<br />The missing subtlety, which undermines all empirical support for
<br />
MUHmax, is that both the  FROG's view _AND_ the BIRD's view are
<br />
equally supported by any and all empirical work. (with specific ref to
<br />
the isomorphism sentence on P4, section D). The FROG can lay no claim
<br />
to exclusive use of empirical work - for the noumenon is the thing
<br />
that is actually generating the 'observation' intrinsic in ...as you
<br />
say on P4, top.....'processes that give rise to the familiar
<br />
sensations of self awareness' ......that the FROG has... that are the
<br />
single, mandated and only sources of all scientific evidence (where
<br />
scientist = FROG, and everything about the MUH is a product of that
<br />
perspective). Without that faculty there is no science.
<br />
<br />I hope I am making sense here....I don't think you have made enough
<br />
mileage out of this brute FROG/BIRD reality as regards their place as
<br />
equals in provision of DESCRIPTION/EXPLANATION resp. using the same
<br />
evidence system: phenomenal consciousness.
<br />
<br />RE: Final Note
<br />
There is one aspect to MUH which remains completely absent and which,
<br />
IMO, is absolutely vital to any real 'TOE'..... Whilst recognizing
<br />
that 'it is like something' to be FROG.....MUHmax provides no basis
<br />
for the necessity that it be 'like something' to be FROG under the
<br />
circumstances of being configured as a FROG. That 'contents of
<br />
consciousness/that which is seen/observed', is the single source of
<br />
all scientific evidence used in support of all FROG and BIRD MUH rule
<br />
sets (=FROG/BIRD aspect science)....Fine...But nowhere is the paper
<br />
MUHmax explanatory of how the BIRD view/descriptions provide the
<br />
phenomenal consciousness that the FROG uses to do observation in
<br />
support of all propositions for either collection of rules. After
<br />
all.....it is not the FROGs descriptions, derived _directly using_
<br />
observation of MUH that deliver the observations.........this is
<br />
oxymoronic.....rather it is the noumenon (The BIRD rules of MUHmax)
<br />
that delivers observation (the faculty of observation, through which
<br />
all FROG views are delivered).
<br />
<br />A TOE must deliver 'everything', right? Well this chunk of
<br />
'everything' is not in the paper. None of the QM or anything else in
<br />
your paper does it, nor does it propose a principle upon which it may
<br />
be delivered....AFAICT. Maybe I missed it or have wires
<br />
crossed....Having said that, I don't believe you actually have to
<br />
deliver it right now............what is more important is mere
<br />
recognition of the need  and a clear delineation of the responsibility
<br />
for the ultimate source of the FROG's ability to observe as BIRD-
<br />
aspect rules, not FROG-aspect rules.
<br />
<br />To me the detail of the MUHmax is a side issue to the real message of
<br />
your paper......regardless of the chosen MUH (there could be 100
<br />
flavours including a MUHbruno and so on....), what has to happen to
<br />
science is that it must go 'dual aspect' and recognise KANT's error
<br />
that  the noumenon is scientifically intractable........and that is,
<br />
in effect, what you have done...IMHO...of course....
<br />
<br />I hope this is of some use..........
<br />
<br />cheers
