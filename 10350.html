</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, and I despair (almost) of remedying this, even if I knew how. My
</em><br />
own attempts at linguistic 'clarity' seemed destined only to muddy the
<br />
waters further, especially as I'm really trying to translate from
<br />
personal modes that are often more visual/ kinaesthetic than verbal,
<br />
gestalt than analytic.
<br />
<br />I have these very same difficulties and I try my very hardest to use the
<br />
minimal number of most-accessible words in their popular mode. Not always
<br />
successfully...but you have to start somewhere. My origins are as an
<br />
engineer immersed in the natural (electrical) world. Thousands of hours of
<br />
waiting during commissioning, thinking for a couple of decades.... to
<br />
surface and try to describe what you have seen after this...is a
<br />
challenge.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That said, I rather like your 'adverbial' mode, which I think has also
</em><br />
cropped up in other contexts (didn't Whitehead attempt something of the
<br />
sort with his process view?) Nominalisation/ reification creates
<br />
conceptual confusions, embedded assumptions spawn others, as in all
<br />
language to do with time, which is already loaded with the assumption of
<br />
experiential dynamism, and hence can do nothing to help explain it.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
================================================
<br />
ASIDE, for the record, dual aspect science (from the previous post).  I)
<br />
APPEARANCE ASPECT. Depictions (statistics) of regularity (correlations of
<br />
agreed 'objects' within) in appearances
<br />
II) STRUCTURE ASPECT. Depictions (Statistics) of structure of an
<br />
underlying natural world based on organisations of one or more posited
<br />
structural primitives.
<br />
<br />Both have equal access to qualia as evidence. Qualia are evidence for
<br />
both. Whatever the structure is, scientists are made of it and it must
<br />
simultaneously a) deliver qualia and all the rest of the structure in the
<br />
universe(II) and b) deliver the contents of qualia (appearances) that
<br />
result in our correlations of appearances that we think of as empirical
<br />
laws(I). This is a complete consistent set of natural laws, none of which
<br />
literally 'are' the universe but are merely 'about' it.
<br />
================================================
<br />
back to David's words re language...'adverbial' descriptions:
<br />
<br />Nicholas Rescher has wrested process thought from the Whitehead
<br />
sequestration of it. Rescher uses the adverbial mode quite convincingly in
<br />
his latest works. Thank goodness...far too much religious/cultish detritus
<br />
smattered throughout the Whitehead camp. They have no right to 'own' the
<br />
process view. I hope those days are over now.
<br />
<br />The adverbial depiction is very apt as it stops us being deluded into the
<br />
assumption of 'nouns' and 'things'. In day to day life nouns and things
<br />
are very very useful, but the assumption that just because our language
<br />
has them and we have agreed to their presence in the universe's
<br />
appearance...does not mean that the language tokens are actually
<br />
instantiated!
<br />
<br />Adverbial descriptions are far more general in that they easily unify all
<br />
natural world behaviour as a single process that can deal with 'verby
<br />
things' like rainstorms, that are inherently processual and apparent lumpy
<br />
things (like lions) that behave 'nounly'. Qualia naturally fit into this
<br />
idea. There is no thing 'red' in your head. The universe is behaving
<br />
red-ly in your head. NOTE: An ideal object 'red' may be said to exist in
<br />
'platonia'. But so what! This is about _our_ universe, not some
<br />
abstraction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My own hastily contrived usages were an attempt to expose the implicit
</em><br />
(and hence generally conceptually invisible) holding of the world 'at
<br />
arm's length' by the objectifying effect of 3rd person language, which
<br />
simultaneusly relegates 1st-person to a subsidiary role, to the extent
<br />
that some even feel impelled to deny its existence, or resort to bizarre
<br />
ontolgies in an attempt to 'reintroduce' it. Where McGinn and Chomsky hold
<br />
that it is the analytic/ synthetic modes of language that puts 1st person
<br />
beyond our ability to conceptualise, I feel that the
<br />
unacknowledged consensual projection of an 'objective model' as
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'reality' has more to do with it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My belief has been that restoring 1st person to some sort of centrality
</em><br />
would be part of the antidote, and I haven't yet (quite) lost hope on this
<br />
score. I look forward to the fruits of your own efforts in this regard.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David
</em><br />
<br />Your plea has not gone unheard. V.S. Ramachandran said &quot;...the need to
<br />
reconcile the first and third person accounts of the universe...is the
<br />
single most important problem in science.&quot; (Phantoms in the Brain .229)
<br />
<br />and there's McGinn in 'the mysterious flame' where he makes a convincing
<br />
case for us having a profoundly inadequate view of matter. I agree! I'd
<br />
say there isn't any such 'thing'! :-)
<br />
<br />Note Ramachandran is not saying 'physics' or 'neuroscience' or
<br />
'consciousness studies' is affected but SCIENCE, all of it. He is
<br />
absolutely right. Qualia are our entire source of scientific evidence. We
<br />
have nothing else. They are an appearance (as a measurement supplied to us
<br />
inside our heads by the action of brain material). To say that the
<br />
universe is literally constructed of these appearances is a) illogical and
<br />
b) does not align with the modern empirical evidence of brain material.
<br />
<br />To
<br />
<br />a) be completely dependent on 1st person data for scientific evidence
<br />
(even though we linguistically extract an apparent objective agreed view
<br />
out of it, without qualia we have no appearances to do that with!)
<br />
<br />and
<br />
<br />b) demand that this 1st person data be used as evidence on pain of being
<br />
declared 'unscientific'. (If you can't experience it, you are not doing
<br />
science).
<br />
<br />and then
<br />
<br />c) To believe that the abstractions we get by correlating the appearances
<br />
are structural/causal
<br />
<br />and worse then
<br />
<br />d) to deny the existence qualia/declare the ficticious third person view
<br />
as the only valid view
<br />
<br />in spite of
<br />
<br />d) glaring anomalous data presentation in brain material.
<br />
<br />is a recipe for a science that I'm not too sure has any other status than
<br />
some sort of &quot;cult of the objective view&quot;. Do we really want to have
<br />
historians look back at us and cringe? The dual-aspect penny has to drop
<br />
at some stage.
<br />
<br />Qualia(appearances) are only intractible because we keep insisting on &amp;
<br />
trying to use qualia (appearances, our scientific evidence) to explain
<br />
them! Is it only me that sees that when the scientific evidence system
<br />
(qualia) is applied to collect evidence in favour of a &quot;science of
<br />
qualia&quot;, a science of _our evidence system_!!, that the evidence system
<br />
breaks down?
<br />
<br />If I had to categorise the situation I'd say that science is currently 
<br />
&quot;single aspect, unsituated&quot; as opposed to &quot;dual-aspect, situated&quot;.
<br />
<br />FYI
<br />
['unsituated' means that the scientist is, despite the observer dependence
<br />
characterised by quantum mechanics, surgically excised from the universe
<br />
by the demand for an objective view that does not exist. 'Situated'
<br />
science puts the scientist back inside the universe with the studied
<br />
items. Note that science only needs OBJECTIVITY (a behaviour) not a real
<br />
'objective view' to construct correlations of type I (above). Dual aspect
<br />
science disposes of the cultish need for a delusion of a 3rd person view ]
<br />
<br />I'd be very interested in the group's view on this. I feel like I'm the
<br />
only one who can see something broken here (science). If anyone can say
<br />
that a dual-aspect approach cannot be used for any other reason than
<br />
dogmatic clinging to the way it is,
<br />
<br />a) I'd like to hear it.. (I challenge anyone/everyone to do this. I can't!)
<br />
b) don't we have some breakthough thinking of some sort to be getting on
<br />
with?
<br />
<br />Wouldn't it be nice to be part of a solution instead of endless circular
<br />
ruminations that are the problem?
<br />
<br />Colin Hales
<br />
p.s. some physicists already are already working in the structure (II)
<br />
aspect... and they don't realise it. We are already doing it! We just
<br />
don;t know when we are.
