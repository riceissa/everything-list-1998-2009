I speculated:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I guess that you would say that if the unused
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; counterfactual machinery would actually work if tested, then she is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conscious; but if the counterfactual machines were broken or blocked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; such that they wouldn't work (even though they are not used) then she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is unconscious.  And perhaps you can say that the machines are in fact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; tested in other branches of the multiverse, so the criterion is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than merely a hypothetical difference between unused working machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and unused broken machines.  I see some difficulties with this position
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but I better first hear whether this is what you have in mind before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; trying to extrapolate further.
</em><br />
<br />Russell replied:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is indeed my meaning. What difficulties do you see?
</em><br />
<br />I see a few problems.  The first is the concept that the multiverse
<br />
will contain copies of the machine that execute the counterfactuals.
<br />
While this could happen, it would normally be to a very, very tiny degree,
<br />
and it seems highly implausible that this could cause any actual effects.
<br />
<br />In the case of Maudlin's thought experiment, the intention of the operator
<br />
is to run the machine on the specific inputs that it is pre-programmed
<br />
to handle.  In effect, it is doing a replay of a previously computed
<br />
calculation.  The counterfactual machinery is not intended to be
<br />
activated.  All of the effort and skill of the operator will be devoted
<br />
to pre-setting the machine into the precise state necessary for an
<br />
exact replay, as Maudlin describes in detail.
<br />
<br />Your interpretation depends on there being worlds in the multiverse
<br />
where these circumstances do not hold.  But the only way such a world
<br />
could exist is if the operator somehow fails to achieve his goal.
<br />
The measure of such worlds, if the operator is skillful and effective,
<br />
will be extremely tiny.  Only in worlds where the machine breaks or the
<br />
operator makes a mistake (or perhaps the operator's brain malfunctions
<br />
so he changes his mind about what to do) will the counterfactuals be
<br />
explored.
<br />
<br />My problem is that such worlds are so few and so remote from the
<br />
great majority of worlds where the machine is operating as designed,
<br />
i.e. without triggering the counterfactual mechanisms, that it is hard
<br />
to see how the presence of consciousness could depend on activity
<br />
in those worlds.  We might also note that those worlds are causally
<br />
disconnected from the one in question due to decoherence, and again
<br />
it seems questionable how a real phenomenon like consciousness can be
<br />
affected by what is happening in another universe.
<br />
<br />Now, we would do an experiment which was designed to more effectively test
<br />
and exercise the machine in a mode where it would seem more plausible
<br />
to say that the multiverse was testing the counterfactuals.  We could
<br />
in effect treat Olympia as a quantum computer, somehow initializing it
<br />
in a superposition of states, both the replay state and the many states
<br />
which would trigger counterfactuals, and then let it run like that.
<br />
In that case it would make more sense to say that the multiverse was
<br />
testing the counterfactuals and perhaps to say that the presence or
<br />
absence of consciousness was dependent on what happens across the
<br />
many worlds in this superposition.  But that is not the usual case of
<br />
exercising Olympia.  Instead, it is put, as certainly as we are able,
<br />
into a single initial state.  If there do appear variations in the
<br />
multiverse it is unintentional, and such variations will be remote and
<br />
of small measure.
<br />
<br />A related problem is that if we do consider the entirety of the
<br />
multiverse, undoubtedly there will be corners where virtually anything
<br />
happens.  In a normal run of the Olympia machine augmented with the
<br />
counterfactuals, indeed if we look hard enough we can find corners of the
<br />
multiverse where the counterfactuals are explored, as just discussed.
<br />
Perhaps on this basis you want to say that the machine is conscious.
<br />
But what if we have blocked the counterfactual mechanism as Maudlin
<br />
described?  You probably want to say that the machine is unconscious now.
<br />
Yet there are corners of the multiverse where the blockage fails and
<br />
the counterfactual mechanism continues to operate.  Doesn't that mean
<br />
that in fact the machine should be conscious, after all?
<br />
<br />In general, there will be all kinds of variations happening throughout
<br />
the multiverse.  There will be worlds where the counterfactuals are
<br />
tested and they work, but also worlds where the counterfactuals are
<br />
tested and they fail (due to blockage or just plain broken machinery).
<br />
In yet other worlds the machine may fail or misbehave in any number of
<br />
bizarre ways.  It could even implement a different calculation, perhaps
<br />
even a different consciousness, elsewhere in the multiverse.
<br />
<br />My basic problem is that the multiverse is so big, and so much variation
<br />
is possible, that it will not work to say that consciousness depends on
<br />
activity that is spread across the multiverse.  If you try to pin it down
<br />
so that it depends on what happens merely on a particular world and its
<br />
near neighbors, then that will not in general test the counterfactuals.
<br />
If you expand it to include a wide range of possibilities, then there
<br />
is too much going on, too many variations and bizarre outcomes, so
<br />
that the criteria you are trying to use for consiciousness are met in
<br />
some worlds and contradicted in others.  All in all I don't think this
<br />
approach will work as a general method for making consciousness supervene
<br />
on physicality.
