<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pasts for a particular present&quot; is not a reality.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Some historians think the Roman Empire fell because of lead in their

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; plumbing&quot; sorts of theories of the past. I am referring to space-time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; events.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As noted, I also view time and events as a lattice. But lattices have

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; certain properties of importance here. More on this later.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; --Tim May

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you mean by this, exactly? In a deterministic universe with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time-symmetric laws, there'd be only one possible past history for a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given present state, and only one future history as well, while in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe with stochastic laws, or deterministic laws in which paths in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phase space could converge, there might be multiple past histories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would lead to exactly the same present state.
</em><br />
<br />I think the number of multiple past histories (other than the _actual_ 
<br />
one) which &quot;lead to exactly the same present state&quot; is as close to zero 
<br />
as one would like to calculate.
<br />
<br />As to why there is only a single past but multiple futures, this is 
<br />
implicit in the measurement process.  (I doubt you will find this 
<br />
convincing unless I expand on this.)
<br />
<br />Consider the &quot;There will be a sea battle next year&quot; proposition, the 
<br />
favorite of the Stoics and Aristotle.  Unknown at this time, and few 
<br />
prospects for computation. Determinism is not very supportable, 
<br />
especially at full detail.
<br />
<br />And yet the proposition &quot;There was a sea battle at Jutland during World 
<br />
War II&quot; is answerable. And all will agree on that answer.
<br />
<br />The future is not knowable, the past is not disputable.
<br />
<br />This arises with quantum measurements of course. Once a measurement is 
<br />
made--path of a photon, for example--all honest observers will report 
<br />
exactly the same thing. There simply is no basis for disputing the 
<br />
past, for Alice to say &quot;I saw the photon travel through the left slit&quot; 
<br />
but for Bob to say &quot;I saw it travel through the right slit.&quot;
<br />
<br />(If I am wrong on this, please correct me ASAP!)
<br />
<br />Honest observers will report the same outcomes of measurements, whether 
<br />
those measurements are of photons in slits or sea battles.
<br />
<br />This shows up in the formalism of lattices, especially the orthomodular 
<br />
lattices of quantum mechanics.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, in quantum mechanics it's not even clear that we can talk 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the &quot;present state of the universe&quot; as if it's a well-defined 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entity, in which case it may not make sense to ask whether &quot;the&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present has multiple pasts or multiple futures. A MWI advocate would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say we could talk about the present state of the universal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wavefunction, but that's different from the present state of an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual &quot;world&quot;--I believe there's a fair amount of controversy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about what people even mean by &quot;worlds&quot; in the MWI. With a hidden 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables interpretation of QM you can talk about the universe's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; present state, but the exact details of the present state would always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be unknowable.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;From an instrumentalist point of view, the state of an experiment (or 
<br />
of the universe) is recorded by the set of measurements made.
<br />
<br />I'm not saying things are not weird...QM by any interpretation gives 
<br />
results not in accord with our &quot;realist&quot; intuition. (E.g., the quantum 
<br />
box with an animal which may have one door opened to reveal whether 
<br />
it's a dog or a cat or the other door opened to reveal whether its a 
<br />
male or a female, but never both at the same time and never even 
<br />
sequentially so that one first opens one door, sees a dog, opens the 
<br />
second door, sees a male. In the ordinary world, both doors are 
<br />
openable, either simultaneously or sequentially, and things are as we 
<br />
would expect them to be. Not so with quantum things, modulo 
<br />
entanglement decoherence, etc.)
<br />
<br />Even at the &quot;present&quot; the universe will not have a &quot;defined past,&quot; as 
<br />
delayed choice experiments show. But I would argue that those delayed 
<br />
choice &quot;in limbo&quot; states are not part of the causal past, at least not 
<br />
yet. That dog or cat, male or female, is not yet part of our causal 
<br />
past (in fact, were an outcome to interact with other lattice events in 
<br />
any way at all, this would constitute a &quot;measurement&quot;).
<br />
<br />Rereading my paragraphs, maybe they are unclear. It takes entire 
<br />
chapters of books (I like David Albert's book, or Smolin's &quot;Life of the 
<br />
Cosmos&quot; (from whence the cat and dog example was taken), Bub, Hughes, 
<br />
and Barrett) to talk about these things, so my paragraphs are doing the 
<br />
ideas justice.
<br />
<br />What I'll say is that there is indeed an asymmetry in what we &quot;know&quot; 
<br />
(have measured, recorded, seen) about the past versus what we don't 
<br />
know about the future. I'm not a supporter of &quot;block time,&quot; a la Huw 
<br />
Price and others.
