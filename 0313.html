<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd like to insist again that there is no precise meaning of the question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether &quot;you&quot; exist or not in some world. The notion of identity exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only because of your memory, and implies a sufficiently classical evolution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the world for this memory to be conserved. This is a problem for QS,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which I did not realize at once. The branching event following a quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurement is by far the most rapid event we can conceive, since its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; duration decreases exponentially with the number of particles. This is much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more rapid than any &quot;mechanical&quot; process like the triggering of a gun
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (unless you could realize a vacuum instability that would propagate at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speed of light and destroy the whole observable universe. Does anybody know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how?).
</em><br />
<br />It's not clear that branching is an &quot;event&quot; as such.  It is more of a
<br />
process, a constant, continual process of splitting.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So before tempting any suicide, you are already split in two (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more) components. For the part of you that has been branched on the wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way, the suicide attempt has almost no chance to transport&quot; or couple you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the &quot;right &quot; world. It will couple you most probably to a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compatible with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1) your own survival and 2) with the greatest measure.
</em><br />
<br />I see identity in a larger sense.  Consider the example proposed
<br />
by Jacques, where the universe is infinitely large, and there are an
<br />
infinite number of exact, perfect, indistinguishable copies of me spread
<br />
throughout the universe.  (Each of those copies exists within a region
<br />
of space, billions of light years across, which is observationally
<br />
indistinguishable from our own.)
<br />
<br />I would consider &quot;my identity&quot; to encompass all of those beings, infinite
<br />
in number, whose mental states are exactly the same as my own.  There is
<br />
no meaning to the question, &quot;which one am I?&quot;  All of us think that in
<br />
unison.
<br />
<br />Or consider Wei's experiment, where we have an intelligent computer program
<br />
and it is running synchronized on two computers.  I would say that the
<br />
identity of the computer program is instantiated equally on both
<br />
computers.
<br />
<br />Now, suppose in the computer case that we flip a coin, and we will give
<br />
one of the computer programs a bad experience, and one of them a good
<br />
experience.  We flip the coin and it turns out that the computer on the
<br />
left will get the bad experience.  However, it has an automated system
<br />
which, upon seeing the coin flip, automatically shuts off that computer.
<br />
The computer program itself is not aware of the results of the coin flip.
<br />
<br />This is analogous to quantum suicide where you have arranged an automated
<br />
system to kill you when something bad happens (say, you failed to win the
<br />
lottery), but before you become aware of the result.
<br />
<br />We would probably agree that the consciousness of the computer will
<br />
never experience being shut down.  I would further say that there is no
<br />
change in its experience from the shut down; as far as its consciousness
<br />
is concerned, it always experiences the good result from the coin flip
<br />
and never the bad result.
<br />
<br />It is not a matter of consciousness &quot;transporting&quot; from one computer to
<br />
the other.  Rather, with both computers in identical states, there is
<br />
nothing to distinguish one computer's instantiation of consciousness
<br />
from the other's.  The consciousness is not aware of how many computers
<br />
it is instantiated on.  So when one stops, it makes no difference.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It may be a universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where you survive miraculously without sequels, or one where you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; severely injured and where you may not like to live!. It may also be one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where &quot;you&quot; lost totally the memory of your past, because the worlds where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this condition is satisfied have a measure null or negligible. so in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense &quot;you&quot; is no more &quot;you&quot;. So if you know that the gun is going to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; triggered, for example by some alarm; it would be a good idea to stop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; immediately this experiment...If you are not convinced, what do you think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a &quot;delayed&quot; suicide experiment where you wait for one day before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; triggering the gun?
</em><br />
<br />At any given time, what you will experience is among the least unlikely
<br />
events which allow you to stay alive, and which are consistent with your
<br />
conscious state.  If you don't know what the results are of the lottery,
<br />
and if your suicide machine is sufficiently reliable, then the least
<br />
unlikely event is that you won the lottery.  If you know that you didn't
<br />
win the lottery then the least unlikely event may be some of the outcomes
<br />
you describe: the suicide machine may break; you may turn out to be insane
<br />
(this is the outcome in Greg Egan's novel Permutation City); you may be
<br />
injured rather than killed, etc.
