<br /><br />Just because it is not a human interpreter, but a programming language

interpreter. I use the term in the computer science sense.

</em><br />
<br /><br />Usually I use &quot;Arithmetic&quot; for the (usual) standard interpretation (in  
<br />
the human sense) of arithmetic. By arithmetic I was thinking of a  
<br />
formal system such as the formal system Robinson Arithmetic (or Peano  
<br />
Arithmetic depending on the context).
<br />
<br />It is not so easy to show that Robinson Arithmetic is a Turing  
<br />
Universal interpreter, but it is standardly done in most good textbook  
<br />
in mathematical logic(*). It is no more extraordinary that the Turing  
<br />
universality of the SK combinators, or the universality of the  
<br />
Conway's game of life, or the universality of any little universal  
<br />
system.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how does arithmetic avoid the problem of arbitrarily many mappings, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; raised by Stathis?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Once you accept the computationalist hypothesis, not only that problem  
<br />
is not avoided but the problems of the existence of both physical laws  
<br />
and consciousness is entirely reduced to it, or to the digital version  
<br />
(UD) version of that problem. The collection of all computations is a  
<br />
well defined computational object, already existing or defined by a  
<br />
tiny part of Arithmetical Truth, and not depending on the choice of  
<br />
the initial basic formal system.
<br />
<br />The mapping are well defined though. The way Putnam, Mallah, Chalmers  
<br />
and others put that problem just makes no sense with comp, given that  
<br />
they postulated some primitively material or substantial universe  
<br />
which does not makes any sense (as I have argued already). Then they  
<br />
confuse a computation with a description of a computation. Sometimes  
<br />
they use also the idea that real numbers occurs actually in nature  
<br />
which just add confusion. Now I usually don't insist on that, because,  
<br />
even if such mapping would make sense, it just add computational  
<br />
histories in the universal dovetailing, or in Arithmetic, and this  
<br />
does not change the measure problem. The only important fact here is  
<br />
that with comp, the digitalness makes the measure problem well  
<br />
defined: none mappings are arbitrary: either there is a computation or  
<br />
there is no computation.
<br />
For example, with numbers and succession (but without addition and  
<br />
multiplication) there is no universal computation, even if there is a  
<br />
sense to say there is all description of computations there. A  
<br />
counting algorithm does not constitute a universal dovetailing. Now,  
<br />
numbers + addition + multiplication, gives universal computations and  
<br />
thus all computations with its typical super-redundancy, and the  
<br />
measure problem makes sense. Ontologically we need no more.  
<br />
Epistemologically we need *much* more, we need something so big that  
<br />
even with the whole &quot;Cantor Paradise&quot; or the whole &quot;Plato Heaven&quot; at  
<br />
our disposition we will not even been able to name what we need (and  
<br />
that is how comp prevents first person reductionism or eliminativism,  
<br />
and how it makes theology needing a scientific endeavor). (with  
<br />
science = hypothetical axiomatics).
<br />
<br />I agree with Kelly that we don't need a notion of causality, but we  
<br />
need computations (Shannon information measures only a degree of  
<br />
surprise, and consciousness is more general than being surprised, and  
<br />
I agree with you that information is a statical notion). But the  
<br />
notion of computations needs the logical relations existing among  
<br />
numbers, although other basic finite entities can be used in the place  
<br />
of numbers. In all case, the computations exists through the logical  
<br />
relations among those finite entities.
<br />
<br />We could say that a state A access to a state B if there is a  
<br />
universal machine (a universal number relation) transforming A into B.  
<br />
This works at the ontological level, or for the third person point of  
<br />
view. But if A is a consciousness related state, then to evaluate the  
<br />
probability of personal access to B, you have to take into account  
<br />
*all* computations going from A to B, and thus you have to take into  
<br />
account the infinitely many universal number relations transforming A  
<br />
into B. Most of them are indiscernible by &quot;you&quot; because they differ  
<br />
below &quot;your&quot; substitution level.
