</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Copying is such a bonus that it swamps consideration of quality of life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In a world where people have adapted to copying, they would work as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;hard to make a copy as they would in our world to avoid dying (each one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;changes measure by plus or minus 100%).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think so.  If you (and your copies) 90yrs old and infirm, would you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to make another copy?  Consider the alternative of making a clone of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yourself.  A clone would be young and have a full life ahead.  So beyond some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; age you would probably prefer a clone to a copy.  Then you can relate this to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having children, since having a child is, biologically speaking, have half a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clone.  Do people work hard to have as many children as possible?  No.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biological drive is to have sex - not children.
</em><br />
<br />That makes sense, but it is consistent with what I wrote.  I said that
<br />
a person would work as hard to make a copy as to avoid dying.  You are
<br />
right that a 90 year old sick person might not care so much about having
<br />
a copy compared to other alternatives.  But by the same token, he would
<br />
not care so much about dying either.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One might suppose that a genetic disposition to have clones might spread and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; become dominant thru differential reproduction.  And maybe it would in modern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; industrial society.  But we know it didn't in the development of life on Earth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sexual reproduction had the advantage.
</em><br />
<br />I think if you look at percentage of Earth biomass you will find
<br />
that the majority is in simple, single-cell organisms which largely
<br />
reproduce asexually.  In a way, large multi-cellular animals like us
<br />
represent an exotic and not very successful offshoot from the larger
<br />
portion of Earth biology.  So perhaps sex is overrated in terms of its
<br />
reproductive advantages.
