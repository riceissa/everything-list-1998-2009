<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The current &quot;seventh step series&quot; is leading to the understanding of

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; what is a computation, and a machine, for a mathematician. With or

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of computation and of computability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ah.  Well, tell me if you still want to make the point about my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'paragraph above', after my response on this.  But on the issue of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of what is computation, I must concede that I have much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to learn technically - so I will be humble and try to study.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But also - just to dispose once and for all of this particular point -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to be sure that you understand that I'm not arguing *for*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eliminative materialism, except as devil's advocate (I'm sure you know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this).  But one aspect of my recent discussions with Peter has been to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bring to a focus the strict consequences of materialism, in precisely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the honest way that you attribute to Dennett.  The trouble is, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dennett, having eliminated the mind and hence the notorious 'problem',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still cheerfully carries on deploying the same mind-dependent concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as though nothing had happened!  In other words, his position is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inconsistent and incoherent.  It's dualism for free!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. I think that Dennett agrees too, as he almost confesses at  
<br />
the end of his book on &quot;Consciousness Explained&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, in this context, let me try to understand your remark: &quot;with or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without assuming PM (primitive matter) there is an mathematical notion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of computation and of computability&quot;.  I would say - per Dennett, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understood *consistently* - that under the assumption that there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *only* primitive matter (i.e. material monism) - there strictly can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no appeal to such a notion as computation, because mathematics itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is eliminable per Qine.  Don't misunderstand me - this is what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *wrong* with material monism - because to be consistent, one is either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; honestly forced to such an eliminativist conclusion (but then you must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deny your own consciousness and all mental concepts), or you tacitly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accept a form of dualism (but again without noticing!)  So I suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that when you say &quot;with primitive matter&quot; that you don't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;**only** with primitive matter&quot;, but rather &quot;with primitive matter +
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation&quot; - which is in effect a dualistic assumption.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually, once we assume some primitive matter, we are immediately  
<br />
confronted with what Jacques Mallah called (in this list) the  
<br />
implementation problem (also treated by Putnam and Chalmers). It is  
<br />
even made worse with quantum computations. There is a sense to say  
<br />
that the quantum vacuum implements all computations, and there is a  
<br />
real difficulty in relating particular computation and particular  
<br />
piece matter, and that is  a prerequisite to attach mind to matter for  
<br />
a partisan of PM+CTM.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; please don't misunderstand me - I regard comp as a coherent *monistic*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach to both mind and matter that seeks to 'eliminate' neither,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and which brings the mind-body issues into full focus. But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption of PM *in addition* would transform it into a type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epiphenomenal dualism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well I think that the addition of PM to CTM leads to contradiction or  
<br />
elimination of consciousness (not a reduction of consciousness to  
<br />
physical activity, but real elimination). What Peter seems to have  
<br />
some difficulty to understand or admit.
<br />
Now, with a theory which assumes that CTM is false, you can coherently  
<br />
define an identity thesis matter-mind (with enough actual infinities  
<br />
on both sides), and defend some epiphenomenal dualism. With CTM  
<br />
epiphenomenalism, for *primitive* matter, does not work.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The notion of computation does not rely on anything physical.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, with the caveats above.
</em><br />
<br /><br />And there is nothing metaphysical here, just a tremendous mathematical  
<br />
discovery made by Emil Post, the first, and rediscovered by Kleene,  
<br />
Turing, Markov and some others. (To be frank, I don't believe Church  
<br />
ever makes that discovery. It is really Kleene who realized that  
<br />
Church &quot;definition&quot; was a really a thesis. But since Kleene introduced  
<br />
the vocable &quot;Church's thesis&quot;, mathematical logicians are using it.  
<br />
Many call it &quot;Church-Turing thesis&quot; nowadays. But historically it is  
<br />
either Emil Post who made the discovery the first, or perhaps Babbage,  
<br />
who, when getting old, invented a language to describe his machine,  
<br />
and discovered that the language was already an universal beast as  
<br />
clever as his machine).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think that what remains unclear in step seven is due to the lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge of that &quot;purely mathematical&quot; notion of computation. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; need it to justify why Universal Machine and Universal Dovetailer&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist and in what sense they are truly universal.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Point taken.  I will try to learn.
</em><br />
<br />It is very kind to tell me, and to provide me with supplementary  
<br />
motivations. I am a bit slow down by some amount of work to finish in  
<br />
August. I give you the time to catch up, but I think I have to make  
<br />
some summary, and I don't know how to do with Kim and Marty. Johnathan  
<br />
told me that silence means assent, but in math, it is not always the  
<br />
case. You can tell  the math teacher, that your silence is assent,  
<br />
during the course, but not during the exams, for example  :)
