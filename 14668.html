Great reference, thanks!
<br />
<br />I'm investigating a problem I can phrase two ways, given that the 
<br />
category of MV-algebras is equivalent to the category of lattice-ordered 
<br />
Abelian groups with a distinguished strong unit.
<br />
So one way to phrase my question, and I'm guess it has been answered 
<br />
before....
<br />
<br />Take LOAGDSU to be the set of wffs that define lattice-ordered Abelian 
<br />
groups with a distinguished strong unit.  Now consider the collection of 
<br />
all models of LOAGDSU.  The question I have to anyone who knows is this: 
<br />
How many nonisomophic models can (the completion of) LOAGDSU have?
<br />
<br />I might be redundant there if the theory generated by the wffs in 
<br />
LOAGDSU is already complete (I haven't looked into that aspect today 
<br />
yet).  Either way, for the ease of expression, let's say that my 
<br />
question is this: How many nonisomophic models can LOAGDSU have?
<br />
<br />Are any of them in an interesting sense non-standard, such as so called 
<br />
nonstandard models of arithmetic can give rise to a 'realm' that all 
<br />
natural numbers are in and other 'things' are in this realm that are in 
<br />
every other way elementarily equivalent to the usual model of (N, +, ., 
<br />
&lt;  ), yet these unlimited numbers are larger than every standard natural 
<br />
number.  Hyper-natural numbers these are called.  My point is, do 
<br />
non-standard models of LOAGDSU exist and what is even standard about 
<br />
LOAGDSU that could be pushed into a &quot;non-standard line of thought.&quot;
<br />
<br />But the main question is how many non-isomorphic models can LOAGDSU have.
<br />
<br /><br />In other news, I will try to apply to give a presentation on the 
<br />
promising connections between logic, algebra, and the muh in physics at 
<br />
this conference:
<br />
<a href="http://www.mat.unisi.it/~latd2008/">http://www.mat.unisi.it/~latd2008/</a>
<br />
<br />I just need to concoct the best 2 page abstract I can and submit it.  I 
<br />
am crossing my fingers.
<br />
<br /><br />Back to the point at hand.  Asking how many different models LOAGDSU has 
<br />
is in a natural way equivalent to asking how many models MV-algebra 
<br />
has.  THat is because of the theorems in chapter 7 of the book 
<br />
referenced in my preceding post about their realization that there is a 
<br />
deep connection between MV-algebras and those certain l-groups.
<br />
<br />When I think of the 'things', denoted with variables, in an MV-algebra I 
<br />
think those are elements in the truth set.  Ex/ in Classical Logic, the 
<br />
cardinality of the truth set is two.  When I think of the 'things', also 
<br />
denoted by letters, in these l-groups, I think of groups (which are 
<br />
containers).
<br />
<br />However, due to the deep and categorical connection between those two 
<br />
systems, and combine that with my suspicion that the universe mentioned 
<br />
in Tegmark's paper about the MUH, I then see 'things' in MV-algebras and 
<br />
l-groups (with equipment) as -worldlines- of other 'things'.  These 
<br />
structures, like MV-algebras, provide some of the laws of Physics as 
<br />
they would be under the MUH.
<br />
<br /><br />So I guess my next peek will be into what a standard model of the theory 
<br />
of MV-algebras is (like) and see if it would be fruitful to investigate 
<br />
nonstandard models of the theory of MV-algebras.
