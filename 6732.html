<P>From the initial page from the included link to the archive: "I'm no physicist so I don't know for sure that these implications would<BR>follow, but I am very doubtful that interworld communication is consistent<BR>with the basics of quantum mechanics.&nbsp; The fact that this paper has not<BR>been published in peer reviewed journals in 7 years indicates that it<BR>probably doesn't work."</P>
<P>Back when I wasn't long in the field of video production I was well aware of the insistance and belief of TV engineers that a single tube industrial color video camera was not broadcast quality. Working in cable, where they were used for cablecast, I had plenty of opportunity to look at picture quality, etc. and came to the conclusion that it shouldn't be a problem. 2 years later I got the chance to prove it when a local news station sent a crew out to cover something that I was shooting. In the end I gave them the&nbsp;editied sequence I had shot (now down&nbsp;two generations), and they took it and edited it into their story, which would have taken it down a third. Then they broadcasted it over the air. I taped it off-air and the results were conclusive - I was&nbsp;right, all the nay-sayer engineers were wrong.&nbsp;A $40,000 Ikegami&nbsp; vs a $1,500 Panasonic and it was a tie except for one slight red bleed from a costume due to the Saticon tube bias toward red in the camera I used, which could have been color corrected with a time base corrector, but whoever dubbed the tape left the red level a little too hot. </P>
<P>My point being that that was the first in a long line of "you can'ts" that I've faced which I eventually proved, "you can". Thus I have a dim view of such positions when they aren't backed up with experiments that prove so *conclusively*. As long as the possibility exists, I keep an open mind. Besides, if unbriddled skepticism was right all the time, we wouldn't be using computers, flying, or even have phones of any kind, just to name a few things.<BR><BR><BR>----- Original Message ----- <BR>From: hal.domain.name.hidden <BR>To: everything-list@eskimo.com <BR>Subject: Re: Plaga <BR>Date: Tue, 24 May 2005 17:51:13 -0700 (PDT) <BR><BR>&gt; <BR>&gt; We discussed Plaga's paper back in June, 2002.
