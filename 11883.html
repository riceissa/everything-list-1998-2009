<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps I should not have used the pejorative terms, but I think it is a fair question:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how do we know if a belief is crazy or stupid? Nature does not care about

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; epistemology, only about utility, and brains have evolved to process evidence and

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arrive at conclusions because it assists survival. Psychotic illness disrupts the normal

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasoning process and leads to delusions. The most important feature of these is not

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they are false, but that they occur as a result of a pathological process which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; leads to morbidity and sometimes mortality.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You make an interesting point about fixed *true* beliefs, not covered by the definition

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I gave below: it is actually possible to be right but still be delusional. For example, a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patient believes with utter conviction that his wife was having an affair with his neighbour 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the neighbour painted his fence green and green is her favourite colour.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The patient is treated with antipsychotic medication and after a few weeks realises that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it was crazy to come to the conclusion that he did and apologises to his wife and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neighbour, whom he had confronted prior to treatment. Months later, his wife leaves him 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the neighbour: it turns out that they had been having an affair all along! Nevertheless, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the patient had still been delusional because (a) most reasonable people would see the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclusion he drew from the green fence, and the conviction with which he held it, as very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dubious, and (b) he himself saw the conclusion as dubious after treatment with antipsychotic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; medication.

<br />This is an example of Edmund Gettier's theory of epistemology.  He pointed out that a true belief can't be  knowledge unless it has a causal relation to the thing believed.  His example was a man who thought his coworker had bought a new car because he saw him drive a new one to work.  In fact the man was trying out his son's car, but coincidentally he had bought a new car. He just didn't drive it to work.
