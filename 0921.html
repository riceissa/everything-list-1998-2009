Let me add my information to this confusing brew:

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My memory is fading somewhat about transfinite cardinal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; numbers. However, it seems to me that c \leq \aleph_1. \aleph_1 is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cardinality of the set of all sets of cardinalilty \leq\aleph_0. Since c
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is the cardinality of the set of all subsets of N, which is a subset
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the set of all sets of cardinality \leq\aleph_0.
</em><br />
<br />This is wrong, from what I know.  I agree with Hal below that aleph-1
<br />
is defined to be the &quot;next&quot; cardinal after aleph-0.  That is, by
<br />
definition, there is no transfinite number with cardinality &gt; aleph-0
<br />
and &lt; aleph-1.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What has never been proven is that c=\aleph_1, although it is widely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suspected.
</em><br />
<br />In fact it has been shown that c == aleph-1 is not provable by the
<br />
axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory.  This is known as the 
<br />
continuum hypothesis (CH).  CH is also not disprovable,
<br />
which means that it is independent of those axioms.  Thus it is 
<br />
possible to construct set theories which assume that ~CH, and these
<br />
are known as non-Cantorian set theories.  
<br />
<br />On the other hand, in standard set theory, assuming the CH does no
<br />
harm.
<br />
<br />[More below]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is pretty much over my head.  As I understand it aleph 1 is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined to be the next cardinal number after aleph 0, and can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shown to be the cardinality of the set of all countable ordinals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1...w...w+1...2w...w^2...).  Since the elements of this set are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordered sets (i.e. ordinals), while the subsets of N don't have an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ordering requirement, this gives more flexibility to c and so you can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compare them as simply as you have shown here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See <a href="http://www.ii.com/math/ch/">http://www.ii.com/math/ch/</a> for a detailed discussion of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matters.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually on further thought I think I was wrong to suggest that the number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of TM programs is c, since that would allow for infinite length programs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is perhaps outside the spirit of a TM.  If we require only finite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; length programs then the number of TMs is aleph 0 since we can enumerate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the programs, and that would be the number of universes as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not so many after all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hal

<br />I think you are right that the cardinality of the set of all programs
<br />
is aleph-0.
<br />
<br />But neither of you (nor anyone else) has addressed my reason for 
<br />
conjecturing that the set of branches in our structure must be
<br />
aleph-(aleph-0), which is based on the SSA.
<br />
<br />To tell you the truth, I'm certainly not convinced of it, but I
<br />
think it's worth considering.  To discard the conclusion, I would
<br />
think that you'd have to assume &quot;the identity of indiscernables&quot;.
<br />
My reasoning is illustrated if you only assume, for the moment,
<br />
that some observable (say, x) can take a continuum of possible
<br />
values when measured.  Forget about the Plank length, for now.
<br />
That would mean that the set of all possible humans would have
<br />
cardinality c (at least).  Thus it would be impossible to map
<br />
that set onto the set of all programs.
<br />
<br />But if you believe in the computationalist hypothesis, then you'd
<br />
have to assume that at some point, a simulation of a human becomes
<br />
&quot;close enough&quot; to be identical.  That is (to oversimplify) when
<br />
each particle is simulated to within a Plank length, then the 
<br />
simulation becomes indiscernable from the original, and thus
<br />
identical.  If this is true, then I would no longer expect the
<br />
physical laws to give rise to ever-increasing cardinality of
<br />
universes, since that could never increase the cardinality of
<br />
the set of humans past aleph-0, anyway.
