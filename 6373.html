<br />As I understand the explanation, what happens is that as the UD generates
<br />
programs, it inherently and unintentionally generates multiple copies of
<br />
each program. The reason is that each program has only a finite size.
<br />
If we think of the program as written in some kind of programming
<br />
language, only a finite number of the characters will be used.
<br />
Any characters beyond this ending point are never executed.
<br />
<br />This means that as the UD generates all character strings and begins
<br />
to execute them, a program which is n bits long gets created any time
<br />
the UD generates a string that starts with those particular n bits.
<br />
Each string which has those n bits as its prefix (the bits starting at
<br />
the beginning) will represent the same program.
<br />
<br />The UD can't detect this because a priori there is no way to tell how
<br />
long a particular program will turn out to be.  This is a corollary of
<br />
the Halting Problem, there is no way to tell by inspection how long a
<br />
program is.  So it has no choice but to multiply create programs in this
<br />
way.
<br />
<br />The result is that if we compare two programs, one n bits long and one
<br />
m bits long, where m &gt; n, we will find that the n bit one gets created
<br />
proportionally more times than the m bit one.  And in fact the constant
<br />
of proportionality is 2^(m-n).  This lets us define a &quot;measure&quot; for each
<br />
program that tells what fraction of all programs the UD creates are that
<br />
particular program.  That measure is 2^(-n) for an n bit program.
<br />
<br />Therefore, each program gets created an infinite number of times by the
<br />
UD, and the fraction of the whole ensemble of programs which consists
<br />
of a particular n bit program is 2^(-n).
<br />
<br />Note that this does not depend on any slowdown effect for larger programs;
<br />
that effect is not considered significant in this model because it is only
<br />
noticeable from outside and not from within the program being executed.
<br />
Rather, it depends on multiple creations of each program, and the fraction
<br />
of the whole infinite ensemble that each program represents.
