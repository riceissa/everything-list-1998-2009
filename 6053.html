<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that in a sense this IS happening, every moment of my life. Now, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose I am offered the following deal. In exchange for $1 million 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deposited in my bank account, tonight I will be killed with a sharp axe in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my sleep, and in the morning a stranger will wake up in my bed who has been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brainwashed and implanted with all my memories at my last conscious moment. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This stranger will also have had plastic surgery so that he looks like me, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and he will then live life as me, among other things spending the $1 million 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is now in my bank account.
</em><br />
<br />That's an interesting thought experiment.  I think the problem is that
<br />
given human psychology, any such brainwashing is almost certain to be
<br />
superficial and not to duplicate the deep mental structures which are
<br />
part of our identity.  The guy who wakes up in bed is still going to be
<br />
a stranger, who merely resembles you in some ways.
<br />
<br />If we imagine instead that we are living voluntarily as members of a
<br />
computer simulation (&quot;uploads&quot;), then it would be possible to actually
<br />
have the stranger's mind be an exact copy of your own.  However, in
<br />
that case the copy would be so exact that there really isn't any sense
<br />
in which you have been replaced by a stranger.  The &quot;stranger&quot; would
<br />
really be you, if he had the exact same mind and body as represented
<br />
in the computer simulation.
<br />
<br />You could arbitrarily induce various levels of change in the copied
<br />
mind, so that you would have a continuum from an exact copy, to one with
<br />
some exceedingly small changes, to one which would be about as good as
<br />
a brainwashed human being, to some that would be entirely different.
<br />
Then I'm not sure what the sensible approach is as far as how much money
<br />
to demand in exchange for such an alteration.
<br />
<br />After all, the money doesn't spring into existence, it is transferred
<br />
from one person to another.  From the larger perspective, why should
<br />
you care about helping one human being over another?  Once you start to
<br />
think of the person waking up in bed as an arbitrary human being, who
<br />
might or might not happen to resemble you, it becomes harder to adopt
<br />
the identity-centric viewpoint where you only root for the one guy who is
<br />
&quot;you&quot;.
<br />
<br />If you think of identity as an illusion, as many of these thought
<br />
experiments seem to suggest, all we can fall back on is a universal
<br />
altruism, where our goal is to maximize the total happiness of conscious
<br />
entities.  Such a goal is largely immune to these paradoxes, although
<br />
it does have some problems of its own.
