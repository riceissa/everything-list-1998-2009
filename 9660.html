<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Yes, sharing the memory is *not* the same as having the original experience, but this applies to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; recalling one's own past as well. You may argue that recalling our past is different because we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; have just the right brain structure, other associated memories and so on to put it all in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; context, but in principle all of these might be lacking due to illness or the passage of time, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; might be duplicated in a very good simulation made for someone else to experience. The only way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; to unambiguously define a first person experience is to make it once only; perfect recollection
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; would be indistinguishable from the original experience, and it would be impossible for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; experiencer to either know that he was recalling a memory or to know how close to the original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; the recollection was. The postulate of a first person entity persisting through time violates the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 1st person/ 3rd person distinction, since it assumes that I-now can have 1st person knowledge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I-yesterday or I-tomorrow, when in fact such knowledge is impossible except in a 3rd person way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; I believe it is this confusion which leads to the apparent anomaly of 1st person indeterminacy in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; the face of 3rd person determinacy in duplication experiments. Let us assume as little as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; possible and make our theories as simple as possible. I *have* to accept that there is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; special about my experiences at the moment which distinguish them from everyone else's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; experiences: this is the difference between the 1st person POV and the 3rd person POV. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; tempting to say that my 1st person POV extends into the future and the past as well, explaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; why I think of myself as a person persisting through time. However, this latter hypothesis is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; unnecessary. It is enough to say that the 1st person POV is valid only in the present, and when I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; consider my future and past that is only 3rd person extrapolation. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Well said!  I agree completely.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thank-you!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt;What I consider myself to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; as a person is then explained as the set of 1st person experiences related in a particular way,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; such as believing themselves to be moments in the life of a single individual, having memories or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt; quasi-memories in common, and so on. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what can that &quot;related in a particular way&quot; be?  It is certainly not the case that I, at every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment am experiencing a belief that I'm a single individual.  I cannot think of any 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience that is connecting my 1st person moments.  Rather it is something unconscious which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; &quot;experience&quot; only on reflection, i.e. in a 3rd person way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think this poses a difficulty for a world model consisting only of &quot;observer moments&quot;.  There's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to connect them.  A model in which there is an external substrate, either the physical world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or a computer simulation, avoids this problem by providing the unexperienced connection.  Julian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Barbour proposes a similar model in which the world consists of &quot;time capsules&quot;; each capsule is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moment in time.  But these capsules contain much more than a conscious thought; they contain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like a state of the world and so they provide enough information to be well ordered.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think it is one of the most profound things about consciousness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that observer moments don't *need* anything to connect them other than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their content. They are linked like the novels in a series, not like the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; carriages of a train. It is not necessary that the individual novels be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lined up specially on a shelf: as long as they have each been written 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and exist somewhere in the world, the series exists. 
</em><br />
<br />But the series exists, as a series, by virtue of the information in them.  They are like Barbour's 
<br />
time-capsules; each contains enough references and characters from the others to allow them to be 
<br />
put into order.  It's not clear to me what duration &quot;obserever moments&quot; have - but I don't think 
<br />
they are novel length.  I imagine them more like sentences (a complete thought as my English teacher 
<br />
used to say), and sentences *don't* have enough information to allow them to be reconstructed into 
<br />
the novel they came from.
<br />
<br />That's why I suggest that OMs are not an adequate ontological basis for a world model.  On the other 
<br />
hand, if we include brain processes, or more abstractly, subconscious thoughts, then we would have 
<br />
enough information to string them together.
<br />
<br />Brent Meeker
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The carriages of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; train, on the other hand, not only have to be the right sort of physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures, they also have to be specially linked in order to make up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the train. You might argue that as a matter of technical necessity, the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moments in an individual stream of consciousness can only be generated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by the activity of a single human brain, but that would just be like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying that only a particular author would have the technical ability to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write a particular series of novels. It's tempting to think that within 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cranium there is a special glue connecting our thoughts together so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that they seem to belong to the one person, but, as Laplace said about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God, there is no need for such a hypothesis.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt;If I split into two that presents no problem for the 3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; person POV (there are two instantiations of Stathis extant where before there was one) nor for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; the 1st person POV (each instantiation knows it is experiencing what it is experiencing as it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; experiencing it). A problem does arise when I anticipate the split (which one will I become?) or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; look back at the split (*I* was the original!); there is no correct answer in these cases because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; it is based on 3rd person extrapolation of the 1st person POV, which in addition to its other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; failings assumes only a single entity can be extant at any one time (only a single 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; exists by definition, but multiple 3rd persons can exist at the one time). This is not to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; that my mind can or should overcome [Lee Corbin disagrees on the &quot;should&quot;] the deeply ingrained
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; belief or illusion that I am a unique, one-track individual living my life from start to finish,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's only an illusion if you assume the &quot;observer moment&quot; model is reality.  In a sense all models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are &quot;illusions&quot;, but some are better than others and at any given time we might as well tentatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; take our best model as a representation of reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't mean anything by &quot;observer moment&quot; beyond the fact that a stream 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of consciousness can be divided up into moments of arbitrary length. 
</em><br />
<br />Arbitrary?...a lifetime?  Do you mean they a like intervals of time?  That's not how understood 
<br />
their usage in the past.  If they don't have some atomic character then it doesn't make much sense 
<br />
to talk about them existing separately and being strung together.  Instants in a time interval form 
<br />
a series by virtue of topological inclusion in neighborhoods.  That was Bertrand Russell's analysis 
<br />
of psychological time - each OM overlapped it's predecessor and successor.
