Hall Finney: ''You might want to clarify what you mean by quantum suicide
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;working&quot;.  What do you hope to accomplish via QS?  What effect will it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have on your subjective perceptions?''
</em><br />
<br />By ''quantum suicide working'' I mean that you could make the probability of
<br />
winning the lottery as close to 100% as you like, by building better and
<br />
better suicide machines. I think that quantum suicide does not work. Simply,
<br />
because the probability distribution of the states I can find myself in is a
<br />
fixed quantity. The continuous time evolution without memory loss I
<br />
(normally)experience is not a fundamental propery of the laws of nature.
<br />
Rather this follows from the conservation of probability and applies only
<br />
when the person himself in also ''conserved''. In other cases, e.g. suicide
<br />
experiments,  this breaks down. If you have a 99.9% of dying, then I would
<br />
say that you would have to assign a probability of 99.9% to experiencing
<br />
other branches inconsistent with the one you are in now. of course, this
<br />
means that you won't have any recollection of performing the experiment. The
<br />
99.9% is distributed according to the fixed probability distribution of the
<br />
states I can find myself in. To me this is the only possible consistent
<br />
picture of the plenitude.

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think we all agree with the objective consequences of QS.  Someone kills
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themself in some branch of the multiverse.  They are removed from that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; branch but continue to live on in others.  The disagreements begin when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we consider the subjective effects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The most limited view, I think, is that QS will subjectively fail.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, if you attempt to kill yourself in some clean way, the machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will work in some universes and fail in others, but you will only notice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the result in those universes (or branches of the MWI) where it fails.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In single-universe models, we would predict that a highly reliable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; QS machine will simply terminate your existence.  You won't perceive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything, after it goes off.  In multiverse models, a QS believer would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predict that you will continue to exist even after the machine goes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; off.  Your measure will be reduced, but your existence will continue.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the most limited and restricted prediction with regard to QS in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a multiverse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (With some assumptions, you could get the same prediction of continued
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence in a single-universe model.  If we assume that the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is infinite in extent so there are multiple copies of you, or that some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future civilization will simulate your mind perfectly, then this could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a mechanism for your existence to continue subjectively even after the QS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine goes off.  But in a finite and &quot;small&quot; single-universe model with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; limited future computing capacity, then a QS death is final and complete.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A more ambitious version of QS attempts to change and hopefully improve
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your circumstances by pruning those branches where bad things happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By doing this, your total measure is reduced, but your average happiness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (averaged over all instances of yourself) is increased.  Because your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total measure is reduced, your total happiness is decreased (unless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you only use QS to eliminate branches where your happiness is negative,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is, where you are better off dead).  So there is a tradeoff between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increasing your average happiness while decreasing your total happiness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe it is a matter of personal preference which one is better, so I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; think on this basis that QS is right for some people and wrong for others.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another ambitious flavor of QS predicts that we can distinguish multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from single-universe realities by attempting QS.  It is even possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that all versions of death fail just like QS would, hence that everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who has ever lived has experienced subjective immortality, if multiverse
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories are true.  By this reasoning, each person will eventually become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjectively convinced of multiverse theories (if they deduce that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the explanation for their bizarrely extended lifespans).
