<br />
&quot;Every creation&quot; hypotheses, instead of every computation 
<br />
or every mathematical structure.
<br />
I favor a variant of the everything idea, which I would like 
<br />
to call the &quot;every creation&quot; approach. In some sense it 
<br />
creates every &quot;computational moment&quot;. Computations are 
<br />
not required as fundamental entities. Almost all you need is 
<br />
a natural definition to make new creations from pairs of 
<br />
creations. This determines the evolution of an avalanche of 
<br />
creations. Creations inside the avalanche may be aware only 
<br />
of those creations to which they are in relative equilibrium. 
<br />
As with other approaches, a consequence seems to be the 
<br />
emergence of the laws of Physics.
<br />
<br />Let me start with the following 4 hypotheses:
<br />
<br />1. There is an underlying time. 
<br />
2. There are creations (creation objects).
<br />
3. There is a natural creation operation defined, which 
<br />
creates new creations from existing creations.
<br />
4. Every natural creation operation happens.
<br />
<br />Some more words on these hypotheses:
<br />
<br />(1) There is an underlying time, which is discrete. This 
<br />
makes it easy to talk about creation operations, as if they 
<br />
happened in our time. I will do this.
<br />
<br />(2a) New creations can be made (created). 
<br />
(2b) Creations do not get deleted. 
<br />
(2c) Creations can be made in multiple copies. Creations 
<br />
have multiplicities. Whether a creation can be made does 
<br />
not depend on (can not be prevented by) the preexistence 
<br />
of an identical creation. 
<br />
<br />(3) For any two creations x and y, there is a natural 
<br />
creation operation [x,y] defined, which makes a creation z. 
<br />
Lets call x the operator, and y the operand. I do not specify 
<br />
the definition of the natural creation operation here. I have 
<br />
given one of my favorite definitions, using replacement 
<br />
operators, in a previous posting, where [(x1 x2),y] creates 
<br />
a copy of y and replaces every occurrence of x1 by x2.
<br />
<br />(4a) Every-creation hypotheses. The natural creation 
<br />
operation [x,y] is happening for every existing creation x 
<br />
and for every existing creation y.
<br />
<br />(4b) Every existing creation x has equal chance to become 
<br />
the operator in [x,y].
<br />
<br />(4c) Every existing creation y has equal chance to become 
<br />
the operand in [x,y].
<br />
<br />Let's also make the assumption that creations are (directly) 
<br />
responsible for our awareness and our perceptions of the 
<br />
world. What are the consequences of such a hypotheses?
<br />
<br />Creations may perceive other creations only indirectly and 
<br />
only if the later possibly play a role in the creations' 
<br />
histories. We may not perceive properties which depend 
<br />
on the underlying time Tau. But we may be able to perceive 
<br />
invariant properties, which do not change when the 
<br />
underlying time Tau is getting larger and larger. We can be 
<br />
indirectly aware of creations who's multiplicities are on 
<br />
average in relative equilibrium with the multiplicities of the 
<br />
creations which are directly responsible for our 
<br />
awareness.  
<br />
<br />Thus the observable universe consists, possibly only, of 
<br />
creations who's multiplicities grow on average at the same 
<br />
rate.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Multiplicity(creation,Tau) = phi(creation) * growth_factor(Tau) 
<br />
&nbsp;Multiplicity (observer,Tau) = phi(observer) * growth_factor(Tau)
<br />
<br />The relative multiplicity, 
<br />
&nbsp;Multiplicity (creation,Tau) /Multiplicity (observer,Tau) = 
<br />
&nbsp;= phi(creation) / phi(observer),
<br />
is independent of Tau.
<br />
<br />For creations inside the avalanche, the importance of 
<br />
the initial conditions depends on the number of possible 
<br />
equilibrium states (or the number of certain equivalence 
<br />
classes of possible equilibrium states.) If there is only one 
<br />
possible equilibrium state, then the initial conditions are 
<br />
not relevant at all.
<br />
<br />Let's assume that Tau is large enough, so that the 
<br />
equilibrium is reached for the creations under 
<br />
consideration. The growth factor can be calculated when 
<br />
we make the simplifying approximation that every operation 
<br />
[x,y] just creates one new copy of y. In that case trivially all 
<br />
creations are in equilibrium, as required. If one of the 
<br />
operations [x,y] does not create a new copy of y, but 
<br />
instead another creation z, the equilibrium is broken. There 
<br />
is one creation y missing and one creation z too much. This 
<br />
is as if the creation y had been moved from y to z. The 
<br />
effective movement can be compensated by an effective 
<br />
movement back. There could be another operation [x2,z] 
<br />
which creates a creation y. Adding loops of effective 
<br />
movements does not change the equilibrium.
<br />
<br />May a set X of creations x_i form a pattern, and the 
<br />
operations among these creations may produce another 
<br />
pattern Y of creations y_i. Lets call this an effective particle 
<br />
P moving from X to Y. The broken equilibrium can be 
<br />
restored by an effective particle moving from Y to X. Let 
<br />
me call this the effective antiparticle P_bar moving into the 
<br />
opposite direction as particle P is moving.
<br />
<br />The choice of naming is intended to remind you of the 
<br />
Feynman-Stückelberg interpretation of E&lt;0 Solutions of 
<br />
equations like Dirac or Klein-Gordon Equation:
<br />
Negative-energy particle solutions going backward in time 
<br />
*describe*, 
<br />
positive-energy antiparticle solutions going forward in time.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
In short, this interpretation claims that
<br />
&nbsp;P(-E) *describes* P_bar(E). 
<br />
But the equilibrium argument claims that
<br />
&nbsp;the existence of P *requires the existence* of P_bar, 
<br />
P_bar also moving into the opposite direction. 
<br />
<br />This suggest a new(?) interpretation of the equations 
<br />
where the two possible solutions are not only two ways of 
<br />
describing reality. They correspond to two parts of reality. 
<br />
They are based on two processes, which require each 
<br />
other in order to keep the equilibrium. For every particle 
<br />
with energy E there is an antiparticle with energy -E, and 
<br />
the total energy is E = 0.
<br />
<br />In a Feynman graph, there are lines that, according to 
<br />
Feynman, do correspond to a particle, *or* do correspond to 
<br />
an antiparticle moving into the opposite direction. However, 
<br />
according to the equilibrium argument, the line should be 
<br />
interpreted as a loop(s) composed of a particle, moving in 
<br />
one direction, *and* an antiparticle, moving backwards in 
<br />
time, back to the original space-time point.
<br />
<br />Feynman, with his lines, draws kind of one-dimensional 
<br />
projections of such loops. The additional dimension, which 
<br />
is not visible in his graphs, corresponds to transformations 
<br />
between spaces, which you may call &quot;invention space&quot; and 
<br />
&quot;feedback space&quot;, or covariant and contravariant space. 
<br />
This additional degree of freedom may be what is needed 
<br />
to explain the additional imaginary component of quantum 
<br />
mechanical amplitudes -- to explain them from multiplicities, 
<br />
which are given as natural numbers.
<br />
<br />Covariant and Contravariant Spaces are not two 
<br />
descriptions of one reality which can be transformed into 
<br />
each other. They are rather two parts of reality which 
<br />
require each other in order to keep the equilibrium growth 
<br />
intact.
<br />
<br />Does the Hilbert space corresponds to that part of the 
<br />
creation space which is already in equilibrium?
<br />
<br />The following ideas may rely on the definition of the natural 
<br />
creation operation.  
<br />
<br />Einstein's field equation might be understood as equations 
<br />
stating that effects of all loops going through one creation, 
<br />
such as all gravitation loops and all loops from energetic 
<br />
pattern movements, cancel each other and have no effect 
<br />
on that particular creation, except for its equilibrium growth.
<br />
<br />What is gravitation? Creations lead to new creations by 
<br />
the continuing inflation, plus continuing shrinking, plus 
<br />
rotations, and other transformations of space-time, at any 
<br />
space-time point in the remembered history of those 
<br />
creations. This gives a kind of diffusion effect, which could 
<br />
be responsible for gravitation. Do today's gravitation fields 
<br />
evolve according to the dynamics of &quot;the past&quot;, in particular 
<br />
the dynamics of the Big Bang? 
<br />
<br />By the way, at the moment I favor space-time generator 
<br />
&quot;definitions&quot; which result in non-projectable dimensions. 
<br />
(Projections can not be done easily with few operations.) 
<br />
The projections to the border which I have mentioned in a 
<br />
previous posting may correspond to other degrees of 
<br />
freedom though.
