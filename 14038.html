<br />
In part one I argued against ASSA. Here I first summarize my
<br />
argument against UD, then against the general possibility of any single
<br />
objective measure.
<br />
<br />1. There is an infinite number of universal Turing machines, so there
<br />
is an infinite number of UD. If we want to use one UD as an objective
<br />
measure, there has to be a universal Turing machine that is somehow uniquely
<br />
suitable for this purpose. Why that UTM and not some other? We don't even 
<br />
know what that justification might look like.
<br />
<br />2. Computation is just a small subset of math. I knew this was the case,
<br />
having learned about oracle machines in my theory of computation class. But
<br />
I didn't realize just how small a subset until I read _Theory of Recursive
<br />
Functions and Effective Computability_, by Hartley Rogers. Given that there
<br />
is so much mathematical structure outside of computation, why should they
<br />
not exist? How can we be *sure* that they don't exist? If we are not *sure*,
<br />
then we have to take the possibility of their existence into account when
<br />
making decisions, in which case we still need a measure in which they have
<br />
non-zero measures.
<br />
<br />3. At this point I started looking for another measure that can replace UD.
<br />
I came up with what I called &quot;set theoretic universal measure&quot;, where the
<br />
measure of a set is inversely related to the length of its description in a
<br />
formal set theory. Set theory covers a lot more math, but otherwise we still
<br />
have the same problems. Which formal set theory do we use? And how can we be
<br />
sure that all structures that can possibly exist possible can be formalized
<br />
as sets? (An example of something that can't would be a device that can
<br />
decide the truth value of any set theoretic statement.)
<br />
<br />4. Besides the lack of good candidates, the demise of ASSA means we don't
<br />
need an objective measure anymore. There is no longer an issue of sampling,
<br />
so we don't need an objective measure to sample from. The thought experiment
<br />
in part 1 of &quot;against UD+ASSA&quot; points out that in general, it's not the
<br />
measure of one's observer-moment that matters, but the measures of the
<br />
outcomes that are causally related to one's decisions. Those measures
<br />
can be interpreted as indications of how much one cares about the outcomes,
<br />
and therefore can be subjective.
<br />
<br />So where does this chain of thought lead us? I think UD+ASSA, while flawed, 
<br />
can serve as a kind of stepping stone towards a more general rationality. 
<br />
Somehow UD+ASSA is more intuitively appealing, whereas truly generalized 
<br />
rationality looks very alien to us. I'm not sure any of us can really 
<br />
practice the latter, even if we can accept it philosophically. But perhaps 
<br />
our descendents
<br />
can. One danger I see with UD+ASSA is we'll program it into an AI, and the
<br />
AI will be forever stuck with the idea that non-computable phenomenon can't 
<br />
exist,
<br />
no matter what evidence it might observe.
