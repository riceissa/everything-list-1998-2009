</em><br />
<br />Indeed, Chalmers' double-aspect theory of information seemed like a
<br />
good starting point when I first read it 18 months or so ago, but I
<br />
guess the question is where do you go from there?  Chalmers did a
<br />
great job of articulating the mind-body problem, and I think in
<br />
defending his initial position, but he doesn't seem to have made much
<br />
progress in the 14 or so years since then.  BUT, then...I guess that's
<br />
the &quot;hard&quot; part for you.
<br />
<br />Though, just in the last month, I think I've kind of shifted gears
<br />
here.  Why should consciousness be an aspect of information (or
<br />
anything else)?  Why not consider information an aspect of
<br />
consciousness?
<br />
<br />In an earlier thread, Brent mentioned Hume, and in response you
<br />
referenced Kant, BUT I'm not very familiar with either.  But just in
<br />
the last week I've discovered that Kant has already given some thought
<br />
to this topic, and kindly summarized his views in &quot;A Critique of Pure
<br />
Reason&quot;!  Who knew???  So now I'm interested in reading up on Kant,
<br />
and particularly G. E. Schulze's subsequent response in Aenesidemus.
<br />
SO...if you've already been down this path, then I'd be interested to
<br />
hear your thoughts.
<br />
<br />Though, obviously since A Critique of Pure reason was written in 1781,
<br />
and yet we're still here discussing it almost 230 years later, it
<br />
didn't offer any conclusive answers...but still...
<br />
<br />Of course even before Hume and Kant, we have Leibniz in Monadology (1714):
<br />
<br />&quot;Moreover, it must be confessed that perception and that which depends
<br />
upon it are inexplicable on mechanical grounds, that is to say, by
<br />
means of figures and motions. And supposing there were a machine, so
<br />
constructed as to think, feel, and have perception, it might be
<br />
conceived as increased in size, while keeping the same proportions, so
<br />
that one might go into it as into a mill. That being so, we should, on
<br />
examining its interior, find only parts which work one upon another,
<br />
and never anything by which to explain a perception.  Thus it is in a
<br />
simple substance, and not in a compound or in a machine, that
<br />
perception must be sought for.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />BUT, I think my general criticism is that we seem to be mistaking
<br />
descriptions of what we are conscious of, with an explanation of
<br />
consciousness itself.
<br />
<br />So, for instance, if Bruno is correct in his mathematical theory of
<br />
the origins of consciousness...what does that mean, really?
<br />
Ultimately, how is it different than saying &quot;consciousness exists
<br />
uncaused, but by pure chance there are these interesting patterns that
<br />
can be seen in this record of our past observations.&quot;
<br />
<br />So Brent made the assertion that &quot;The ability to predict is an
<br />
excellent measure of understanding.&quot;  But if your predictions are all
<br />
*caused* by the same system that you are making predictions about, and
<br />
that same system is also then *causing* your judgments about the
<br />
accuracy of the predictions, then I don't think that his assertion is
<br />
necessarily true.
<br />
<br />You could not have understood other than you did, you could not have
<br />
predicted other than you did, and you could not have judged the
<br />
accuracy of the prediction other than you did.  There was no freedom
<br />
in any of these things.  In effect...there was no understanding, there
<br />
was no prediction, and there was no judgement...it was all just the
<br />
system going through it's motions, which for some reason resulted in
<br />
an epiphenomenal EXPERIENCE of understanding, prediction, and
<br />
judgement.
<br />
<br />And I think that this was part of the discussion between Kant,
<br />
Reinhold, Schulze, et al.
<br />
<br />For example:
<br />
<br />&quot;As determined by the Critique of Pure Reason, the function of the
<br />
principle of causality thus undercuts all philosophizing about the
<br />
where or how of the origin of our cognitions. All assertions on the
<br />
matter, and every conclusion drawn from them, become empty subtleties,
<br />
for once we accept that determination of the principle as our rule of
<br />
thought, we could never ask, 'Does anything actually exist which is
<br />
the ground and cause of our representations?'. We can only ask, 'How
<br />
must the understanding join these representations together, in keeping
<br />
with the pre-determined functions of its activity, in order to gather
<br />
them as one experience?'&quot;  -- Gottlob Ernst Schulze
<br />
<br />SO...I dunno.  Bruno made the dreaded accusation of solipsism, but I'm
<br />
not sure how you avoid ending up there (at least in the
<br />
epistemological sense of there being a limit to what can be known),
<br />
regardless of which direction you go.  You can take the long way, or
<br />
you can take the short way, but all roads do seem to ultimately lead
<br />
to some variety of solipsism.  The only question is what kind of
<br />
scenery will you get along the way.  Hmmmm.
