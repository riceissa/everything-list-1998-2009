(maybe) just 'a bit ' off topic, but interesting......
<br />
<br />Jorge Liuis Borges: &quot;Las Ruinas Circulares&quot; [circa 1941]
<br />
<a href="http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/00/pwillen1/lit/cruins.htm">http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/00/pwillen1/lit/cruins.htm</a>

<br />
<br />No one saw him disembark in the unanimous night, no one saw
<br />
the bamboo canoe sink into the sacred mud, but in a few days
<br />
there was no one who did not know that the taciturn man came
<br />
from the South and that his home had been one of those
<br />
numberless villages upstream in the deeply cleft side of the mountain,
<br />
where the Zend language has not been contaminated by
<br />
Greek and where leprosy is infrequent. What is certain is that
<br />
the grey man kissed the mud, climbed up the bank with pushing
<br />
aside (probably, without feeling) the blades which were lacerating
<br />
his flesh, and crawled, nauseated and bloodstained, up to
<br />
the circular enclosure crowned with a stone tiger or horse,
<br />
which sometimes was the color of flame and now was that of ashes.
<br />
This circle was a temple which had been devoured by ancient fires,
<br />
profaned by the miasmal jungle, and whose god no longer received
<br />
the homage of men. The stranger stretched himself out beneath
<br />
the pedestal. He was awakened by the sun high overhead.
<br />
He was not astonished to find that his wounds had healed;
<br />
he closed his pallid eyes and slept, not through weakness of flesh
<br />
but through determination of will. He knew that this temple was
<br />
the place required for his invincible intent; he knew that the incessant
<br />
trees had not succeeded in strangling the ruins of another propitious
<br />
temple downstream which had once belonged to gods now burned
<br />
and dead; he knew that his immediate obligation was to dream.
<br />
Toward midnight he was awakened by the inconsolable shriek of a bird.
<br />
Tracks of bare feet, some figs and a jug warned him that the men of the
<br />
region had been spying respectfully on his sleep, soliciting his protection
<br />
or afraid of his magic. He felt a chill of fear, and sought out a sepulchral
<br />
niche in the dilapidated wall where he concealed himself among unfamiliar
<br />
leaves.
<br />
<br />The purpose which guided him was not impossible, though supernatural.
<br />
He wanted to dream a man; he wanted to dream him in minute entirety
<br />
and impose him on reality. This magic project had exhausted the entire
<br />
expanse of his mind; if someone had asked him his name or to relate some
<br />
event of his former life, he would not have been able to give an answer. This
<br />
uninhabited, ruined temple suited him, for it is contained a minimum of visible
<br />
world; the proximity of the workmen also suited him, for they took it upon
<br />
themselves to provide for his frugal needs. The rice and fruit they brought him
<br />
were nourishment enough for his body, which was consecrated to the sole task
<br />
of sleeping and dreaming.
<br />
<br />At first, his dreams were chaotic; then in a short while they became dialectic
<br />
in nature. The stranger dreamed that he was in the center of a circular
<br />
amphitheater which was more or less the burnt temple; clouds of taciturn students
<br />
filled the tiers of seats; the faces of the farthest ones hung at a distance of many
<br />
centuries and as high as the stars, but their features were completely precise.
<br />
The man lectured his pupils on anatomy, cosmography, and magic: the faces
<br />
listened anxiously and tried to answer understandingly, as if they guessed
<br />
the importance of that examination which would redeem one of them from his
<br />
condition of empty illusion and interpolate him into the real world.
<br />
Asleep or awake, the man thought over the answers of his phantoms,
<br />
did not allow himself to be deceived by imposters, and in certain perplexities
<br />
he sensed a growing intelligence. He was seeking a soul worthy of participating
<br />
in the universe.
<br />
<br />After nine or ten nights he understood with a certain bitterness that he could
<br />
expect nothing from those pupils who accepted his doctrine passively, but
<br />
that he could expect something from those who occasionally dared to oppose him.
<br />
The former group, although worthy of love and affection, could not ascend to the
<br />
level of individuals; the latter pre-existed to a slightly greater degree. One afternoon
<br />
(now afternoons were also given over to sleep, now he was only awake for a couple
<br />
hours at daybreak) he dismissed the vast illusory student body for good and kept
<br />
only one pupil. He was a taciturn, sallow boy, at times intractable, and whose sharp
<br />
features resembled of those of his dreamer. The brusque elimination of his fellow
<br />
students did not disconcert him for long; after a few private lessons, his progress
<br />
was enough to astound the teacher. Nevertheless, a catastrophe took place.
<br />
One day, the man emerged from his sleep as if from a viscous desert, looked at the
<br />
useless afternoon light which he immediately confused with the dawn,
<br />
and understood that he had not dreamed. All that night and all day long, the intolerable
<br />
lucidity of insomnia fell upon him. He tried exploring the forest, to lose his strength;
<br />
among the hemlock he barely succeeded in experiencing several short snatchs
<br />
of sleep, veined with fleeting, rudimentary visions that were useless. He tried to
<br />
assemble the student body but scarcely had he articulated a few brief words of
<br />
exhortation when it became deformed and was then erased. In his almost perpetual
<br />
vigil, tears of anger burned his old eyes.
<br />
<br />He understood that modeling the incoherent and vertiginous matter of which 
<br />
dreams are composed was the most difficult task that a man could undertake, 
<br />
even though he should penetrate all the enigmas of a superior and inferior order; 
<br />
much more difficult than weaving a rope out of sand or coining the faceless wind. 
<br />
He swore he would forget the enormous hallucination which had thrown him off 
<br />
at first, and he sought another method of work. Before putting it into execution, 
<br />
he spent a month recovering his strength, which had been squandered by his 
<br />
delirium. He abandoned all premeditation of dreaming and almost immediately 
<br />
succeeded in sleeping a reasonable part of each day. The few times that he had 
<br />
dreams during this period, he paid no attention to them. Before resuming his task, 
<br />
he waited until the moon's disk was perfect. Then, in the afternoon, he purified 
<br />
himself in the waters of the river, worshiped the planetary gods, pronounced the 
<br />
prescribed syllables of a mighty name, and went to sleep. He dreamed almost 
<br />
immediately, with his heart throbbing.
<br />
<br />He dreamed that it was warm, secret, about the size of a clenched fist, 
<br />
and of a garnet color within the penumbra of a human body as yet without 
<br />
face or sex; during fourteen lucid nights he dreampt of it with meticulous love. 
<br />
Every night he perceived it more clearly. He did not touch it; he only permitted 
<br />
himself to witness it, to observe it, and occasionally to rectify it with a glance. 
<br />
He perceived it and lived it from all angles and distances. On the fourteenth night 
<br />
he lightly touched the pulmonary artery with his index finger, then the whole heart, 
<br />
outside and inside. He was satisfied with the examination. He deliberately did not 
<br />
dream for a night; he took up the heart again, invoked the name of a planet, and
<br />
undertook the vision of another of the principle organs. Within a year he had come 
<br />
to the skeleton and the eyelids. The innumerable hair was perhaps the most 
<br />
difficult task. He dreamed an entire man--a young man, but who did not sit up or talk,
<br />
who was unable to open his eyes. Night after night, the man dreamt him asleep.
<br />
<br />In the Gnostic cosmosgonies, demiurges fashion a red Adam who cannot stand; 
<br />
as a clumsy, crude and elemental as this Adam of dust was the Adam of dreams 
<br />
forged by the wizard's nights. One afternoon, the man almost destroyed his entire 
<br />
work, but then changed his mind. (It would have been better had he destroyed it.) 
<br />
When he had exhausted all supplications to the deities of earth, he threw himself at 
<br />
the feet of the effigy which was perhaps a tiger or perhaps a colt and implored its 
<br />
unknown help. That evening, at twilight, he dreamt of the statue. He dreamt it was 
<br />
alive, tremulous: it was not an atrocious bastard of a tiger and a colt, but at the 
<br />
same time these two firey creatures and also a bull, a rose, and a storm. 
<br />
This multiple god revealed to him that his earthly name was Fire, and that in this 
<br />
circular temple (and in others like it) people had once made sacrifices to him and 
<br />
worshiped him, and that he would magically animate the dreamed phantom, in such 
<br />
a way that all creatures, except Fire itself and the dreamer, would believe to be a 
<br />
man of flesh and blood. He commanded that once this man had been instructed 
<br />
in all the rites, he should be sent to the other ruined temple whose pyramids 
<br />
were still standing downstream, so that some voice would glorify him in that deserted 
<br />
ediface. In the dream of the man that dreamed, the dreamed one awoke.
<br />
<br />The wizard carried out the orders he had been given. He devoted a certain length 
<br />
of time (which finally proved to be two years) to instructing him in the mysteries of 
<br />
the universe and the cult of fire. Secretly, he was pained at the idea of being seperated 
<br />
from him. On the pretext of pedagogical necessity, each day he increased the number 
<br />
of hours dedicated to dreaming. He also remade the right shoulder, which was 
<br />
somewhat defective. At times, he was disturbed by the impression that all this had 
<br />
already happened . . . In general, his days were happy; when he closed his eyes, 
<br />
he thought: Now I will be with my son. Or, more rarely: The son I have engendered 
<br />
is waiting for me and will not exist if I do not go to him.
<br />
<br />Gradually, he began accustoming him to reality. Once he ordered him to place 
<br />
a flag on a faraway peak. The next day the flag was fluttering on the peak. 
<br />
He tried other analogous experiments, each time more audacious. With a certain 
<br />
bitterness, he understood that his son was ready to be born--and perhaps impatient. 
<br />
That night he kissed him for the first time and sent him off to the other temple whose 
<br />
remains were turning white downstream, across many miles of inextricable jungle and
<br />
marshes. Before doing this (and so that his son should never know that he was a 
<br />
phantom, so that he should think himself a man like any other) he destroyed in him 
<br />
all memory of his years of apprenticeship.
<br />
<br />His victory and peace became blurred with boredom. In the twilight times of dusk 
<br />
and dawn, he would prostrate himself before the stone figure, perhaps imagining 
<br />
his unreal son carrying out identical rites in other circular ruins downstream; at night
<br />
he no longer dreamed, or dreamed as any man does. His perceptions of the sounds 
<br />
and forms of the universe became somewhat pallid: his absent son was being 
<br />
nourished by these diminution of his soul. The purpose of his life had been fulfilled; 
<br />
the man remained in a kind of ecstasy. After a certain time, which some chronicles 
<br />
prefer to compute in years and others in decades, two oarsmen awoke him at midnight; 
<br />
he could not see their faces, but they spoke to him of a charmed man in a temple
<br />
of the North, capable of walking on fire without burning himself. The wizard suddenly 
<br />
remembered the words of the god. He remembered that of all the creatures that people 
<br />
the earth, Fire was the only one who knew his son to be a phantom. This memory, 
<br />
which at first calmed him, ended by tormenting him. He feared lest his son should 
<br />
meditate on this abnormal privilege and by some means find out he was a mere 
<br />
simulacrum. Not to be a man, to be a projection of another man's dreams--what an 
<br />
incomparable humiliation, what madness! Any father is interested in the sons he has 
<br />
procreated (or permitted) out of the mere confusion of happiness; it was natural that 
<br />
the wizard should fear for the future of that son whom he had thought out entrail by 
<br />
entrail, feature by feature, in a thousand and one secret nights.
<br />
<br />His misgivings ended abruptly, but not without certain forewarnings. First (after 
<br />
a long drought) a remote cloud, as light as a bird, appeared on a hill; then, toward 
<br />
the South, the sky took on the rose color of leopard's gums; then came clouds of
<br />
smoke which rusted the metal of the nights; afterwards came the panic-stricken 
<br />
flight of wild animals. For what had happened many centuries before was repeating 
<br />
itself. The ruins of the sanctuary of the god of Fire was destroyed by fire. In a dawn
<br />
without birds, the wizard saw the concentric fire licking the walls. For a moment, 
<br />
he thought of taking refuge in the water, but then he understood that death was 
<br />
coming to crown his old age and absolve him from his labors. He walked toward the
<br />
sheets of flame. They did not bite his flesh, they caressed him and flooded him 
<br />
without heat or combustion. With relief, with humiliation, with terror, he understood 
<br />
that he also was an illusion, that someone else was dreaming him.
