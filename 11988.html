<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This discussion is a hybrid of a number of very famous thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiments. Unlike those thought experiments, however, this experiment is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aimed purely and only at scientists. The intent is to demonstrate clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and definitively the nature of subjective experience (phenomenal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness) and its primal role in a scientist's ability to function as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a scientist.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine a room. Its walls and celing and floor are matt black. There are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no doors or windows. All over the walls are digital displays which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; announce numbers in warm, friendly colours. Up against all four walls and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up to international standard control desk height (roughly 750mm) is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sloping console. Covering the console around all four walls  are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pushbuttons. The number of displays is equal to the number of sensory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nerves entering a typical human brain from the peripheral nervous systems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including all sensory input. The number of pushbuttons is equal to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entire set of effector nerves emanating from a typical brain. This total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of displays and pushbuttons is in the millions.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a comfortable chair upon which is seated the room's sole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occupant, Marvin the human. Marvin is normal except for never having been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside the room and having never otherwise acquired any knowledge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything other than that of the room and its contents. He knows absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing of any sort of external world or any other people. He has no clue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about the external world except for what he can surmise from the displays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and buttons.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin, like all healthy humans, has an experiential life which is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collection of private phenomenal scenes delivered by his brain material.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These are operating normally except that Marvin has been deprived of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the phenomenal content (experiences) that he ever could have received had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he been allowed outside the room. He has had a lifetime of experiences,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but all of them have been confined to depicting the room.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin is a scientist. He studies the science of not-room. His life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consists of experiments which involve the pressing of buttons and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording of patterns in the displays. Over time an enormous volume of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data begins to show patterns for which Marvin constructs models. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models are generalisations of the behaviour of the displays after buttons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are pushed in a certain way. He tests and refines the models and has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developed a form of symbolic representation of the behaviour of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; displays. Certain features on the display occur regularly enough that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; names have been given to notional not-room phenomena. One is called the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tronelec. The mathematics of not-room includes a lot of rules about the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour of tronelecs. In time Marvin realises that his exploration of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not-room can be done according to routine rules and he sets about a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; systematic, exhaustive assay of the entire range of possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; button/display relationships.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everything is going nicely but then one day a well known pattern does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occur the way it used to. After a while the old pattern resumes. The whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics of not-room is undermined. It takes a long time for Marvin to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct a new model that accounts for the novel behaviour. A new entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; called gytravi is needed. Then things settle down and routine systematic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploration resumes.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In time a massive collection of not-room entities and behavioural rules is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; constructed and begins to repeat itself. So much so that Marvin, after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; checking and rechecking, finds that the model seems to have stabilised.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; At this point we stop to survey the situation.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The first thing to note is that the room is an empirically verified
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physiologically accurate representation of the sensory circumstances of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human brain. Nervous activity effect/affect is replicated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; buttons/displays and all signals are standardised. There are no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiential qualities (perceptual sensation qualities) associated with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this nervous activity. This is a physiologically verified, well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; established empirical fact. Indeed the room is a little too kind - If you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discarded all the buttons and displays, then that is a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physiologically accurate circumstance .
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main point is that this collection of totally sensationless signals is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exactly what is available to a human brain and through which all sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measurement arrives.  Consider the room without a Marvin in it. Based on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what evidence is there any reason to even conceptualise the existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an external world?
</em><br />
<br />There is nothing in the room to conceptualise an
<br />
external world because Marvin does all the conceptualising.
<br />
Is this supposed to show that an you need phenomenality is
<br />
needed to conceptualise an external world? It doesn't.
<br />
We could imagine the control panel delivering non-phenomenal
<br />
information to Marvin (such as he slips of paper used in the Chinese
<br />
Room).
<br />
Or we could split Marvin into two people, A Watcher who has the
<br />
phenomena,
<br />
and a Theorist that the watcher reports to non-phenomenally. IOW,
<br />
<br />The philosophical zombie is an exercise in conceivability.
<br />
We can conceive of a version of your Room in which the interpretation
<br />
(i.e. the basis for supposing that there is an external world)
<br />
is separated from the phenomenality. We can still conceive of a version
<br />
in which all the functionality is separate from all the phenomenality.
<br />
<br />It might be the case that the conceivability is not your concern,
<br />
your concern is real possibility. But then you are no
<br />
contradicting anything the philosophers are saying. And real
<br />
possibility is not established by armchair thought experiments.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Nothing in that room gives any indication of it.
</em><br />
<br />That depends on what you mean by &quot;indication&quot;. The Room contains
<br />
all the information a real human has to go on, by hypothesis.
<br />
There isn't a single light that goes on to say &quot;Hey! There is an
<br />
external world!&quot;. But Marvin seems to be able to process his data
<br />
on the assumption that they are caused by some stable formation
<br />
like a gytravi or a tronelec. Perhaps Marvin needs a apriori
<br />
belief ore assumption that there is an external world, in order
<br />
to proceed with an investigation of the signals &quot;as if&quot; they had
<br />
external sources. There is no reason Marvin should
<br />
lack such an assumption, there is no reason a real person should,
<br />
there is no reason a zombie should lack it, and no reason
<br />
a suitably programmed AI should.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is no a-priori knowledge of not-room.
</em><br />
<br />So you say. But is that scientifically accurate? The tabula
<br />
rasa theory is rather out of date. And there is no reason
<br />
a zombie or anything else should lack such knowledge, since
<br />
it is not a phenomenon. And why would Marvin need *knowledge*
<br />
anyway? Isn't an assumption or hypothesis enough?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No possible way to interpret any of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the signals. All there is is correlated behaviour - the behaviour of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; displays correlated with other displays and buttons, none of which have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any other discernable impact.
</em><br />
<br />If you say that Marvin is the Theorist, the Interpreter,
<br />
and you unplug him, there is no interpretation. Does that mean
<br />
that interpretation and phenomena are all done by the same module
<br />
in humans? I don't see any evidence for that, it all
<br />
depends on your say-so. In any case, it doesn't
<br />
affect conceivability arguments. It is still
<br />
conceivable that phenomenology and functionality could be prized apart.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The room is quintessentially a zombie in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense it has no experiential life at all despite being wired as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; extravagently as a complete human.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin thinks of himself as a scientist. Exactly what is he a scientist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of? His science is, he thinks, the science of 'not-room'.
</em><br />
<br />Why would that be? You said the Room+Marvin system is supposed
<br />
to be an accurate representation of a person. Well, unless the person
<br />
is a solipsist, the Room+Marvin sytem would believe in an external
<br />
world.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  But is it? All
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he has is a very sophisticated model of display/button correlations.
</em><br />
<br />So you say. According to you he has a &quot;flat&quot;, or instrumental model
<br />
that doesn't posit anything behind the phenomenal instrument-readings.
<br />
But it is far from clear why tha must be the case. Since real-world
<br />
scientists don't *have* to be instrumentalists, why should inner
<br />
homunculi like
<br />
Marvin? (More below [*])
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; His
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science is not about 'not-room' at all! His science is the science of room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; display/buttons. He has absolutely no justification to any claim about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything going on anywhere else, although that is how Marvin thinks of it.
</em><br />
<br />A predictive model is justification for whatever entities it posits.
<br />
Your claim of &quot;absolutely no justification&quot; is not itself justified.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; His science is very very predictive of button/display behaviour. As to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality of the model he has developed? He has no way of contextualising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any of the abstractions he has created with the actual state of affairs in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'not-room'.
</em><br />
<br />What does *that* mean? You mean can't step outside the room-world
<br />
system,
<br />
hover above them, and compare them directly. No he doesn't know in that
<br />
sense. But if that is a problem
<br />
(and I don't think it is, not as much as is claimed) it is a problem
<br />
that affects everything. You cannot claim there is a magical solution,
<br />
if that is
<br />
what you are claiming. And it is an exaggeration that Marvin does not
<br />
know
<br />
at all because he lacks &quot;transcendent realism&quot;. He still has
<br />
&quot;empirical;
<br />
realism&quot;. He can construct robust, predictive models.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Absolutely anything could be out there driving the displays and Marvin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will never know.
</em><br />
<br />Since Marvin can reject theories as over complex (Occam's razor) or
<br />
falsify the predictively, &quot;absolutely anything&quot; is unwarranted.
<br />
<br />But he still has limitations. If he has observed that phenomenon X is
<br />
followed
<br />
by phenomenon Y, he can suppose that there is an external
<br />
process characterised by the tendency to cause those phenomena.
<br />
But he doesn't know what that &quot;thing&quot; might be in itself.
<br />
<br />He is no in a state of absolute ignorance, of total
<br />
knowledge. He has good-enough knowledge about certain things.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Indeed worse than that, there may be an infinite number
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of different ways that not-room could present the same display values and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marvin would never know. The display data is fundamentally, intrinsically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambiguous.
</em><br />
<br />If the external world has in-itself properties then it is  undetermined
<br />
by Marvin's knowledge. If it is completely characterised by
<br />
the tendency to cause phenomena in onlookers, it isn't. You have
<br />
to make an assumption about the metaphysical nature of the world
<br />
to come to a conclusion about how ignorant we are (or Marvin is) about
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Even if the displays and buttons were nicely grouped and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; labeled all that would happen is that there would be expectations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related behaviours in a group, which Marvin does not have to name himself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It could even be named 'sight', 'sound' and so on and Marvin may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand what that might mean, but it delivers no claim to any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definitive or unambiguous knowledge of not-room.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And that, fundamentally, is the real nub of the matter.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is outside the room? It doesn't really matter. It could be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborate multistory building with a ratsnest of electrical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interconnections done with a computer. It could be a control room in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; head of a giant robot. It could be literally wired up to a human body with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no brain. It could be a spaceship. None of that matters except in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; details. Marvin can never know because he has no experience available to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even imagine it.
</em><br />
<br />Marvin can exclude a lot of possibilities with Occam's' razor and
<br />
falsification.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; To finish off the room scenario we now take Marvin out of the room. In his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place we leave a machine that is based on his systematic scientific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour. It runs with clockwork and pneumatics from punched cards. None
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the displays are needed, none of the buttons are needed - they are all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly connected to the new machine. The massively complex model Marvin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has constructed, which has nothing whatever to do with 'not-room' except
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the most indirect of abstracted ways,
</em><br />
<br />i.e. accept inasmuch as it *does* have something to do with the
<br />
not-room...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  goes on being verified and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occasionally amended using more rules for amending the model, also devised
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by Marvin.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The model can never say anything about any changes in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'not-room'. All it can sense is novel (unexpected according to the model)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviour in the sensing displays, which is an entirely different thing.
</em><br />
<br />Not at all. If the model start with the assumption that the
<br />
phenomenal displays are driven by some sort of external world, and
<br />
there is no
<br />
reason why it shouldn't, then the most
<br />
obvious explanation for a change in the behaviour of the phenomena
<br />
is a change in the world. A rule-driven, self-modifying model is just
<br />
as capable of formulating hypotheses about what external-world
<br />
entity could be causing its phenomena as a scientist.
<br />
<br />(or course if it isn't self-modifying, it is a bit stuck. By why
<br />
make that assumption? It has nothing to do with
<br />
phemomena. Self-modification, is functionality, not phenomenality)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main message to take from this is that this bizarre concoction is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary circumstance that would exist in a human if it weren't for what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomenal consciousness provides a human scientist.
</em><br />
<br />You haven't demonstrated anything of the kind. The conclusion that
<br />
&quot;Marvin&quot; plays a vital role is just produced ready-made
<br />
at the end. It is not justified.
