<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing.
</em><br />
<br />I would suggest that the multiverse concept is better thought of in
<br />
somewhat different terms.  It's goal is not really to explain where the
<br />
universe comes from.  (In fact, that question does not even make sense
<br />
to me.)
<br />
<br />Rather, what it explains better than many other theories is why the
<br />
universe looks the way it does.  Why is the universe like THIS rather
<br />
than like THAT?  Why are the physical constants what they are?  Why are
<br />
there three dimensions rather than two or four?  These are hard questions
<br />
for any physical theory.
<br />
<br />Multiverse theories generally sidestep these issues by proposing that
<br />
all universes exist.  Then they explain why we see what we do by invoking
<br />
anthropic reasoning, that we would only see universes that are conducive
<br />
to life.
<br />
<br />Does this really &quot;not explain anything&quot;?  I would say that it explains
<br />
that there are things that don't need to be explained.  Or at least,
<br />
they should be explained in very different terms.  It is hard to say
<br />
why the universe &quot;must&quot; be three dimensional.  What is it about other
<br />
dimensionalities that would make them impossible?  That doesn't make
<br />
sense.  But Tegmark shows reasons why even if universes with other
<br />
dimensionalities exist, they are unlikely to have life.  The physics
<br />
just isn't as conducive to living things as in our universe.
<br />
<br />That's a very different kind of argument than you get with a single
<br />
universe model.  Anthropic reasoning is only explanatory if you assume the
<br />
actual existence of an ensemble of universes, as multiverse models do.
<br />
The multiverse therefore elevates anthropic reasoning from something of
<br />
a tautology, a form of circular reasoning, up to an actual explanatory
<br />
principle that has real value in helping us understand why the world is
<br />
as we see it.
<br />
<br />In time, I hope we will see complexity theory elevated in a similar way,
<br />
as Russell Standish discusses in his Why Occam's Razor paper.  Ideally we
<br />
will be able to get evidence some day that the physical laws of our own
<br />
universe are about as simple as you can have and still expect life to
<br />
form and evolve.  In conjunction with acceptance of generalized Occam's
<br />
Razor, we will have a very good explanation of the universe we see.
