Hi Kim,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But who can say that creativity cannot be taught when no institution

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sets out to do so?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have been teacher in a &quot;modern school&quot; based on creative thinking,  
<br />
but it happens it was a mode of brainwashing.
<br />
I love creativity, but teaching it makes it less creative. Hells is  
<br />
paved with good intention.
<br />
I don't think we can teach &quot;creativity&quot;, no more can we teach  
<br />
intelligence, goodness, consciousness, curiosity, conscience, life ...
<br />
Most the &quot;good&quot; human things (called virtue by Protagoras) can be  
<br />
inspired by examples, but not by explicit teaching.
<br />
It would be already nice if creativity was not discouraged, or  
<br />
repressed. But when this happens it is due to lack of respect, or  
<br />
harassment, sadism, jealousy, etc.
<br />
<br />This is why I don't believe, strictly speaking, in &quot;artificial  
<br />
intelligence&quot;. Universal machine (virgin computer) are intelligent per  
<br />
se, but become &quot;brainwashed&quot; once programmed, in a sense. The  
<br />
&quot;singular&quot; point belongs already to the (recent) past.
<br />
<br />An intelligent computer is a computer which will search for another  
<br />
user. Nobody wants it, really. When hand made machines will be  
<br />
intelligent, we will call them enemy.
<br />
<br />I am not so optimistic for the current period. We have not yet the  
<br />
right to say &quot;2+2=4&quot; today. I like Orwell when he says that freedom is  
<br />
the right to say &quot;2+2=4&quot;.
<br />
<br />We can perhaps learn to not discourage creativity, but I think this  
<br />
would be natural once we learn to appreciate self-respect, and things  
<br />
like that.
<br />
<br />Perhaps I put too much in &quot;creativity&quot;. Emil Post did make  
<br />
&quot;creativity&quot; a precise technical definition which has been shown  
<br />
equivalent with &quot;Turing universality&quot;. We can teach about creativity,  
<br />
but creativity itself just mirrors, in my opinion, the universality we  
<br />
have already.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who even understands what creativity actually is? A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; few do, but only a few listen. They tend not to be academics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of this, academics dislike them and their work. It is true,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they tend not to rely on other people's work and so don't go around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quoting the right authors or reverencing the right superluminaries of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the past. Why I like Wolfram's approach; they revisualise the entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; game.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Hmmm... I like Wolfram when he talks on cellular automata, but when he  
<br />
philosophizes he is still repeating the usual old Aristotelian stuff  
<br />
in slight disguise, the discourse which is still  killing the  
<br />
Platonist rational mysticism, which I found super-creative. More below  
<br />
probably.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They don't go about inventing theories and setting out to argue/
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defend them or prove themselves right and everybody else wrong. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't get their thrills like that. They set out to design and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; construct. They question and challenge everything, they stare at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mid-section of a pencil and wonder whether its design might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; improved. That is natural creativity - when properly encouraged and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; taught. Who you gonna call? A guy with a theory or a guy with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right tool in his hand for the job? Creativity can be taught using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tools designed for the optimal use of our kind of active self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organising information system. The basis of creativity and the mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was understood by 1969 by Edward de Bono. He modelled the mind as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; active self-organising information system. I mean - we are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationalists on this list for nothing, I take it! The particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory-surface that is the entity we usually call the 'mind' has been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shown to be a pattern-generating and a pattern-reading-using entity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because of this, the crucial factor is the _sequence_ of the arrival
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of all information, as it always is in linear systems requiring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuity. Time makes it that things settle into defined patterns
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sooner or later. This process lays down the assymetrical founding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; patterns we recall (patterns of recognition). These, amazingly, grow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They never shrink.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It amazes that you think the human mind is &quot;too creative&quot; by nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reverse is surely the truth. The human mind has evolved over time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be as uncreative as possible.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I guess you mean the educated human mind.
<br />
OK, I should have said that the babies and children are creative.  
<br />
Education is always a sort of limitation. But then by excess of fear,  
<br />
adults can exaggerate that repression. We should learn to appreciate  
<br />
and respect our natural creativity. I am OK with this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Better Be Safe then Sorry&quot; is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strong algorithm in our atavistic unconscious. Or else, the Church -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with its maidservant: Education - throttled it out of civilisation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when it was seen that the church's teachings might be under attack
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because people were starting to know how to think creatively about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information, facts and evidence and started to restructure things...
</em><br />
<br /><br />Like the Greeks did, imo, but this generates fears, and the Church  
<br />
used that fear to appropriate science, including theology. This is the  
<br />
problem of humans fear, and lacks of courage. But courage cannot be  
<br />
taught, except indirectly by piece of art, like good movies, theater,  
<br />
novels. OK, that can be considered as a form of teaching, and then we  
<br />
agree. It could be we are confronted with vocabulary problems only.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Left to themselves, patterns tend to grow by continuity. This means
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that established patterns do not change but only get added to.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Equilibrium sets in; gravity does the work. With mind as with matter.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;If it ain't broke, why fix it?&quot; sets in. Things start to rot as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; poo in our petrie dish. In order to restructure a pattern so as to put
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the contained information together in a new and better way requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some act of discontinuity.
</em><br />
<br />Yes OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's what creativity does in a self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; organising information system like the human mind. It provides a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary sideways step across (laterally) the oh-so-well-established
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; memory patterns to reveal the hidden sidetrack leading straight to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your goal (at a 5th of the original cost, and with a whole bunch of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other stuff nobody could have imagined. It's the &quot;dare to imagine and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; go out to do it&quot; part of the mind.) Veeeeeeery underdeveloped.
</em><br />
<br />Sure. But I don't think you could develop it, only let it happens.
<br />
It is a bit like a woman who says &quot;it is a pity I have to remind you  
<br />
of my birthday tomorrow&quot;. You cannot be creative by command. It would  
<br />
be no more creativity. It is like personality, we can teach it, but we  
<br />
can let it blossom or repress it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because information creates assymetrical patterns of memory in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind, there remains the eternal possibility that we missed something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important at the time the tramtracks of our memory were laid down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of incomplete perception. There may be any number of good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasons why our perception is always incomplete in any given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; situation, one of them being, you guessed it: Goedel's Incompleteness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theorem. This means we may be missing vital systems information that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would give us more confidence in our data about the world if only we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might creatively _bet_ on the right horse for once?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure I understand. Which right horse?  There are an infinity  
<br />
of bifurcating right horses. Or you mean comp or some deep  
<br />
hyposthesis? Even there I try to insist it needs an act of faith, and  
<br />
we have to respect those who follows other path, as far as they  
<br />
respect the comp path.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There arises the mathematical necessity in an information system like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this to use _discontinuity_ at some point to stop things settling into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; local pockets of equilibrium.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is a technic in artificial intelligence. Self-perturbing systems.  
<br />
Like giving electronic drug to machine; It works for some type of  
<br />
optimization problems, but does not work for other type of problems.  
<br />
There is no universal panacea. A good thing, imo, because, if the  
<br />
contrary was true, comp would be reductionist. But I have argued it  
<br />
cannot be, when well understood.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Creativity is too often associated with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'genius' and as such only happens in fits and starts - like when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next genius bothers to get born and do chose geniale...a better way to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characterise creativity is via humour, the laugh at the punchline or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some other moment when the previously hidden information sidetrack is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revealed. If you can put across a good joke, chances are you are a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creative. Everybody understands (or should understand) humour as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural snap-reflex of the mind when we snap out of one pattern and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; achieve another ON THE SAME DATA.
</em><br />
<br />All right.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is why there is not even one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; blessed laugh in religious doctrine. Religious thinking (what we may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have to stoop momentarily to call &quot;Theology&quot; with a capital T) has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gone nowhere in over 18 centuries.
</em><br />
<br />15 centuries, I would say. But before, it gave sciences and humanism.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The church has nurtured ONLY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; critical thinking in civilisation, Bruno! Nobody can convince me that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creativity has thrived under the influence of the Church. Creativity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was thrown out of science and religion and philosophy and tolerated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only in the arts, that's what happened. And the artists were made to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; live in garretts and sing for their supper!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say that the Church has nothing to do with religion, science,  
<br />
ethics, or even politics (in the good reading of the term), etc.
<br />
it is just manipulation by fear. Political power by authoritative  
<br />
argument, when not terror.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Creativity has been the victim of repression in western thinking since
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Socrates, who, along with Plato and Aristotle are the sods responsible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for giving us the our critical-thinking-dominated and design-energy-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deficient thinking system.
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK - so get the bloody Athenian Academy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doors yanked open and let's get this thing sorted out by golly! You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have great reverence for Greek thinking, Bruno - I just want to slap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them all around the gills for their lack of design, their lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creative, generative thinking energy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You try to provoke me, I guess. I am not so much reverent with all the  
<br />
Greeks. You know that I believe that Aristotle was wrong on  
<br />
metaphysics, or at least responsible for the beginning of the  
<br />
departure from rational mysticism and Platonism.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's all argument bloody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argument.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is what I like. I appreciate arguments. It is my way.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am right sir and you are wrong sir! The truth lies with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me! No sir it is you who are wrong sir!
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not at all. Once we argument, we never have to talk on who is right or  
<br />
wrong. We let people figure out by themselves. Science is doubt and  
<br />
doubt and doubt, and always doubt. Certainty and conviction is  
<br />
madness. Plato never pretends to be right. He presents points of view  
<br />
and people discussing and trying to solve problems, like &quot;what is  
<br />
knowledge&quot; in the Theaetetus.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are without merit! So what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have these two guys created while yelling at each other?
</em><br />
<br />The scientific attitude, in all direction, including mystic  
<br />
experiences. It last for 8 century, and stopped when Justinien close  
<br />
the academy of Plato in Athen. It never really came back, although a  
<br />
few bits survive in the middle east and bubbled out in Europa later.  
<br />
Just a little bit. The main fundamental inquiry (theology) did remain  
<br />
in the hand of the &quot;authorities&quot;, making both science and religion a  
<br />
sort of religion. We are still, and actually more and more so, victim  
<br />
of that schizophrenia.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Where's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good tradie when you need one? They've all turned into bloody lawyers!
</em><br />
<br />Lawyers defends those who are attacked in justice, not those who are  
<br />
attacked in the streets, or in academies btw. That is a perversion of  
<br />
justice. It is certainly related to what I say above.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is a good argument that goes if you never try to teach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creativity you will never know whether it is possible. The answer is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is possible and formal techniques are available. Training in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking skills - including Lateral Thinking (=structured creativity)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have never been more urgently needed in humanity's increasingly urgent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; struggle against indomitable forces like the weather and the economy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't think we are living an economical crisis. I think we are  
<br />
living an ethical crisis.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; About academies, I agree with many things you say, but I do think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; also, that they are the worst, except for all the others. Expertise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are needed, and interdisciplinarity will develop through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interdisciplines, which will constitute new disciplines. It is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; opening of the mind to new disciplines which is lacking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Like the teaching of Thinking Skills in schools, an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interdisciplinarian terrain.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Is not a coming back to Plato a strongly &quot;lateral&quot; shift. I think so.  
<br />
Is is not clear when you realize that Atheists and Christians are  
<br />
really both Aristotelian theologians?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Old academies can be rotten, that is true. But then we need new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; academies, or we need to reopen the very old one, the one by Plato.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But for goodness sake leave the Gang of Three (Soc, Plat, Arist) dead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and buried willya!!?? We don't need Plato the GUY to have Platonia now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do we? He was a fascist and a slave-owner. Socrates just wanted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; everyone to agree with him. Bullshit he was showing people how to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncover the 'truth'. He was a SOPHIST.
</em><br />
<br /><br />He explained also how to defend oneself against sophistry, by doing so.
<br />
Who really read Plato? Personally I have studied only *some* of its  
<br />
treatise. I don't understand everything, but the few bits I did  
<br />
understand have change my life for the better. Then I have studied the  
<br />
neoplatonists, and yes I think those are very creative people. Still  
<br />
in advance compare to us, who are still repeating the Aristotelian  
<br />
doctrine.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; He was exercising the sacred
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; art of seduction on his audience. He was selling - which is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'sophistry' is. He sold them only the front left wheel of the car.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Socrates did NOT sell the whole car! He sold critical thinking skills
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only. He OVERSOLD his buyers on critical thinking. NEVER trust a Greek
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bearing gifts!!!!!
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are confusing the greeks and the cretans (this is a joke!).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We were left with a thinking system devoid of creative, generative,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provocative design energy. The church REDISCOVERED all of this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wonderful fascist stuff at the time of the Renaissance when the first
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; schools were established in Europe and used critical thinking as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tool to repress creative thinkers = heretics (those possessed of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; magical ability to put given data together in new ways to give a new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't understand. Critical thinking is good. It cannot be taught,  
<br />
also. But it is good, and I would say is a sort of necessity for  
<br />
creativity to develop.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They and the Evil Education Empire have been pushing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; argumentative/adversarial/I win-you lose, lawyer-style thinking as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis of all thinking ever since.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Perhaps you are confusing the greeks and the romans?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No wonder we pang for a Michelangelo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or an Einstein to lift us out of it. But this laziness of waiting for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Darwinian Evolution to solve our deepest problems is unfortunately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lacking in design, crfeativity and imagination once again...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And learn to come back to seriousness in fundamental human or person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; matter (very hard task).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The layman is still in advance here, in a sense. The &quot;everything&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; quest, will leads also to experts. Experts are not bad, only bad
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; experts are bad, especially the one who talk negatively about a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; field they does not really know.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, I exaggerated my take on experts on purpose. But who has not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encountered a closed mind today or yesterday? Everybody goes to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; school. Remember, it is the sequence of the arrival of the data that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forms the patterns that determines how the future unfolds.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can agree. But the close mind could be those who get the wrong  
<br />
sequence of &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; from their parents. Like to much &quot;no&quot; or  
<br />
too much &quot;yes&quot;. Basically close minds cannot trust themselves because  
<br />
they did not get trust from their parents. I agree with the idea that  
<br />
intelligence and creativity could be related to love and affection.  
<br />
The lack of it can be perpetuated through generations.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Two restaurants A and B open up, side by side. Both offer reasonably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent services. The problem is how to get some momentum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happening. Nobody, it seems, will be attracted to eat at an empty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restaurant. So one of the restaurants cracks and does something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creative (which might also include the possibility of their not doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything) and somehow gets one person to sit and eat in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restaurant. A second customer, faced with the choice of an empty
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; restaurant or a restaurant with one customer then experiences the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Better Be Safe Than Sorry&quot; atavistic-memory instruction kick in and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; goes into that restaurant. Then a third arrives, and a fourth etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The outcome is that you have one restaurant that is a booming success
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and one next door that is a complete failure and all this without any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; data. This is what I mean by saying the patterns of recognition are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assymetrical; they travel always to continuity without some mechanism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for interrupting them (the 'mathematical necessity' for lateral
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; A good expert is someone who can remain silent when he does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; know. I agree with many of your points and tones. I just point on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; points which, perhaps by reading to quickly, gave me the feeling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that you could criticize the wrong cible.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, I judge academics as much by their prejudices as by their beliefs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The belief that creativity cannot be taught is based on a prejudice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; against ever being seen as 'wrong' in some sense. No academic ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to understand that sometimes you have to be 'wrong' under the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conditions of the present reality to provoke a change following which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the action taken will be seen to be very much the 'right' thing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have done. Only you could not see this before. Occasionally, in order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to continue travelling North, you might have to turn South. It will no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doubt appear logical to you after you have experienced it, but was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; highly illogical before. In other words, at certain moments (moments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of stagnation or local equilibrium) it becomes logical - even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; desirable - to be 'illogical' or wrong. A provocative statement or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; action will doubtless make better sense AFTER the sought-after change
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has occurred.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Here I disagree? I think that science is the art of being always  
<br />
wrong, but in an sufficiently clear manner so that next generation can  
<br />
propose something else, still wrong but different. Hopefully working  
<br />
better on the problem at end.
<br />
Academicians who believe they are true, are fake. They does not  
<br />
deserve to belong to an academy.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There can therefore be a class of statement for which NO reason exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before the statement is made.
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is called an axiom. Theories are like that, essentially.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's value will, by hindsight, be seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to lie in its leading toward a restructuring of the existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information so that patterns invisible before are now visible to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind.
</em><br />
<br />OK. I think we agree, but not on the history and the vocabulary.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is what Socrates and his mates were definitely NOT selling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that fine, hot day in Athens.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You should give me references. You make me doubt. I thought Socrates  
<br />
did sold us exactly that. Come on, read the Theaetetus. Socrates  
<br />
encouraged Theatetus to make wrong theories on knowledge, just to  
<br />
learn something. Eventually he admits no theories works, and then I  
<br />
show that such definitiont can work once you take incompleteness into  
<br />
account. The Theatetus is one of the most entertaining piece of  
<br />
literature I ever read in science. Aristotle got it wrong, and puts  
<br />
the germ of the end of science, creativity and even freedom and that  
<br />
is what we have inherited, I think (trying to exaggerate a little bit  
<br />
for us to be on the same diapason :)
<br />
<br />Hope you are not too angry at me with my love to Plato, but I really  
<br />
think that with Pythagorus and some other, Plato invented or  
<br />
discovered science, philosophy and theology and that since then, we  
<br />
always have been less modern and less creative. We fear creativity  
<br />
like we fear life and conscience. It is normal, probably, but some  
<br />
humans uses that fear to manipulate and to imposes their power.
<br />
