<br />Phew!  This will help with what follows, I hope.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, perhaps OK, unless by field you assume geometry at the start.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Geometry like physics is secondary with comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could perhaps elaborate of what you mean by field.
</em><br />
<br />In this case by 'field' I simply mean a self-asserting (i.e.
<br />
primitive) subjective ground (in my view equating to the least we can
<br />
say about existence per se) conceived as logically prior to any
<br />
differentiation.  Thereafter we and all phenomena (including geometry)
<br />
emerge by some self-motivated action of symmetry breaking (e.g.
<br />
vibrating strings, COMP?).  Field may well be the wrong word.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Careful: comp cannot equate consciousness and computation. It can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;equate&quot; consciousness with higher order emergent modality (emergent on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a continuum of computations).
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree, in the sense of 'reflexive self-consciousness'. I meant
<br />
rather that no consciousness of whatever sort can be associated with
<br />
purely 'computational' processes within a 'physical computer', as
<br />
opposed to those actions that emerge 'organically' from self-acting
<br />
processes of symmetry breaking.  In my scheme, the sense-action that
<br />
we experience as conscious subjects (and that of everything else we
<br />
observe) must inherit its awareness ('sense') and its causal power
<br />
('action') directly from fundamental self-sensing and self-acting
<br />
symmetry-breaking.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The reason is that computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'causation' depends on the introjection of 'rules' from a context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; external to the computed 'world',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see why.
</em><br />
<br />My use of the term 'self' here is intended (Occamishly) to halt
<br />
explanatory regression, and this is why we must not rely on superadded
<br />
'rules' coming from 'outside the system' (if so, we must go 'further
<br />
out' to incorporate them). 'Computation', in the sense of the
<br />
programmed action of a 'physical computer', exists only at a
<br />
metaphorical level, one that we *impute* to the behaviour of a system,
<br />
rather than one which emerges from its intrinsic sense-action.  In
<br />
this sense, the 'rules of programmed behaviour' are introjected from
<br />
our mental context, which is *external* to the computer itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and hence loses contact both with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intrinsic causal self-motivation and the fundamental linkage of felt-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sense and action.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are quick here ...
</em><br />
<br />Have I slowed down at all? What I'm saying is that as layers of
<br />
phenomena emerge self-actingly and self-sensingly (self-graspingly?),
<br />
a distinction must always be made between what is an 'organic'
<br />
emergent - which can be the basis for quasi-independent sensing and
<br />
acting, inherited directly from the fundamental level - and what is an
<br />
imputed or metaphorical narrative - meaning it exists merely as a
<br />
model *within* an organic emergent. In that sense it has 'lost
<br />
contact' with the direct sense-action from which all higher-level
<br />
sensing and action emerge.  All the content of our consciousness
<br />
exists in the form of such narratives, models or metaphors - my
<br />
*model* of 'Bruno' doesn't have independent consciousness *as such*.
<br />
Likewise, a 'program' (whether intended by a programmer, or imputed to
<br />
random activity) is merely a mental introject imposed *by us* on
<br />
organic action whose intrinsic felt-sense is independent of this
<br />
interpretation.
<br />
<br />If you'll bear with me, Bruno, it may be possible to reconcile my
<br />
scheme with AR+COMP.  The 'realism' of AR posits that everything real
<br />
(necessarily including the subjectively real) emerges from what is
<br />
axiomatically intrinsic to AR.  ISTM then that the self-sensing, self-
<br />
acting process of differentiation or symmetry-breaking looks like the
<br />
detailed working-out of AR's 'active potential' through COMP.  I
<br />
really feel that much of this is an implicit aspect of your scheme,
<br />
because, by analogy with my argument above, AR+COMP *must* be
<br />
(Occamishly) self-sensing, self-acting and self-justifying so that we
<br />
who are posited to emerge from it can inherit precisely those
<br />
characteristics. Else, we would have nothing left but a perversely
<br />
incoherent appeal to something 'external' to this universe of
<br />
explanation.
<br />
<br />If one uses 'computation' in the sense merely of the behaviour of a
<br />
'physical' computer (already a higher-level emergent in either
<br />
scheme), then purely metaphorical interpretations of its behaviour do
<br />
indeed 'lose contact', as I argue above, with its organically
<br />
inherited self-sense-action.  But if by 'computation' we mean the
<br />
fundamental emergence of phenomena by AR+COMP, then in such a scheme
<br />
we retain the ability to track self-sense-action through layers of
<br />
emergence.  We can also differentiate those narratives which 'exist'
<br />
metaphorically as mental models and hence could never account for real
<br />
states of existence-consciousness.  C++ classes or zombies both being
<br />
cases in point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; After Godel, Lob, .... I do think that comp is the best we can hope to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;save&quot; the notion of consciousness, free will, responsibility, qualia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (first)-persons, and many notions like that.  Tthe &quot;only&quot; price: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of matter looses is fundamental character, and we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain matter without postulating it as usual ...). We have to come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back (assuming comp) to Plato, or better Plotinus, Proclus, ...
</em><br />
<br />Are we any closer to agreement, mutatis terminoligical mutandis?  My
<br />
scheme does not take 'matter' to be fundamental, but rather an
<br />
emergent (with 'mind') from something prior that possesses the
<br />
characteristics of self-assertion, self-sensing, and self-action.  I
<br />
posit these because they are what is (Occamishly) required to save the
<br />
appearances.  If we take AR to be that which is self-asserting, with
<br />
its intrinsic (arithmetical) set of symmetry-breaking axioms, then
<br />
COMP perhaps can stand for the process that drives this potential
<br />
towards emergent layers of self-action and self-sensing.  It then
<br />
becomes an empirical programme whether AR+COMP possesses the synthetic
<br />
power to save all the necessary phenomena.  As you would wish it, I
<br />
imagine.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Since my name has popped up I'll stop lurking and come clean!  I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; been thinking about this again since reading Galen Strawson's recent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; defence of 'panpsychism' in &quot;Consciousness and its place in Nature&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; His view is that any 'emergent' phenomenon must supervene on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental properties of the same type - e.g. 'liquidity' is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; characteristic behaviour of a fluid that simply supervenes on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; objective characteristics of its constituent molecules, which in turn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; supervenes on quantum-level phenomena and so on down to superstrings
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or whatever.  But there is no analogous narrative in which it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; correspondingly obvious that 1st-person *experience* should ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'emerge' from any objective or 3rd-person description, in his view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Also in mine.  Reviewing some of my earlier posts on this subject, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would now say that my view is that our 1st-person experience is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; privileged direct evidence (i.e. the *only* direct evidence we have)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that we, and all phenomena of which we are aware, emerge through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiation of a subjective existential field. Such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiation may be termed 'sense-action', because it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simultaneously the self-sensing relationships of (what Strawson terms)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'ultimates' (e.g. vibrational strings) that emerge through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiation, and the source of all action and structure.  We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; abstract our notion of 'physical law' from the inter-relations of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ultimates, but it is crucial that we do not concretise such 'law' as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some real superadded influence introjected from 'outside' the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; existential field.  Rather, we take the field for what it is, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; accept that it feels and does as we find it.  This is simply wielding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Occam's razor with precision to prevent an infinite regress of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'explanation'. Ultimately, to preserve the appearances, existence must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; necessarily be self-actualising , self-motivating, and self-sensing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By rooting sense-action in the ultimates, we can now embed our own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intuitive sensing and motivation firmly where it needs to be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ultimate reality.  Fundamentally, we do what we do for (something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like) the reasons we believe, and we feel what we feel because that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (something like) how reality ultimately feels about it.  Our actions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emerge from ultimate action, and our sensing emerges from ultimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sensing.  This is crucial for questions of 'free will' and suffering
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (which I do not put in scare quotes).  Our 'will' is a complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emergent of ultimate will-to-action, and our painful experiences are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; directly inherited from underlying layers of sense-action that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; simultaneously motivate our consequential actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; By contrast, the 'non-conscious' zombie is existentially and causally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; disconnected - as postulated, it is abstracted from sense-action; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cannot see, hear, or feel and hence cannot enact (except in *our*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; imagination).  No self-sensing = no relationship = no action.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; poor creature is a free-standing 'physical abstraction' - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; uninhabited husk of a self-actualised subject.  It's the notion you're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; left with when you posit an 'externalised world' (i.e. a model) in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; pure intellectual abstraction from concrete self-actualisation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Up to here comp basically agree (modulo misunderstanding of my part,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sure).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I mean that what you say is not just consistent with comp (which is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a lot after Godel: even inconsistency is consistent with comp!) but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably near truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; With comp neither matter nor mind can be taken as primitive or primary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My approach proposes something like a fundamental subjective field as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'primitive' (in an Occamish way).  Such a field is not yet mind nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; matter, but both 'mind' and 'matter' emerge from it through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; differentiation, with characteristics that supervene naturally on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; those proposed as primitive.  That is: its fundamental action is self-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; motivated and self-sensing, and consequently all complex emergents are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experienced as self-motivated and self-sensing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, perhaps OK, unless by field you assume geometry at the start.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Geometry like physics is secondary with comp).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You could perhaps elaborate of what you mean by field.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If valid, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; approach is a knock-down argument against the equation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness with computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Careful: comp cannot equate consciousness and computation. It can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;equate&quot; consciousness with higher order emergent modality (emergent on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a continuum of computations).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The reason is that computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'causation' depends on the introjection of 'rules' from a context
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; external to the computed 'world',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see why.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and hence loses contact both with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; intrinsic causal self-motivation and the fundamental linkage of felt-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sense and action.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are quick here ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Hence any felt-sense a computer may possess as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; concrete object must necessarily be independent of whatever purely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; programmed 'actions' it may be instantiating.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do agree here. It fits comp ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Also, the notion of,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; say, a rock implementing any computation, and hence potentially any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; attached consciousness, is likewise struck down by the lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; coordination between ultimate sense-action and the notional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computational content.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, but this remains to be verified with comp. Indeed it is part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of what makes comp testable empirically.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I've written the above fairly quickly and it's probably not very well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; expressed, but if anyone's interested I'd be happy to debate and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; enlarge.  But it expresses why I think Torgny's position is absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; untenable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We do agree on that (although with comp Torgny's position is, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first person solipsism, quasi undecidable).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If he were 'unconscious' as he claims he would be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; zombie, and hence, abstracted from the reality of sense-action, he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would exist only in our imaginations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see your point and tend to agree. BTW, note that the Bohm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intepretation of QM is full of zombie of that kind. Without comp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sorry, but I would much less agree with you on this point.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;save&quot; the notion of consciousness, free will, responsibility, qualia,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (first)-persons, and many notions like that.  Tthe &quot;only&quot; price: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notion of matter looses is fundamental character, and we have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain matter without postulating it as usual ...). We have to come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; back (assuming comp) to Plato, or better Plotinus, Proclus, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I realize that few people really swallow Godel, Lob ... and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical logic (except mathematical logicians). I guess that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps the real difficulty here.
