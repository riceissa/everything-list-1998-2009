<br />
In the interests of doing wild speculation here, which some folks are 
<br />
asking for more of, here's a followup to a discussion we had a few 
<br />
weeks ago:
<br />
<br />The Fermi Paradox asks the question: &quot;If extraterrestrial civilizations 
<br />
are at all common, even at the level of a few dozen per galaxy per 
<br />
galaxy life, why aren't they _here_? Or why don't we see artifacts, 
<br />
relics, ringworlds, Dyson spheres, evidence of large engineering 
<br />
projects, and so on?&quot; Fermi used the succinct quip, &quot;Why aren't they 
<br />
here?,&quot; with the details about rate of spread even at slow, sublight 
<br />
speeds, etc. implicitly obvious.
<br />
<br />The Many Fermis Paradox is a variant of this: &quot;If the MWI theory is 
<br />
correct, AND if there is any communication or movement between the 
<br />
worlds that is possible, why aren't they here?&quot;
<br />
<br />(Note that movement amongst branches is not part of any conventional 
<br />
MWI interpretations, though it's used in novels and in some of the 
<br />
wilder interpretations.)
<br />
<br />Hal Finney pointed out that the same kind of Fermi Paradox argument is 
<br />
used to argue against time travel: &quot;If time travel is possible, why 
<br />
aren't travelers from the future here?&quot; (Arguments that they are here 
<br />
but they only talk to some people, etc., are trumped by the sheer size 
<br />
of the future, and by the &quot;defector&quot; argument to the &quot;Cosmic 
<br />
Quarrantine&quot; solution to the Fermi Paradox: _lots_ of defectors would 
<br />
violate the quarantine, etc.
<br />
<br />Hal further raised the possibility that, like the time travel version, 
<br />
perhaps the resolution has to do with the need for a &quot;receiver&quot;: 
<br />
neither time travelers nor MWI travelers are here, yet, because we have 
<br />
not, yet, built the portals or receivers needed by them (opening  up 
<br />
wormholes, a la Visser, etc.).
<br />
<br />(The other resolution being, of course, that neither time travel nor 
<br />
MWI travel is possible, which was Fermi's point about the absence of 
<br />
aliens.)
<br />
<br />I've thought about Hal's point and have this reply:
<br />
<br />While we on this earth may not have built the necessary portals or 
<br />
receivers for either (time travel or MWI travel), some other 
<br />
civilization surely would have a billion or three billion years ago. 
<br />
(Assuming the usual crude estimates of distribution of ages of stars, 
<br />
non-special status of us as observers (a la Boostrum and others), and 
<br />
crude estimates of likelihood of advanced civilizations elsewhere. If 
<br />
we are the only form of life in our timelike region of the universe, 
<br />
i.e., within a few billion light-years, then of course this makes the 
<br />
odds of another receiver-builder nil.
<br />
<br />In this fanciful scenario, the Throgians in a small elliptical galaxy 
<br />
in Coma Berenices built a MWI receiver in their approximate equivalent 
<br />
of 4500 A.D., by our measures. This was 2 billion years ago. Once this 
<br />
MWI receiver was built, the Throgians were the beneficiaries and 
<br />
traders of vast amounts of MWI knowledge...every discovery made in any 
<br />
MWI universe they had contact with, including universes filled with 
<br />
other civilizations, all manner of creatures, and so on.
<br />
<br />Call this first construction of such a portal the &quot;MWI Singularity.&quot;
<br />
<br />(A similar situation, arguably much the same situation, ensues with the 
<br />
construction of the first time machine portal.)
<br />
<br />Steven Baxter has written a series of novels in his future history 
<br />
which explore this very kind of idea.
<br />
<br />With nearly any nonzero chance of building either a time machine or MWI 
<br />
receiver, a distribution of civilizations would have done this billions 
<br />
of years ago. (By the usual argument that there is nothing which makes 
<br />
our emergence about 4.5 billion years after the formation/cooling of 
<br />
the earth anything special in the cosmic scheme: there should have been 
<br />
planets which similarly formed and cooled as many as 12 billion years 
<br />
ago, giving some of them a 6-8 billion year &quot;head start&quot; on us.)
<br />
<br /><br />As with other Singularities (AI, nanotech, time travel, MWI) in a 
<br />
cosmos with civilizations with these kinds of head starts, &quot;why aren't 
<br />
they here?&quot;
<br />
<br />Perhaps in the MWI Singularity, the number of other universes expands 
<br />
more rapidly than the number of occupants, making the movement of 
<br />
travelers into any one branch not interesting. (Why would they come 
<br />
here to our particular branch when endless diversity lies out there in 
<br />
the multiverse? This was explored by John Barnes in &quot;Finities,&quot; where 
<br />
our branch &quot;empties out&quot; after MWI travel is discovered. Or they 
<br />
evacuate a la Bear's &quot;Blood Music.&quot; Or they do things we cannot 
<br />
imagine.)
<br />
<br />Perhaps there are other types of &quot;cosmic censorship&quot; involved.
<br />
<br />But an issue we must face is this: if the MWI worlds--or the future, in 
<br />
the time travel version--are forever inaccessible to us, then they are 
<br />
essentially nonexistent to us, of no more value to our lives than 
<br />
Lewis' &quot;worlds where unicorns exist&quot; or alternate history novels where 
<br />
Germany won the Second World War.
<br />
<br />For if such other branches _are_ accessible, then if we are not in some 
<br />
special place in the universe these other branches were _also_ 
<br />
accessible to the Throgians in that galaxy in Coma Berenices, enough 
<br />
time ago for the radical implications of MWI travel/communication to 
<br />
produce a massive infusion of knowledge and engineering capabilities.
<br />
<br />Hal's argument that we have not seen either time travelers or MWI 
<br />
traveler's because we have not yet built receivers yet. My argument is 
<br />
&quot;But someone would have by now.&quot; And unless we are in a narrow band of 
<br />
outcomes where some civilizations have done this and are even now 
<br />
expanding toward us but have not yet reached us or produced engineering 
<br />
feats we can observe, they should have shown themselves by now.
<br />
<br />My hunch is that alien civilizations may well exist, but are not 
<br />
abundant (else we'd see the Galactic Federation already here, etc.), 
<br />
and that neither time travel nor MWI travel/communication is possible.
<br />
