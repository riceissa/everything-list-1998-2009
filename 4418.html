<em class="quotelev1">&gt; readable by

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their (professionally well trained) minds walk  - roam around, as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  in a post-post-post modern scientific view.
</em><br />
<br />I've looked over the archives from the time before I was formally 
<br />
subscribed, and I just don't see many differences in &quot;free spirit&quot; (to 
<br />
use your phrase) posts, either in number or in nature.
<br />
<br />In any case, no one is stopping similar posts today. We had a good 
<br />
discussion of the really weird (&quot;free spirit&quot;) Poincare recurrence idea 
<br />
not too long ago. And Bruno continues to post his ideas.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wrote &quot;more conventional&quot; referring to the formalistic classical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the textbooks (not exclusively, but the majority of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list-contributors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to prefer  physics over other 'scientific' disciplines).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not &quot;you&quot;, and my remark was not complaining, rather observing - even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overestimate the &quot;alas&quot; in it. It only means that I enjoy the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'nonconventional' more. I always stood up for free spirit/speech/ideas,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether I was in agreement or not,  and it feels really bad to have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defend myself against the image  of a fascist tyrant. So please, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the omitted 1st par above.
</em><br />
<br />I didn't characterize you as a fascist tyrant...I said that the list is 
<br />
what it is, and that the solution to perceptions that it is no longer 
<br />
as free-spirited is to increase the number of posts you think are 
<br />
needed, not ask others to not critique them or to use &quot;conventional 
<br />
physics&quot; to analyze the new theories.
<br />
<br />This raises an interesting point, one I was thinking about quite a bit 
<br />
last night after sending off my last comment.
<br />
<br />Consider a wild and whacky idea: Vernor Vinge's &quot;slow zone&quot; ontology in 
<br />
some of his short stories (&quot;The Blabber,&quot; for example) and in his 
<br />
award-winning novel, &quot;A Fire Upon the Deep.&quot; For those not familiar 
<br />
with Vinge, he posits that the speed of light varies in certain ways at 
<br />
different places inside galaxies, and that intelligence itself varies 
<br />
within regions of the galaxy. (The precise details don't matter.) The 
<br />
result is that some parts of our galaxy are &quot;slow zones&quot; where 
<br />
intelligence is limited, some parts are &quot;The High Beyond&quot; (I think was 
<br />
his name for it) where intelligence runs at breakneck speed (&quot;the 
<br />
Powers&quot;), and then there are &quot;The Unthinking Depths.&quot;
<br />
<br />This is what is called &quot;a conceit.&quot; Nothing pejorative there. A conceit 
<br />
is an assumption made by an author for the purposes of creating a 
<br />
world, a setting. &quot;His conceit was to imagine a world where Hitler had 
<br />
won the Second World War.&quot;
<br />
<br />Now this is where it gets interesting. When Vinge presents this 
<br />
conceit, this basis for a suspension of disbelief, we the readers may 
<br />
shrug and groan and be skeptical, but the force of a full-length novel 
<br />
and our inability to interact with him in real time means that he &quot;gets 
<br />
a chance.&quot; We get drawn in and we think to ourselves some variant of 
<br />
&quot;OK, a weird idea. Probably completely impossible. Probably easy enough 
<br />
to disprove--I can think of observations which already disprove his 
<br />
speed of light idea. But let's see where he goes with this idea.&quot;
<br />
<br />In Vinge's case, his idea took his novel very far. So though I think 
<br />
his Slow Zone idea is impossible, he at least is thought-provoking, and 
<br />
he even added a metaphor for our times. (Back in the early 90s it was a 
<br />
common joke in my circle to refer to someone as &quot;being in the Slow 
<br />
Zone.&quot;)
<br />
<br />Other writers have done the same thing. Niven in &quot;Ringworld,&quot; faster 
<br />
than light travel in general, Tolkien's Middle Earth, and so on.
<br />
<br />Here's the relevance to this list. Imagine that Vinge subscribed to 
<br />
this list and presented his &quot;Slow Zone&quot; ideas not as a fictional 
<br />
conceit but as a idea tossed out for discussion. He would, of course, 
<br />
be ripped to shreds. People would point out the relevant physics about 
<br />
red shifts, Lamb shifts, gravitational lensing, and so on.
<br />
<br />Vernor knows this, of course. This is the point of a conceit.
<br />
<br />Likewise, one of my current favorite authors is Greg Egan. He tosses 
<br />
out wild ideas and develops them with great enthusiasm. His novels 
<br />
&quot;Distress,&quot; &quot;Quarantine,&quot; &quot;Diaspora,&quot; &quot;Permutation City,&quot; &quot;Schild's 
<br />
Ladder,&quot; etc. are wildly imaginative and thought-provoking. Best of 
<br />
all, he gets to develop his ideas at length and with fictional 
<br />
characters to explicate the details, WITHOUT people like us to point 
<br />
out obvious flaws or lack of observational details.
<br />
<br />(I'll add that I think he's the most realistic author I've seen in a 
<br />
while on how some of the physics may unfold. For example, in some of 
<br />
his novels (SL, Diaspora) he has &quot;new physics&quot; only being discovered a 
<br />
century or so from now, which I think is a plausible timeline. And, 
<br />
even with a new TOE, it takes another thousand years of AI-enhanced 
<br />
thinking before new energy regimes are adequately probed (via an 
<br />
accelerator that is roughly the size of the solar system, to probe 
<br />
Planck scales).)
<br />
<br />The point is this: anyone proposing a &quot;wild theory&quot; here or any other 
<br />
realtime list is going to need to expect folks taking potshots and 
<br />
pointing out inconsistencies and flaws. For most of science, this works 
<br />
very well.
<br />
<br />(The case of Wolfram's &quot;new kind of science&quot; is an excellent example to 
<br />
discuss in this connection. Maybe in another post.)
<br />
<br />We are like the Caltech students that Niven described in the early 70s: 
<br />
they demolished the physics of &quot;Ringworld&quot; and pointed out ways that it 
<br />
could and could not work. How could we be otherwise?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suppose your line:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I cannot understand your point here. But if the &quot;several&quot; who were 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; once
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; here are no longer posting, I am not stopping them.&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; refers to my phrase &quot;'well composed' edifice of the scientific 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doctrines...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (discounting the personal defensive) - maybe if you care to glance at 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'older'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; essay (<a href="http://pages.prodigy.net/jamikes/SciRelMay00.html">http://pages.prodigy.net/jamikes/SciRelMay00.html</a>) that would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; release
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me from lengthy explanations - subject maybe to my newer miscraftings 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here -
</em><br />
<br />OK, I just checked out your URL and scanned your essay. It looks to be 
<br />
about religion and memes. I'm not sure what it has to do with analysis 
<br />
of &quot;Everything&quot; theories a la Tegmark, Egan, Schmidhuber, Fredkin, 
<br />
Zuse, etc.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Again, I have no idea what you are talking about here&lt;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Idea I have, wording is hard. I may mention some key-phrases without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contextual explanations (and without asking Wei Dai to reformulate the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in favor of these &lt;G&gt;) as stirring around lately in select 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speculations:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; -- &quot;complexity-thinking&quot;, -- extending the limits of reductionism:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; induction-buildup, to deduction-analysis,  -- extending the limited 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of reductionist science, -- natural systems as networks of networks, --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total interconnectedness -- etc., but I am afraid that whatever I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mention
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opens another Pandora's box of worms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We (working in these lines) have still arguments how to understand 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; formulate) concepts like impredicative, endogenous, emergent, etc., 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beside
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the re-identification of 'older' terms galore.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I certainly encourage you to more fully explicate your ideas. But 
<br />
understand that I (and others, I think) will &quot;compare and contrast&quot; 
<br />
theories with what has been observed, what appears to be solidly known, 
<br />
etc. This is what we would do if Vinge were to post ideas here, like I 
<br />
said.
<br />
<br />I'm quite skeptical that much of the &quot;complexity-thinking&quot; is as 
<br />
important as some think it is. (I know about Chaitin, and introduced 
<br />
him to the &quot;Extropians&quot; list in 1993, as Hal can confirm. I've also 
<br />
corresponded with him, and I went to the first Artificial Life (A-LIFE) 
<br />
conference in Los Alamos in 1987 largely because I'd read that John 
<br />
Holland, Greg Chaitin, and several others that I wanted to meet would 
<br />
be there...as it turned out, Chaitin cancelled. I've also read the 
<br />
usual complexity theory stuff. Close links with computation and 
<br />
cryptology, of course. But drawing overbroad conclusions, as I think 
<br />
Prigogine does, is why I am skeptical.)
<br />
<br />(To add another comment. At this first A-LIFE I also had a lot of time 
<br />
to talk to Stuart Hameroff about his &quot;nanotubules&quot; and &quot;cytoskellular 
<br />
consciousness&quot; theories. Strange stuff. A perfect example of my 
<br />
novelization point: were Hameroff to develop his ideas in a novel, a 
<br />
well-written and engaging novel, we might be able to say &quot;Weird, but 
<br />
interesting!.&quot; But when I see Hameroff's ideas in essays on the Web, or 
<br />
Penrose's vague claims that gravity may have something to do with 
<br />
quantum weirdness, I remain intensely skeptical.)
<br />
<br />I think there's more than plenty of fascinating new physics being 
<br />
vigorously discussed in the modern physics community. The arXive site 
<br />
is fun to browse.
<br />
<br />When a theory is so weird that it is not even discussable by workers in 
<br />
the field, then our skepticism meters must reflect this.
<br />
<br />Your comments did not &quot;aggravate&quot; me...they simply prodded me to set 
<br />
down some of the many ideas percolating in my head. This may make me 
<br />
seem like a &quot;conservative&quot; here, but it's my nature to analyze and 
<br />
critique, to compare and contrast.
<br />
<br />Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof.
<br />
<br />--Tim May
