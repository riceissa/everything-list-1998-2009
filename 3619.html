<br />I believe that I do understand the issue at hand. It seems that 
<br />
Juergen and I are using &quot;predictive power&quot; in different senses.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree with Juergen that AP does not predict anything by itself. You need
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at least a probability distribution or measure of some sort in addition to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;AP. There has been extensive discussion on this list over exactly what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure should be used, and what the measure is over.
</em><br />
<br />I think that if this is the issue then we are looking at different 
<br />
interpretations of &quot;predictive power&quot;, as I said. My POV is Bayesian. 
<br />
I am not thinking in terms of what you can say about ensembles of 
<br />
universes, but about what you can predict about *this* universe, 
<br />
given the background information that we are here, and other 
<br />
background information that we may already have (about physics for 
<br />
example). One can then write down things like P(a certain nuclear 
<br />
energy level is between x and y|we are here &amp; nuclear physics works 
<br />
in the way we have learned that it does)=1, which is a prediction of 
<br />
where we will observe that nuclear energy level to lie when we get 
<br />
around to observing it (which hadn't been done when Hoyle wrote his 
<br />
paper). That in my book counts as a real prediction of physics, and 
<br />
it is a consequence of the AP...and of other things, I agree. If 
<br />
Juergen's point is that you may need other information than just the 
<br />
AP (such as how particles will behave in certain physical 
<br />
situations), then I will stipulate that. But that's a trivial point. 
<br />
All theories require background information, and a Bayesian is 
<br />
required to include all background information when making inferences 
<br />
(predictions).
<br />
<br />For me (and I believe most scientists) a theory has predictive power 
<br />
if it allows us to accurately predict verifiable facts about *this* 
<br />
physical world, facts that we did not already know. That's exactly 
<br />
what Hoyle did, and it involved the AP, since (as Barrow and Tipler 
<br />
point out) we would not exist (certainly in our present form) if 
<br />
there were no carbon.
<br />
<br />I will point out again, what you have not addressed, that people like 
<br />
Barrow and Tipler, and Tegmark, seem to regard the carbon prediction 
<br />
as a prediction of the AP.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Have you read Juergen's paper &quot;A Computer Scientist's View of Life, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Universe, and Everything&quot;? If not please do so before making any more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;posts. It's at <a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/html.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/everything/html.html</a>.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I have read it. He's talking about ensembles of universes, which 
<br />
isn't what I am talking about. I don't really disagree with anything 
<br />
I saw in that paper, but it's a different topic from what I was 
<br />
addressing.
<br />
<br />Since Juergen and I seem to be talking at cross-purposes about 
<br />
different sorts of predictions, I will put him back on my list to 
<br />
read. I apologize to him for getting annoyed. But I wish that he 
<br />
would agree that there is predictive power in the AP as *I* am using 
<br />
the term, even if not as *he* is using the term. In other words, that 
<br />
his original statement was painting with too broad a brush.
<br />
<br />The AP does have predictive power in the sense that I (as a natural 
<br />
scientist) usually mean it.
<br />
