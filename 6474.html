<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why not instead adopt the scientific model?  That is, that

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we are three-dimensional creatures ensconced in a world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; governed by the laws of physics, or, what I'll call the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;atoms and processes&quot; model. About observer-moments, I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; say what LaPlace answered to Napoleon about a deity:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;I have no need of that hypothesis&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Observer moments are more than a hypothesis, they are our raw experiences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the world.  It is more the world that is the hypothesis to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the observer moments, than vice versa.  &quot;I think, therefore I am... an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moment,&quot; as Descartes meant to say.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I had overstated my case. Thanks for the correction. Still,
<br />
on a certain literal level, I meant what I said: as an *hypothesis*,
<br />
I have no need of observer-moments (any more, say, that I would
<br />
require the existence of telephones as part of a scientific
<br />
*hypothesis*). But I regret implying that I thought they did not
<br />
exist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, given the strong evidence we have for the world's existence and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the explanatory power it gives for our experience, I don't think there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a problem with treating it as fundamental.  This leads to a model of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world -&gt; observers -&gt; observer-moments.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, thank you. This is exactly the ontology I had in mind. As another
<br />
example, laws-of-physics -&gt; atoms-and-minerals -&gt; telephone-sets.
<br />
I have no need of an hypothesis that begins with either observers,
<br />
observer-moments, or consciousness.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A key point is that the mapping is not just one-to-many.  It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many-to-many.  That is, an observer moment is shared among multiple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers; and an observer exists in multiple worlds.
</em><br />
<br />Certainly. This is the usual point of view from the MWI.
<br />
<br />You continue:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [i]  observers merge whenever information is forgotten. And they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      diverge whenever information is learned.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [ii] observers exist in any world which is consistent with their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      observations. 
</em><br />
<br />Basically, yes. But your second point, which I've labeled (ii),
<br />
I think has to be modified in this direction: while it's true
<br />
that I am &quot;in&quot; any universe where I'm observing exactly the
<br />
same sights, sounds, and tactile sensations (regardless of their
<br />
actual histories), it's necessary that it be *me* there, and
<br />
not Joe Schmoe. This is accomplished by introducing a second
<br />
axis that is calibrated by how similar are the internal reactions
<br />
of the entity to mine.
<br />
<br />Now the set of my observations lies on a continuum (e.g.,
<br />
if the colors I'm seeing become too garish or the shapes I'm
<br />
seeing become too unfamiliar, then it's less an observer-moment
<br />
that *I'm* having and more one that someone else is having).
<br />
<br />Likewise, the set of my internal reactions to my observations
<br />
lie on a continuum. Sure, there are Lee Corbins with tails
<br />
who are seeing exactly what I'm seeing and typing exactly what
<br />
I'm typing, but some of them are a lot angrier and more upset
<br />
than I am at having been corrected, and so the coefficient of
<br />
personal identity falls off along this axis too with distance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I see both views - worlds as primary, or observers and observer-moments as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; primary - as playing an important role in understanding our relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the multiverse.
</em><br />
<br />Please explain why observers and observer-moments should sometimes
<br />
be regarded as primary. They're completely derivative in my ontology.
<br />
Of course, it's extremely common for derivative entities, like marks
<br />
on a whiteboard exhibiting mathematical relationships, or telephone-sets,
<br />
or DNA, to be important along the road of making further predictions
<br />
and affording further explanations. But still, all those things,
<br />
(like &quot;observers&quot; and &quot;observer-moments&quot; for me) don't feel
<br />
fundamental. Not as fundamental, for example, as the Standard Model.
<br />
<br />You then outline a nice program for making computations based
<br />
upon observer-moments.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This approach seems to require acknowledgement of the fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; importance both of worlds and observer-moments.  We use worlds to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculate measure; we use observer-moments to constrain the set of worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that we occupy, now and in the future.  A world-only approach would seem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to pin us to a single world and not recognize that we span all worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which contain identical observer-moments;
</em><br />
<br />Well, I was taking &quot;world-only&quot; to include all our best theories
<br />
of physics, in particular QM. And the MWI interpretation of QM
<br />
of course leads us to observer-moments. It didn't occur to me to
<br />
restrict &quot;world&quot; to just one spacetime.
