<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imo, of Descartes &quot;diagonal argument&quot;: it is the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we will find ourselves, at some stage, doubting we doubt

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of everything. The same for relativization: we cannot

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relativize everything without an absolute base on which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that relativization is effective. 
</em><br />
<br />Here is a subtle, and non-traditional thought:
<br />
<br />Classical philosophy always put the Reasoner at the center of the
<br />
structure of reasoning. But with our more developed awareness of
<br />
evolution, evolutionary psychology, cognitive science, it is becoming
<br />
clearer that this pure &quot;Copernican&quot; view of reasoning is invalid.  We
<br />
now can see that every Reasoner is embedded within some a priori
<br />
framework such that there is an intrinsic bias or offset to any
<br />
subjective construct.  When we are aware that there is fundamental bias,
<br />
it is clear that one can not validly reason to the point of doubting
<br />
everything.  When all that is in doubt is removed, we don't arrive at
<br />
zero as is classically thought, but at some indistinct offset determined
<br />
by our very nature as a reasoner embedded in a real environment.
<br />
Understanding this eliminates the pressure to deal with conceptual
<br />
identities leading to meaningless absolutes.
<br />
<br />This understanding also helps resolve other philosophical &quot;paradoxes&quot;
<br />
such as solipsism, meaning of life, free-will and others hinging on the
<br />
idea of a subjective center.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want (like David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and George) consciousness is our criteria of &quot;absolute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (but not 3-communicable) truth&quot;. I don't think we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; genuinely doubt we are conscious, although we can doubt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on any content of that consciousness, but that is different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can doubt having been conscious in some past, but we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot doubt being conscious here and now, whatever that means.
</em><br />
&lt;...&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;truth&quot; here bears on the existence of the experience, and has  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to do with anything which could be reported by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiencer.  
</em><br />
<br />On this basis I understand your point, and as long as we are very
<br />
careful about conveying which particular meaning of &quot;knowing&quot;,
<br />
&quot;certainty&quot;, and &quot;truth&quot; we are referring to, then there will be little
<br />
confusion.  But such dual usage leaves us at risk of our thinking
<br />
repeatedly falling into the singularity of the self, from which there's
<br />
no objective (and thus workable) basis for any claim. 
<br />
<br />My personal experience is that there's no paradox at all if one is
<br />
willing to fully accept that within any framework of description there
<br />
is absolutely no difference at all between a person and a zombie, but
<br />
even the most philosophically cognizant, being evolved human organisms,
<br />
will snap back to defending the existence of a 1st person point of view
<br />
even though it isn't detectable or measurable and has absolutely no
<br />
effect on the physical world. 
<br />
<br />It is virtually impossible for many people to see that even IF the 1st
<br />
person experience actually exists, it can't be described, even by that
<br />
person, except from a third person perspective. That voice in your own
<br />
mind, those images in your imagination, none can be said to be
<br />
experienced without being interpreted.  The idea of direct experience is
<br />
incoherent.  It always carries the implication that there's some other
<br />
process there to have the experience.  It's turtles all the way down.
<br />
<br />The essence of Buddhist training is to accept this non-existence of Self
<br />
at a deep level.  It is very rare, but not impossible to achieve such an
<br />
understanding, and while still experiencing the illusion, to see it as
<br />
an illusion, with no actual boundary to distinguish an imagined self
<br />
from the rest of nature. I think that a machine intelligence, while
<br />
requiring a model of self, would have no need of this illusion which is
<br />
a result of our evolutionary development.
