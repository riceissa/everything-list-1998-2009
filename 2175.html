<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I mean by using 'objective' is that, unless a thought defines it, a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;group of thoughts can not exist. Archimedes, viewing the multiverse from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;without, cannot see any groups of thoughts unless he specifically chooses to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- in which case he can see anything, choose any group he likes. But what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be the point of that? Archimedes can just imagine something without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bothering to look at the multiverse, as he knows for sure that something is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Surely Archimedes can only experience his own thoughts.  If a thought 
<br />
has 'I am Anna' associated with it then Archimedes might be able to 
<br />
imagine what it is like to be Anna experiencing that thought but he 
<br />
could never know what it is like (you can assume that all the 
<br />
thoughts which wrote this paragraph contained the concept of 
<br />
'Archimedes' so in this context he does exist).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You could say, &quot;well this very present thought of mine is defining a group
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of thoughts as all the ones I remember, and calling that group 'Brent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Meeker'&quot;. Congratulations, you have defined yourself into existence! But why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do so? What is the point? What objectives will you meet? The only thing you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;achieve is pander to an urge that is a component of your very present
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thought - an urge to believe 'I exist!' I speculate that all thoughts which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;include 'I am submitting a post to the everything list'  have that urge as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;component.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So this is why I say it is meaningless to declare that Brent Meeker or James
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Higgo exist. It is meaningless to say anything particular thing exists if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everything exists. This means that observers ('selves') do not exist, if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;define them as groups of thoughts - unless they literally think themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into existence! The reason I mention buddhism now and then is that I just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happened to notice that this is buddhist philosophy too - Nirvana is when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you stop willing yourself into existence, and simply enjoy all there is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enjoy, your very present thought.
</em><br />
<br />It's not meaningless to declare an individual exists since there are 
<br />
some thoughts in the multiverse which can only be experienced by 
<br />
Anna. Anna has thought herself into existence and now has thoughts 
<br />
and memories which belong to her alone and which could not be 
<br />
experienced by anything else.  So if all thoughts exist all observers 
<br />
must also exist.  I agree there are some thought which contain no 
<br />
experience of self, but my experience is that these types of thoughts 
<br />
must either have small measure or be not very interesting.
