<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand this last sentence - why couldn't he use the 'Lewisian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defence' if he wanted - it is the Anthropic Principle (or just logic) that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessitates SAS's (in a many worlds context): our existence in a world that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is suitable for us is independent of the uncountability or otherwise of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sets of suitable and unsuitable worlds, it seems to me. (Granted he does use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'm' word in talking about level 4 (and other level) universes, but I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asking why he needs it to provide 'anthropic content'.)
</em><br />
<br />I think the problem is that we can exist even in worlds that are not
<br />
particularly suitable, certainly worlds that are not as simple and
<br />
regular as our own.  Imagine a world in which a human being just pops
<br />
into existence but all around him is chaos.  There would be many more
<br />
such worlds than worlds where the human evolved in a sensible way.
<br />
<br />Likewise we can't derive Occam's Razor or even the reasonableness of
<br />
induction (that the future will be like the past) without some kind of
<br />
measure that favors simple universes.  We could imagine a world in which
<br />
rabbits suddenly start to fly; or one in which horses suddenly start
<br />
to fly; or one in which trees suddenly start to fly; etc.  There are
<br />
apparently many more such worlds than ones which go on as they always
<br />
have.  So again without a measure that somehow favors the predictable
<br />
ones, we can't explain why induction continues to work.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are hints that it may be worth exploring fundamentally different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approaches to the White Rabbit problem when we consider that for Cantor the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of all integers is the same 'size' as that of all the evens (not too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good on its own for deciding whether a randomly selected integer is likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to come out odd or even); similarly for comparing the set of all reals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between 0 and 1000, and between 0 and 1. The standard response to this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that one *cannot* select a real (or integer) in such circumstances - but in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the case of many worlds we *do* have a selection (the one we are in now), so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe there is more to be said than that of applying the Cantor approach to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; real worlds, and also on random selection.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that it is hard to see how we could be experiencing one world
<br />
out of an infinite number of them, if they all had a uniform measure,
<br />
just as we can't pick a truly random integer.  Two solutions are, first,
<br />
to assume that worlds have non-uniform measure, so that each possible
<br />
world has a non-infinitesimal measure.  Or second, even if worlds do have
<br />
infinitesimal measure, observers can be considered as finite machines
<br />
which each span an infinite number of worlds.  Since an observer is only
<br />
finite, he can occupy a fraction of the multiverse which has non-zero
<br />
measure even if the worlds themselves have zero measure.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I use the simple 'limit to infinity' approach to provide a potential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solution to the WR problem (see appendix of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.physica.freeserve.co.uk/pa01.htm">http://www.physica.freeserve.co.uk/pa01.htm</a>) - Russell's paper is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too dissimilar in this area, I think. This approach seems to cover at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the 'countable' region (in Cantorian terms), and also addresses the above
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems (ie odd/even type questions etc). The key point in my philosophy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper is that it is mathematics (and/or information theory) that is more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; likely to map the objective distribution of types of worlds, compared to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular anthropic intuition that is implied by the WR challenge.
</em><br />
<br />I should note that I wrote the above comments before reading your paper,
<br />
and I see that you are familiar with the problems of chaotic universes and
<br />
induction failure that I mentioned.
<br />
<br />Your solution is essentially the one we often discuss here, which is that
<br />
universes with shorter descriptions should be of higher measure than
<br />
those with longer descriptions, simply because a higher percentage of
<br />
infinite strings have a particular short-string prefix than a particular
<br />
long-string prefix.  There are various potential objections to this but
<br />
it is an attractive principle and seems to get us a long way towards
<br />
where we want to go.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A final musing on finite formal systems: I have always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered formal systems to be a provisional 'best guess' (or *maybe* 2nd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best after the informational approach) for exploring the plenitude - but it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurs to me that non-finitary formal systems (which could inter alia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encompass the reals) may match (say SAS-relevant) finite formal systems in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simplicity terms, if the (infinite-length) axioms themselves could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithmically generated. This would lead to a kind of 'meta-formal-system'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; approach. Just a passing thought...
</em><br />
<br />My guess is that any such system, where infinite axioms could be generated
<br />
from a finite starting point, would be equivalent to just using a finite
<br />
axiom set.
