</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not that if I see  'I'  that means 1, but if I see 'III' that does

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not mean 3 to me, it means 111. You have to teach first what those  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; funny 'figures'  (3,7,etc.) mean.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't have to do that. If you follow the thread, you will even  
<br />
understand why I cannot do that. The existence and nature of numbers  
<br />
as well as our understanding of it will remain a mystery. But assuming  
<br />
comp (and thus the numbers), we can understand why this is a necessary  
<br />
mystery. It is part of the unbridgeable gap which has to remain if we  
<br />
want to remain bot scientist and consistent.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you teach: III and IIIIIII &quot;mean&quot; 3 and 7,  then you said  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing, just named them.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That was my point. To talk on notation. I just hope people understand  
<br />
enough the number so that if I ask them to give me 3 euros, they will  
<br />
not give me two or four.
<br />
<br />Later we will axiomatize the theory of numbers. But I prefer to wait  
<br />
to be sure people understand the notion of number before axiomatizing.  
<br />
If I do the axiomatization too early, some people will believe I am  
<br />
rigorously defining the numbers, but this is a grave error. I will  
<br />
axiomatize the number to reason about them and to interview machines  
<br />
about the numbers.
<br />
<br />Numbers are as mysterius as consciousness and time. That is why  
<br />
mathematicians does not even try. But wait for the next thread, I will  
<br />
give a definition of numbers (which sometimes makes some mathematician  
<br />
believed we have a definition). But it will not be a definition, just  
<br />
a representation in term of another notion, av-ctually the notion of  
<br />
set. of course the notion of set is richer and even less definable  
<br />
than numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; No content meant. Quantity???(vs. number?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Having 10 digits on 2 hands is the 2nd mental evolutionary step  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after recognizing 5 digits on 1 hand, which was the earlier stage  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (among others old Hungarians  had that and a folks music in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pentatonic scale). The 'ancient' computer-folks have ony 2 digits on  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their mind, Yin and Yang (0 and 1) and voila they made lots of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; marvels from this simplified system already. (You have that).  And  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the French? with quatrevingtdix for nonante? XC is not XX-XX-XX-XX- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; X  - Romans still recognizing the '5' as a basic tenet (V, L, D,) as  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cornerstones in their number system.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also your digital 0,9,8,7,6 and then 5,4,3,2,1 was trouble in  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ancient Rome..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Romans had no zero, yet used a (quasi) decimal system.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;decimal&quot;? Without zero there is no position based notation for the  
<br />
number.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However they did not write IIII rather IV and then for 9: IX  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anticipating V and X as the next one. They also subtracted 4 from 7  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as counting backwards: like 7,6,5,4, which made 7-4=4 in all  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calendar countings which was based on the subtraction of day-numbers  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the next 'fix' day in the month. Can you figure the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consequences of this in paying interest (or taxes?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (That may be the reason why Muslims are banned from counting  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interest).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think your teaching is fine, but one has to know it before  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learning it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And: as a nun said to a friend when she had questions 'upon  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking': &quot;you  should not &quot;think&quot;, you should believe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; About the 12 digital creation: In J.Cohen - J.Stewart ('Chaos' and  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Reality') the Zarathustran 'aliens' had an 8 based thinking  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (octimal) as best and perfect. Well, 10 gives a prime after one  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; halfing, 12 after two, 8 after 3. I think there were 12 digit  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creatures but failed. 10 proved practical - maybe not because of the  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decimal as best mathematical system. It just survived...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Your teachings made an enjoyable reading, thank you. I confess: I  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did not count the 'I'-s just believed that there are 2009 of them.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is not magical, in other calendar-countings the year has quite  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different number of 'I'-s.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I should ask a question: how would one note 1 billion on the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; planet of centipeds with 8 fingers on all 100 feet? (Don't answer,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; please). (Q2: which billion? the 1000M or the MM?)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Kim,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I told you that to grasp the seventh step we have to do some &quot;little&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amount of math.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now math is a bit like consciousness or time, we know very well what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is, but we cannot really define it, and such an encompassing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition can depend on the philosophical view you can have on &quot;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical reality&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, if I try to be precise enough so that the math will be applicable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not just on the seventh step, but also on the 8th step and eventually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the sketch of the AUDA, that is the arithmetical translation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the universal dovetailer argument, I am tempted by providing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophical clues, deducible from the comp hypothesis, for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduction to math.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I realize that this would entail philosophical discussion right at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the beginning, and that would give to you the feeling that, well,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elementary math is something very difficult, which is NOT the case.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The truth is that philosophy of elementary math is difficult.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I have change my mind, and we will do a bit of math. Simply. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; far best to have a practice of math before getting involved in more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subtle discussion, even if we will not been able to hide those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subtleties when applying the math to the foundation of physics and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cognition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I propose to you a shortcut to the seventh step. It is not a thorough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduction to math. Yet it starts from the very basic things.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Let us begin. What I explain here is standard, except for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notations, and this for mailing technical reason.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess you have heard about the Natural Numbers, also called Positive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Integers. By default, when I use the word number, it will mean I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning the natural number.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess you agree with the statement that 0 is equal to the number of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurrence of the letter &quot;y&quot; in the word &quot;spelling&quot;. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then you have the number 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. OK? They are respectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equal to the number of stroke in I, II, III, IIII, etc. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course the number four is not equal to &quot;IIII&quot;. But the string, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence of symbols &quot;IIII&quot; is a good notation for the number four. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notation is good in the sense that it is quasi self-explaining. To see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what number is denoted by a string like &quot;IIIIIIIIIII&quot;: just count the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strokes. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that stroke sequences are conceptually good for describing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers, it happens that it is horrible for using them, and you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably used to the much more modern positional notation for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number. If I ask you which year we are. You will not answer me that we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are in the year
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You will most probably tell me that we are in the year 2009.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is that not a bit magical? The explanation of that &quot;miracle&quot; relies in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the very ingenuous way we can use our hands to count on our fingers or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digits. We put 0 on a little finger, and then 1 on the next up to 4,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and then we use the other hand to continue with 5 on the thumb, 6,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then 7, then 8, then 9 on the last right fingers. Unfortunately we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lack fingers to continue, so we will describe the next number by 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times the number of finger + 0 unities. We have 10 fingers, meaning 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times the number of fingers + 0.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Humans have ten fingers, that is why they use ten symbols 0, 1, 2, 3,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is very useful. Later I will perhaps explain that the benefit of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a notation is exponential, and in our story the exponential will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recurre again and again and again .... Indeed a Universal Machine can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be considered as a generalized exponential, but let me try to not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anticipate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example let us take the number 378. This is an abbreviation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (8 times 1) + (7 times 10) + (3 times (10 times 10)), or if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prefer:  3 times (10 times 10) + 7 times 10 + 8 times 1, like the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number 2009 is an abbreviation of 9 + (0 times 1) + (0 times 10) +  (0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times (10 times 10)) + (2 times (10 times 10 times 10).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Are OK with this? As you have learned in school, this notation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provides method for adding and multiplying the numbers, and I will not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elaborate on this now.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And now an important question about math (and not philosophy of math).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What if God created us with 12 fingers? Would the math be different?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, there is a planet near Alpha Centaury where God was a bit lazy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and decide to create creature with only one finger to each hands (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yes, they have two hands thanks God).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could they notate the numbers? Well let us count on their fingers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They can use only two symbols, like in the Yi King and in Leibnitz: 0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 1. But for the number two, they already have to use the positional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trick: 2 is really (1 times the number of fingers) + 0 unity: that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they wrote two as 10. And three? easy: it is 10 + 1, and this gives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 11. That is three is equal to 1 times (number of fingers) + 1. And  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; four?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, let us try the addition trick you have learned:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 11
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; +1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I start at the right, and I compute 1+1, well this gives two, that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10, so I write 0, and I report 1:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 11
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; +1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ---
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and 1 + 1 gives 10 again, so we get 100. Let us verify 100, is an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; abbreviation, for those extra-terrestrials for 0 + (0 times two) + (1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; times (two times two), where &quot;two&quot; is the number of fingers they have,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and this gives indeed four. OK
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So we get the number in their &quot;two-fingers&quot; positional system:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1001 is the number nine, it is the number of strokes in IIIIIIIII. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could feel like if 1001 is already long, but the gain can be shown to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be still exponential. Indeed you can see that:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 0 = 0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2 = 10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 4 = 100
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 8 = 1000
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 16 = 10000
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 32 = 100000
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 18446744073709551616 =
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The last one is (2 times 2 times 2 times ... times 2) with 64 &quot;two&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 64 and the numbers on the left are described in our notation system,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and on the right their are described in the two fingers system. It is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a number which can no more be printed on paper on this planet. Indeed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if you want print it in the stroke notation: indeed it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 18446744073709551616 strokes long! It is big, but this is relative,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and is very little compared to the monstrous numbers that universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine can met.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You see that &quot;4&quot;, &quot;IIII&quot;, and &quot;100&quot; are just different notations for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same positive integers. Tell me if you are OK with this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mathematical truth will have to be invariant for change of notation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yet when I say that positional notation gives an exponential benefit,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am using math (the exponential) to talk about math notations. Well,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even those truth about notations will have to be invariant for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change of notations. This &quot;subtlety&quot; will grow in importance au fur et
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; à mesure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Facultative exercises: 1) try to find a rule for going from the two-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fingers notation to our ten fingers notation, and vice versa, and 2)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what about the planet near Vega, where God, very generous that day,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; give 8 fingers to each hands for the creatures there (and yes, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have two hands). Hint: those are using the 16 ciphers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obligatory home work: 1) keep this post or a copy in a place you can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find it for later reference. 2) Make sure you are OK everywhere I ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you if you are OK?, and if not please ask a question or make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comment. There will be errors, for sure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Next lesson: numbers and other numbers. It should be more interesting,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the lesson of today has some role.
