Hi Russell

<br />&nbsp;Thanks for the long exposition. I am not sure I can do

&nbsp;it justice but I will give it a shot...

<br />
&nbsp;The Maudlin Olympia/Klara argument (equivalently Marchal's filmed
<br />
&nbsp;graph argument) has convinced that the brain is quantum mechanical to
<br />
&nbsp;some extent. I am largely unimpressed by the works of others who've
<br />
&nbsp;argued this point, however, eg Penrose, Stapp or Lockwood. I'm
<br />
&nbsp;sceptical that the brain is a quantum computer. My suspicions, which I
<br />
&nbsp;argue in my book, as well as many times on this list, is that a
<br />
&nbsp;certain amount indeterminism is exploited, and indeed perhaps required
<br />
&nbsp;by consciousness. Thus it would negate the strictest version of YD -
<br />
&nbsp;one would not survive with your &quot;brain&quot; replaced by a Turing
<br />
&nbsp;machine. However, I do think it is possible to replace one's brain by
<br />
&nbsp;a machine of some sort, provided one doesn't restrict it to the Turing
<br />
&nbsp;class of machines.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Now I find that a much more reasonable position than that of Bruno's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and pretty much akin to my own proclivities on the subject! I too am 
<br />
not
<br />
&nbsp;convinced by Penrose et al. but I have some grounded suspicion that
<br />
&nbsp;the brain is not Turing emulable. Even John Searle agrees that the
<br />
&nbsp;brain is a machine of some sort, just not a Turing-like machine!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[RS]
<br />
&nbsp;How does this affect Bruno's UDA? As far as I can tell, steps 1-6 go
<br />
&nbsp;through as before, but after that the conclusions are not so clear.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;But isn't step 1 the YD?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[RS]
<br />
&nbsp;Now as for deriving physics from properties of the observer, what I've
<br />
&nbsp;achieved is a derivation of the following quantum mechanical
<br />
&nbsp;postulates:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;1) That states are vectors in a complex Hilbert space
<br />
&nbsp;2) These vectors evolve according to a unitary differential equation
<br />
&nbsp;(aka Schrodinger equation)
<br />
&nbsp;3) The Born rule
<br />
<br />&nbsp;There is usually only one other postulate given in QM, the so called
<br />
&nbsp;correspondence principle, which connects the quantum world with the
<br />
&nbsp;classical. I have not obtained the correspondence principle, but Vic
<br />
&nbsp;Stenger gets most of the way by appeal to gauge invariance.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;I don't find any of the above (axioms) very hard to derive from
<br />
&nbsp;classical local assumptions. Indeed Schrodinger derived his
<br />
&nbsp;equations from classical mechanics (plus the de Brogie ansatz).
<br />
&nbsp;But this is NOT the whole of quantum mechanics as I am sure
<br />
&nbsp;you know. It also does not sound like a one way ticket to a
<br />
&nbsp;MW version of QM but it is surely closer than to conventional QM.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[RS]
<br />
&nbsp;My assumptions for obtaining these postulates?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;1) The &quot;everything&quot; assumption, or that we are seeing a single
<br />
&nbsp;possibility from the ensemble of all possibilities. This is roughly
<br />
&nbsp;equivalent, I believe to Bruno's Arithmetic Platonism, however
<br />
&nbsp;strictly speaking it is identical to assuming the existence of the
<br />
&nbsp;output of his universal dovetailer.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;2) A uniform measure on the ensemble of possibilities
<br />
<br />&nbsp;3) A subjective experience of time. By this, I mean that we perceive
<br />
&nbsp;an ordered series of &quot;observer moments&quot; (using the terminology of
<br />
&nbsp;this list), or &quot;worlds&quot; to use say Modal logic terminology. Being
<br />
&nbsp;ordered, they can be mapped to the real numbers by an order
<br />
&nbsp;preserving map, and this defines a unique topology. By fixing the
<br />
&nbsp;map (which is arbitrary), one induces a metric upon time, or in
<br />
&nbsp;other words defines a clock. This is the physicist's notion of time
<br />
&nbsp;- coordinate time and proper time.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;4) Our knowledge of the world is updated according to an evolutionary
<br />
&nbsp;process. I apply Lewontin's 3 criteria of evolutionary processes,
<br />
&nbsp;variation, selection and heritability. Our successor &quot;observer
<br />
&nbsp;moment&quot; is selected from the range of possible observer moments
<br />
&nbsp;according to a probability distribution, from heritability we get
<br />
&nbsp;unitary differential evolution.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;That sounds quite interesting to me already, if you can do that much,
<br />
&nbsp;though I cannot vouch for any of those assumptions (except perhaps 2)
<br />
&nbsp;without probing a bit your &quot;everything&quot; and your &quot;observer moments&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;(3) sounds quite reasonable and promising and not very different from
<br />
&nbsp;recent speculative programs developed by Page and Brandon Carter.
<br />
&nbsp;I am not sure about the evolutionary argument but physicists abuse
<br />
&nbsp;those quite regularly so I would not blame you.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;[RS]
<br />
&nbsp;That's about it. I'll let you read the book. Assumption 3) above
<br />
&nbsp;(which I call TIME), I believe is derivable from COMP (though not the
<br />
&nbsp;converse). Bruno is not sure, and we occasionally argue about
<br />
&nbsp;it. However, reading Lockwood's book, I notice that it could also be
<br />
&nbsp;called neo-Cartesianism, that is a belief that consciousness is
<br />
&nbsp;unified, and has a single stream of consciousness. It is perhaps
<br />
&nbsp;somewhat controversial (given that the brain is nothing like that - it
<br />
&nbsp;is parallel, distributed and rather &quot;messy&quot;), however Lockwood gives a
<br />
&nbsp;spirited defence of this position, and uses it as his cornerstone for
<br />
&nbsp;arguing the quantum mechanical nature of the brain. Also Daniel
<br />
&nbsp;Dennett argues for a similar point of view, which he uses the label
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Joycean machine&quot;. From my point of view, it appears to be necessary
<br />
&nbsp;to get the laws of physics as we known them. If there were people
<br />
&nbsp;around with a different sort of mind, do they see a different sort of
<br />
&nbsp;physics? Lots of questions.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;For getting the rest of physics from this program, I can only really
<br />
&nbsp;speculate at this stage. We need to know why we live in a 3D world,
<br />
&nbsp;once this fact is established, gauge invariance gets us most of the
<br />
&nbsp;rest of the way.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Cheers
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;I am not sure I follow you that far. Stenger has some pretty radical
<br />
&nbsp;views some of which I share. But last time I checked he embraced
<br />
&nbsp;something like the infamous &quot;transactional interpretation&quot; of QM
<br />
&nbsp;developed by John Cramer which has some serious problems on
<br />
&nbsp;its own. I'll try and get to your book shortly.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Thanks,
<br />
