Bruno,
<br />
<br />Taking your assumption that I am a machine or number and so I can be 
<br />
plugged into an equation (You = Tom or George...), I will say speaking 
<br />
for myself that I would like a couple of days to think about this.  If 
<br />
we all are one person, then I will not be surprised that George feels 
<br />
the same way.  However, the &quot;or&quot; in the equation &quot;You = Tom or 
<br />
George...&quot; is already non-constructive.  :)
<br />
<br />On the topic of non-constructiveness, the controversial use of the 
<br />
excluded middle is in the context of infinity, not in the finite.  I 
<br />
previously agreed that you did not leave the finite.  But now I have a 
<br />
doubt.  It seems that the diagonalization step you have already taken 
<br />
actually uses the excluded middle for a countable infinity.  Given a 
<br />
(countably infinite) sequence of functions f1, f2, ..., you say that 
<br />
fn(n)+1 must either be in the sequence OR not in the sequence.
<br />
<br />But I will take some of my rare spare time (which I always have by 
<br />
diagonalization) to think some more about this absoluteness of 
<br />
computability and Church Thesis, etc. and try to understand this and 
<br />
solve the puzzle of where your straw-man argument is wrong.
<br />
<br />Speaking of straw-men, it seems you are saying that machines simply 
<br />
running programs, without axioms and inference rules, are like zombies. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Zombies are how I would traditionally think of machines, but you seem 
<br />
to be saying that the axioms and inference rules somehow breathe life 
<br />
into the machine.
<br />
<br />Tom

<br />
<br />Hi,
<br />
<br />Here is a little test, just for singling out a typical non
<br />
intuitionistic (non constructive) argument.
<br />
<br />Such kind of argument makes me recall the tale: &quot;The Little Prince&quot;
<br />
written by the French pilot and novelist St-Exupery, where the Little
<br />
Prince asked the narrator (a pilot) to draw a sheep. But he can't draw
<br />
at all and fails badly in all his attempt to draw a sheep, so that
<br />
after a while, and because the Little Prince insisted so much,
<br />
eventually he decided to draw just a box, and told the little Prince
<br />
that the sheep was in the box.
<br />
<br />Well, classical mathematicians does that all the time: actually they do
<br />
it each time they prove the existence of some object without exhibiting
<br />
precisely that object. Constructivist and engineers can be
<br />
disappointed, but platonist or classical mathematicians are quite cool
<br />
with such non-constructive proof.
<br />
I know by experience that even if I give the solution of the *puzzle*,
<br />
many people does not really see the non constructive step. So let me
<br />
first illustrate such a non-constructive reasoning on a very cute
<br />
example.
<br />
<br />It is a &quot;well known&quot; proof that there exist irrational numbers x, y,
<br />
such that x^y is rational. We don't ask that x should be different of
<br />
y. The question is really (in english): is it possible that a
<br />
irrational number  exponentiated by an irrational number gives a
<br />
rational number?
<br />
<br />(I recall that a positive real number r is rational iff there exist
<br />
natural numbers n and m such that r is equal to m/n.   r will be said
<br />
to be  irrational if r is not rational. A typical irrational number is
<br />
the square root of 2, written sqrt(2)).
<br />
<br />Here is the delightful proof by Jarden.
<br />
<br />First note that a real number is either rational or ... irrational.
<br />
Right?
<br />
<br />Well, if you say &quot;yes&quot; to this, you have already leave the constructive
<br />
area!!!! You have accepted the principle of excluded middle saying that
<br />
for any well-defined proposition p, either p is true, or p is false. In
<br />
this case p is, for some real number r, the proposition &quot;r is
<br />
rational&quot;. The excluded middle principle gives then:  &quot;r is rational or
<br />
r is not rational&quot;, or &quot;r is rational or is irrational&quot;.
<br />
<br />Good ... So you agree that the real number sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2), that is:
<br />
the (square root of two) exponentiated up to the (square root of two)
<br />
is rational or irrational. Right?
<br />
<br />So we have just two cases to consider:
<br />
<br />1) sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is rational. Well, in that case we have a
<br />
solution: x = y = sqrt(2).
<br />
2) sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) is irrational.  In that case just take x =
<br />
(sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2)), and y = sqrt(2). Then, if you remember elementary
<br />
algebra, i.e. that ((a^b)^c) = a^(bc), then you see that x^y = 2 which
<br />
is rational of course.
<br />
<br />So in all cases we have end up with an irrational which exponentiated
<br />
up to some irrational gives a rational, and we have solve the existence
<br />
problem. If you ask me a precise (constructive) solution, this
<br />
reasoning is not satisfactory. But the reasoning is far from hopeless:
<br />
the solution is given to you in a box, the box (set) containing the
<br />
couple (sqrt(2) , sqrt(2)) and the couple (sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) ;
<br />
sqrt(2)). I can, like St-Exupery, tell you that the solution is in the
<br />
two-elements box:
<br />
<br />{   (x = sqrt(2) ;   y = sqrt(2))      (x = sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) ;   y =
<br />
sqrt(2))   }
<br />
<br />But I cannot tell you which one, among the two solutions, is the
<br />
correct one.
<br />
<br />Put in a different way I did prove a non-constructive OR proposition. I
<br />
have proved that
<br />
<br />[&quot;x = sqrt(2) , y = sqrt(2)&quot; is the solution]  OR  [&quot;x= sqrt(2) ^
<br />
sqrt(2) ; y = sqrt(2)&quot; is the solution].
<br />
<br />And the or is non constructive because my reasoning does not allow us
<br />
to choose between the solution proposed on the left of the &quot;or&quot; or if
<br />
it is the one on the right of the &quot;or&quot;.
<br />
<br />In this present case, highly complex number theory (including elliptic
<br />
function theory, modular form, etc.) can settle the disjunction
<br />
constructively, but in theoretical computer science, on the contrary,
<br />
we will met many non-constructive &quot;or&quot; which can be proved being
<br />
necessarily non constructive. That means the non constructive solution
<br />
is the best we can ever hope for.
<br />
<br />And that will be the case for the solution of the *puzzle*.
<br />
<br />I don't want to jeopardize the pleasure of searching that solution, and
<br />
so I let you think a little bit more. Normally, with what Jesse and
<br />
Hall (notably) told, and what you have already seen, + the present
<br />
post, you have all the tools in the hands to explain exactly and
<br />
precisely how we can generate all computable functions in a way
<br />
vaccinated from the diagonalization procedure.
<br />
<br />Of course, the &quot;or&quot; of the first person talk about its future personal
<br />
memory in the Washington Moscow duplication is also a special sort of
<br />
non constructive OR. Also, in the field of theoretical artificial
<br />
intelligence (or computational learning theory), it can be shown that
<br />
almost all &quot;OR&quot; are necessarily non constructive, making almost the
<br />
entire field completely empty from an intuitionist perspective.
<br />
Another example: I insist all the time that the correct part of the
<br />
Penrose-Lucas use of Godel's theorem is that it does not show that we
<br />
are not machine, but only that if we are machines then we cannot know
<br />
which one we are, and this means that the proposition &quot;I am a machine&quot;
<br />
*does* necessarily leave the constructive area. The proposition &quot;I am a
<br />
machine&quot; is equivalent (with Church thesis) with the proposition &quot;I am
<br />
M1 OR I am M2 OR I am M3 OR I am M4 OR ...&quot;, with Mi giving an
<br />
enumeration of all machine (exist by CT). Given that I cannot know
<br />
which machine I am, all those &quot;OR&quot; are non constructive. Of course I
<br />
anticipate here.
<br />
<br />OK so far? Do you want to know the solution? Do you prefer to think
<br />
about all this a couple of days?
<br />
You = Tom, or George, or others ...
<br />
Be sure to understand the problem before I give the solution. We really
<br />
are at the heart of the matter, not just of Smullyan's FU, but of all
<br />
my own work and what I am trying to say. All the nuances between the
<br />
arithmetical plotinian hypostases will emerge thanks to all those
<br />
nuances between computations, proofs, constructive, not constructive,
<br />
etc.
