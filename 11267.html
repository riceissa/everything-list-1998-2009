xxxxx_at_piksel
<br />
<br />13-14 October, Cinemateket USF,Bergen, Norway
<br />
<br />Two days of seminar, discussion and highly practical interrogation of
<br />
expanded
<br />
software and the impact of the executable on necessarily open hardware as a
<br />
political act.
<br />
<br />xxxxx crashes into the intent of open hardware, eviscerating software; the
<br />
blunt realm of the user as cynical economic motif. After Artaud, the CPU
<br />
(central processing unit) and its double mimes The Theatre and its Double.
<br />
On
<br />
the one hand, there is the System or entropic operation of a necessarily
<br />
cynical machine for living, an atrocity exhibition, on the other hand the
<br />
specification of an artistic CPU for life coding. The data sheet will be
<br />
examined as to its operational codes (day one), new (simulation) models will
<br />
be constructed (day two).
<br />
<br />Confirmed participants:
<br />
Wilfried Hou Je Bek, Martin Howse, Jonathan Kemp, Aymeric Mansoux, Bruno
<br />
Marchal, Otto Roessler, Tom Schouten, Marloes de Valk, Eva Verhoeven,
<br />
Valentina Vuksic
<br />
<br />Produced by BEK and ap/xxxxx:
<br />
<br />ap/xxxxx[1] was founded in 1998 to necessitate the code-terms expansion
<br />
implied by a growing and politically active free software movement. With
<br />
wilfully avant-garde intent, and through intervention, performance, staged
<br />
events, seminars, hardware constructions and readily accessible software,
<br />
ap/xxxxx examines through live descriptive process software (culture and
<br />
history), embedding auto-destruction. Software is viewed as substance.
<br />
<br />Piksel[2] is an annual event for artists and developers working with open
<br />
source audiovisual software. Part workshop, part festival, it is organised
<br />
in
<br />
Bergen, Norway, by the Bergen Centre for Electronic Arts (BEK)[3] and
<br />
involves participants from more than a dozen countries exchanging ideas,
<br />
coding, presenting art and software projects, doing workshops, performances
<br />
and discussions on the aesthetics and politics of open source and free
<br />
culture. This years event - Piksel06[4] – continues the exploration of
<br />
audiovisual code and it's myriad of expressions, but also brings in open
<br />
hardware as a new focus area.
<br />
<br />Information:
<br />
<br />xxxxx_at_piksel[5] will take place 11am to 3pm 13 October, 11am to 5pm 14
<br />
October at Cinemateket USF[6], Bergen, Norway as part of the Piksel06
<br />
festival.
<br />
<br />Admission is free but with a limited number of seats. For reservation send a
<br />
mail to: piksel06.domain.name.hidden
<br />
<br />About the participants:
<br />
<br />**Wilfried Hou Je Bek (NL)
<br />
<br />Applying scientific rigour and an eminently wide-ranging frame of
<br />
crytsalpunk reference, socialfiction.org protaganist Wilfried Hou Je
<br />
Bek plays out the expressively elegant and digressional expansion of
<br />
software across all (literalised) domains, for example algorithmic
<br />
psychogeography.
<br />
<br />**Martin Howse (UK)
<br />
<br />Speculative and necessarily open hardware explorer Martin Howse
<br />
proposes a denuded artistic CPU (an elaborated, auto-destructive
<br />
bachelor-culture machine) running heavily promiscuous code and
<br />
operating on a noise terrain. Latest plans include the staging of the
<br />
xxxxx research institute in Berlin.
<br />
<br /><br />**Jonathan Kemp (UK)
<br />
Performer, theorist, ap/xxxxx collaborator and visual artist, Jonathan Kemp
<br />
applies the refined instruments of his adoptive stoneworking to excavate the
<br />
esoteric thought matter of characters such as Emmanuel Swedenborg and
<br />
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.
<br />
<br />**Bruno Marchal (BE)
<br />
Bruno Marchal is currently occupied with refining his supremely elegant,
<br />
code-based theories of COMP at the IRIDIA AI labs in Brussels. COMP has
<br />
precise consequences, for example that physics is necessarily a branch of
<br />
computer science; the implication being that &quot;if you were in a perfect
<br />
simulation you wouldn't know it.&quot;
<br />
<br />**Otto Roessler (DE)
<br />
German biochemist Otto E. Roessler occupies the rare contemporary position
<br />
of
<br />
a scientific and artistic polymath with noted significant contributions to
<br />
chaos theory, under his original attractor, and the fresh science of
<br />
endophysics. His current major project, Lampsacus, proposes a truly free
<br />
networked informational society.
<br />
<br />**Eva Verhoeven (NL)
<br />
The original work of artist and theorist Eva Verhoeven proposes a concise
<br />
and
<br />
well defined series of laboratory-style experiments and interventions which
<br />
elaborate a trajectory from noise/interference within existent (computer)
<br />
systems towards totally speculative hardware.
<br />
<br />**Valentina Vuksic (DE)
<br />
Former student of both essential economics and computer science, Valentina
<br />
Vuksic explores a highly individual articulation of hard and software
<br />
mediation; the processes in such intermediate space as action thus implying
<br />
actors rendered audible through novel intrusion.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;**Tom Schouten (BE)
<br />
Artist and independent software developer. He is the author of PDP, an
<br />
extension for Pure Data, which adds building blocks for image and video
<br />
processing, and other media oriented applications, tightly integrated to the
<br />
computer music system which hosts it. Currently he is developing Packet
<br />
Forth, a stand-alone application / scripting language for media processing
<br />
and BADNOP, an interactive FORTH compiler for Microchip Picmicro
<br />
microcontrollers.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;**Aymeric Mansoux (FR)
<br />
Since the mid-nineties, Aymeric Mansoux has taken part in many artistic
<br />
experiments based on the internet and the emergence of networks.
<br />
Traceroutes,
<br />
network packets, digital feedbacks and piped logs become a new clay that can
<br />
be used to develop autonomous artistic processes. Currently an mphil/PhD?
<br />
student at the creative technologies department of the University of
<br />
Huddersfield, his most recent artistic projects include a residency at the
<br />
Mediacentre of Huddersfield, a collaboration with Chun Lee within the live
<br />
electronic music group 0xA, and Metabiosis, a project on non-carbon based
<br />
pseudo live forms in distributed computing and peer-to-peer networked
<br />
ecosystems with the Dutch artist Marloes de Valk.
<br />
<br />**Marloes de Valk (NL)
<br />
Dutch audiovisual artist, currently based in the UK. She studied Sound and
<br />
Image at the Royal Conservatory in the Hague, specializing in abstract
<br />
compositional computer games, HCI and crashing computers. Starting out as a
<br />
visual artist who played violin, she ended up bringing the worlds of sound
<br />
and image together by building her own digital instruments in which sound
<br />
and
<br />
image are of equal importance, created real-time, simultaneously,
<br />
influencing
<br />
and distorting each other. Currently she is collaborating with French artist
<br />
Aymeric Mansoux on Metabiosis, a project investigating the ups and downs of
<br />
datapackets living in a world of connected ecosystems. Marloes is part of
<br />
the
<br />
Digital Research Unit at the University of Huddersfield.
