Grudging kudos to Jacques for seeing where this question came from,
<br />
and its connection to the Quantum Suicide experiment.  I haven't posted
<br />
any follow-ups for a while because I still find the whole thing quite
<br />
perplexing.
<br />
<br />I agree that the concept &quot;that one's measure is somehow distributed 
<br />
among the so called computational continuations of one's brain activity&quot;
<br />
leads inevitably to the concept of near-zombies.  The description of 
<br />
making a million copies of one person is a good illustration.  Each of
<br />
those copies has only a one millionth chance of &quot;being&quot; the original
<br />
person, so we should not be as concerned when one of those dies as 
<br />
when someone else, who has never been copied, dies.  But is this a
<br />
refutation of the concept, by reductio-ad-absurdum?  I don't think so.
<br />
<br />I want to clarify one thing, though, in Jacques' post:

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;     Assume that all three branches occur (two copying events).
</em><br />
<br />If there are two copying events, then there is no place for a coin
<br />
toss to enter into the experiment, so the 'T' and 'H' should be
<br />
erased from the diagram.  The point is still made that, at time t0,
<br />
Jane would figure:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(left branch, t1) = 1/2, P(right branch, t1) = 1/2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(Y, t3) = 1/2, P(R, t3) = 1/4, P(B, t3) = 1/4
<br />
<br />Which would imply that the two copies of her that saw red and blue
<br />
would be less likely to be the same Jane at t0, so in some sense, 
<br />
they would be less human, you might say.
<br />
<br />Getting back to the original problem, I can think of six possible
<br />
resolutions (can anyone add to this list):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;1.  The term &quot;subjective probability&quot; is meaningless.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems to be what Wei has said, and I think I understand
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hal to have weighed in likewise.  :)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that Hal said was that we might not be able to expect
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be able to determine the subjective probabilities given this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular problem, because we have no experience with copy
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machines.  But we do have experience with something similar,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;anti-copy&quot; machines.  People die all the time!  According to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacques, each of us can expect to die.  Yet we still expect that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we should be able to predict subjective probabilities.  That's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what physics is all about, and it seems to work pretty well.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2.  The term &quot;subjective probability&quot; is meaningful, but given the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem as stated, there is not enough information to determine
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be true, but I can't imagine what other information
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might make the problem tractible.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;3.  Subjective probabilities can be computed, but the assumption
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that consciousness can &quot;flow&quot; to a continuation independent of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time or space is flawed.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I think, is Jacques' point of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view.  Though he didn't state it, I would guess that he would
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H, t1) = P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 1/2, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that the original Jane would necessarily feel herself to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continue along with her original body.  That is, if, in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above diagram, at the copying event after Jane sees Heads, we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;assume that the original Jane is the one who is shown the Red
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;card, then Jane at t1 would say
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(R) = 1,   P(B) = 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copy of Jane who sees the blue card is a new person, who
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was just &quot;born&quot; at the instant the copy was made, even though
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she has all the same memories as the original.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, as I suggested, the original is destroyed, and two copies
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are made, then alas, poor Jane is dead!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reject this option, because it seems like Cartesian dualism
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to me, to assume that there is some sort of magical res-cogitans
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that stays with the body.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;4.  Subjective probabilities can be computed on the basis of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong SSA, and we get
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H, t1) = 1/2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 2/3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the case, then I think we have to throw Tegmark's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scheme using Bayesian statistics out the window.  This option
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has severe metaphysical problems, though, in my opinion.  I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think Hal was saying, in his post, either this option, or
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;option 1 above, but I'm not sure.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;5.  Subjective probabilities can be computed, and we should expect
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the common-sense results
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H, t1) = 1/2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 1/2
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a fair coin, after all, right?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this gets Gilles' and Bruno's vote (and Russell's?)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;6.  Subjective probabilities can be computed, and we should expect
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the nonsensical results
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H, t1) = 2/3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P(H, t2) = P(H, t3) = 2/3
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I believe is probably true.  I think that there 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;must be a sort of &quot;reverse causality&quot; at work, which would 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase the measure of the right branch of Jane at time t1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(the branch that sees heads, but before the copy is made).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This still has Jacques' problem of allowing pseudo-zombies.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we switch to Jacques' example and assume two copying events,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the Jane on the left branch, at time t1, would have less
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measure than the Jane on the right (note the contrast between
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this result and the previous, where the Janes that were the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;product of the second copying operation were accorded less
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measure).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don't see this as a problem.  What I'm suggesting is that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each human alive today has a varying amount of &quot;measure&quot;.  It's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incorrect to assume that each person, when they are born, is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given a single &quot;measure unit&quot;.  By my scheme, a person with a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terminal illness with only a few days to live would have a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;very small measure of existence, relative to others.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't help wondering, often, why I find myself to be the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;particular human I am.  Do you others wonder this?  One thought
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've had (please don't laugh at me too badly) is that the fact
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I have a pretty poor memory might be significant.  If I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had a better memory, then my measure would be less, because
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fewer universes could have given rise to me.  Of course, this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasoning probably won't work for you, but that doesn't make it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any less valid from my perspective, which is the only one I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I came to believe in this &quot;reverse causality&quot; while pondering
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the QS project I wrote about before.  I started to expect that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things would crop up in my way to prevent my being able to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;complete the project, before it came to fruition.  It didn't
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(and it still doesn't) make sense to me that the measure of all
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my branches should be unaffected until the very instant that I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry out the experiment.  Because if the assumption that I'll
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be alive after the experiment date is correct, then I can expect
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to have memories at that time of somehow having escaped.  And
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should, in general, expect to have a memory of &quot;the most 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;likely&quot; escape route, or of one of the most likely ones, if there
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are several that are near-equally likely.  
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But how can one reconcile that with the concept of continuity of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness from moment to moment?  Only if there is a reverse
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;causality at work.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This theory has significant and testable implications.  Viz:  we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should expect to find ourselves in a universe that will allow us
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to live forever.  I.e.  this leads directly to the requirement 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the FAP is true.  Just consider if time t1 and t2 are 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;separated by a larger and larger time span.  Consider also that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those branches in which we cease to exist also tend to decrease
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the measure of all the observer-moments in previous subjective 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, the measure of our observer-moments at the next 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instant in subjective time are weighted as the number of continous
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paths from that observer-moment to the &quot;Omega-point&quot;.  This is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my crackpot theory.  Though it's certainly hard to justify on the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;basis of the SSA on a moment-by-moment basis (the Strong SSA), I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;haven't yet found anything that contradicts it.  I know that's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not good enough, but anyway I find it the most satisfying 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result of the above thought experiment.  All the other possibilities
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are problematic.
