Dear Henry, Charles and Peter,
<br />
<br />Apparently my messages did not go through to the FOR-LIST, I can  
<br />
understand because it could be slightly too technical for FOR. I let  
<br />
you know my comments, and send it in cc to the everything-list in case  
<br />
you want reply. We are used to discuss those matter there. Please  
<br />
don't reply personally because I try to limit the personal  
<br />
correspondences which force me to explain the same things to many  
<br />
people. Not only I have not the times, but it makes me forget what I  
<br />
say to who. Anyway, thanks for the interest.
<br />

<br />
<br />1) Post to Henry. The message got a new title-thread: Block-Mind (was:  
<br />
Free-will)

<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;How would an immaterial machine distinguish between a computation and

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;a material computation? What does matter add?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would think something has to *perform* the computation. For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, how can a computer program be executed without hardware?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />A computer program can be defined mathematically. And, like number (or  
<br />
tuple of numbers) can be associated with position in physics, computer  
<br />
program can be associated with number in computer science. Roughly  
<br />
speaking by their encodings.
<br />
A computer program execution can be defined mathematically too. Like a  
<br />
sequence of numbers, or a function, can be associated to movement in  
<br />
physics, a computer execution can be defined by a sequence of numbers,  
<br />
or an equivalence relation on the set of such sequences.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Have you a problem with the physicist notion of block universe, where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;time does not &quot;really&quot; exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No.
</em><br />
<br /><br />That is helpful. Now it is &quot;just a bit of technic&quot; to realize that a  
<br />
tiny part of arithmetic encodes all by itself a &quot;block-mind&quot;, once you  
<br />
assume the computationalist hypothesis. All the stopping and non  
<br />
stopping program executions are encoded in the arithmetical truth. So  
<br />
we can define an inside point of view by the relative execution of  
<br />
programs existing in arithmetic. It gives a multilayered complex  
<br />
structure.
<br />
Not attibuting mind to the entities appearing there, which look like  
<br />
you and me here and now, makes such complex structure full of zombies.
<br />
A priori there will be too much executions (the white rabbits).  
<br />
Perhaps even so much that the comp hyp would lead to a contradiction.  
<br />
Empirically, quantum mechanics entails also a class of quantum white  
<br />
rabbits or some quantum Harry Potter histories, but quantum mechanics  
<br />
does provide an explanation why those (quantum) rabbits are relatively  
<br />
very rare.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We don't need real space or time, because these are only abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions specifying the relation between physical/material objects.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the objects themselves are real, have to be real. For if they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not real, then we are left with nothing.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I think we are left with numbers' dreams. Third person realness  
<br />
*feelings* develops from or in bunches of very long histories, which  
<br />
are relatively so numerous and entangled that we can share them. No  
<br />
doubt we share a very long (cosmic) history. But, assuming the comp  
<br />
hyp, we have no ways to distinguish &quot;real&quot; from &quot;virtual&quot;, nor  
<br />
&quot;virtual&quot; from arithmetical. We cannot know if we are in a block-mind  
<br />
or a block-universe. (But they cannot both be computable)
<br />
The fact that we cannot make such a distinction is the result of the  
<br />
&quot;movie-graph&quot; argument. Latter Tim Maudlin has found independently an  
<br />
argument which shows basically the same thing, and put a serious doubt  
<br />
to the identity thesis in the computationalist philosophy of mind.
<br />
Note that the identity thesis is already in difficult position in most  
<br />
&quot;Everett-like interpretation&quot; of QM.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_(philosophy</a>) :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;In &lt;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy</a>&gt;philosophy, mechanism is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;a theory that all natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;phenomena can be explained by physical causes.
</em><br />
<br /><br />To be short I will say Wikipedia is wrong: the idea that all natural  
<br />
phenomena can be explained by physical laws is physicalism (or  
<br />
materialism, or naturalism. Not mechanism).
<br />
<br />Mechanism is an assumption in the philosophy of mind, or in cognitive  
<br />
science. It is the assumption that &quot;I&quot; am a machine. And digital  
<br />
mechanism (in the weak sense I am most of the time using)  is that my  
<br />
consciousness is &quot;Turing emulable&quot;. It means that my consciousness can  
<br />
be processed through a computer program execution.
<br />
For the reason above, the computer execution does not have to be real  
<br />
or virtual. It can be purely arithmetical. From the point of view of  
<br />
the program which is executed, there is no possible difference.  
<br />
Actually the program is &quot;statically&quot; executed almost everywhere in the  
<br />
block-mind structure.
<br />
<br />I am aware that mechanism is the usual theory of mind of the  
<br />
naturalist/physicalist. And indeed physicalism implies reasonably  
<br />
mechanism (unless you believe in the wave packet reduction or some  
<br />
other &quot;collective hallucinations&quot; (Feynman). This explains probably  
<br />
the confusion between mechanism and physicalism.
<br />
<br />But you better should not confuse them, because *digital* mechanism  
<br />
entails the falsity of physicalism. Or equivalently, physicalism  
<br />
entails the falsity of digital mechanism, or equivalently digital  
<br />
mechanism and physicalism are incompatible. By logic alone &quot;I&quot; or &quot;the  
<br />
universe&quot; cannot be completely described in term of a digital machine.
<br />
<br />This shows also that physicalism cannot really entails digital  
<br />
mechanism, without being inconsistent.
<br />
<br />I am not pretending at all that this is completely obvious. It *is* a  
<br />
bit work demanding of course.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So mechanism implies physical causes, which implies material. And yet
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you deny material. So it doesn't seem comp is a form of mechanism.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but digital mechanism implies only arithmetical causes (like 4  
<br />
divides n implies that 2 divides n).
<br />
Physical causes emerge in the mind of the arithmetical observers, in  
<br />
some sense.
<br />
This emergence is not a purely statistical emergence, but a mixture of  
<br />
statistical emergence (due to the first person (plural) indeterminacy  
<br />
bearing on the universal dovetailing or on any block-mind structure),  
<br />
and of an emergence from that &quot;block-mind structure&quot; which is  
<br />
constrained non trivially by computer science. See below for  
<br />
Mandelbrot Set videos. They are probable block-mind structure.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Everett Deutch Zurek explanation of bit (mind) from qubit (matter)  
<br />
remains correct, but if we take mechanism seriously enough we can see  
<br />
that such an explanation has a reverse, i.e. an explanation of qubit  
<br />
(matter) from bit (mind). But the reverse makes the explanation richer  
<br />
by &quot;explaining&quot; consciousness, &quot;free-will&quot;, &quot;infinities&quot; ... and this  
<br />
by the fact, that computer science can explain how and why universal  
<br />
machine can be &quot;aware&quot; of the presence of something they cannot be  
<br />
entirely aware of, and other things of that kind. This has been  
<br />
already well understood mathematically by Emil Post, Gödel at the very  
<br />
beginning (but he will forget later) and Judson Webb.  Thist is missed  
<br />
by Lucas and Penrose, for example. Universal Machine can prove their  
<br />
own incompleteness theorem. When consistent, it is easy  
<br />
(computationally) for them to infer correctly their intrinsical  
<br />
ignorance, indeterminacy, etc. For them universe(s) are first of all  
<br />
big unknown thing(s).
<br />
<br />This is an important FOR topics, imo, if a bit critical certainly, in  
<br />
the sense that it shows that David has not pushed the Turing thread as  
<br />
far as taking the comp hyp seriously *enough*. No physicists does  
<br />
that, actually, but David is the closer, well, after J.A. Wheeler.
<br />
Digitalism provides also an explanation why, if we look at ourselves  
<br />
close enough, we should have indirect evidence of many computations/ 
<br />
histories/worlds. Indeed, up to now, the comp hyp is still a priory  
<br />
too much many-wordly. But QM fits better than Newton in that regard.
<br />
<br />Digital Mechanism could be wrong, of course, but the &quot;easy white  
<br />
rabbit refutation&quot; is blocked by the non triviality of mathematical  
<br />
computer science. It is a priori too much many-wordly, but no more  
<br />
easily prove to be so.
<br />
<br />*I* could be wrong too, of course. That why I have submit this work as  
<br />
a thesis, or as papers, and although there are few people courageous  
<br />
enough to study such an extreme interdisciplinary subject, (which  
<br />
traverses cognitive science/philosophy of mind, physics, computer  
<br />
science, mathematical logic), those who have done so either get the  
<br />
point, or get the idea that it could be interesting to find precisely  
<br />
where an error could be.
<br />
<br />As a possible help for having some idea or image of the &quot;block-mind&quot;  
<br />
or Universal Deployment, and its non triviality, you could perhaps  
<br />
take a look on the Mandelbrot Set.
<br />
Penrose has conjectured that the Mandelbrot set in undecidable (in a  
<br />
sense close to Turing), and this has been proved by Blum, Smale and  
<br />
Shub. Well, much before Penrose I have made a stronger assumption  
<br />
which is that the Mandelbrot set is &quot;creative&quot; in the sense of Post.  
<br />
That means mainly &quot;Turing-Universal&quot;. I am still conjecturing this.   
<br />
If that is true, the Mandelbrot set would give a compact and connexe  
<br />
plane representation of the &quot;block-mind&quot;, or of the Universal  
<br />
Deployment.
<br />
So you could contemplate those beautiful movies below, bearing in mind  
<br />
they give only a third person view of the block-mind.
<br />
Unlike the Universe of Sets, or even the possible physical universe  
<br />
(in most current theories), the block-mind *does* contain itself or  
<br />
versions of itself, indeed with all possible variations.
<br />
You will see that this is indeed the case for the Mandelbrot Set.  
<br />
Indeed, the Mandelbrot Set contains itself everywhere. Note that each  
<br />
of the following are generated by a very simple program (mainly an  
<br />
interation of z := z^2 + C, for each C in the complex plane and  
<br />
deciding if it goes to infinity or not) + zooming on the result. The  
<br />
border of the set is infinitely intricate and &quot;complex&quot; (sorry for the  
<br />
pun). The color measures the quickness of the way you go to infinity  
<br />
in that iteration, and it measures in that way how close you are to  
<br />
the Mandelbrot set.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; give an example of how a physical process arises from integers? It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seems integers is just a list of numbers increasing 1 at a time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That's not very complicated. How do we get from something as simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as counting numbers to, say, the law of Gravity? Or a molecule? Your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; theory seems rather abstract, and it would be more helpful if your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; explanations were more specific. And how does the mere existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; numbers create reality? If I write 1, 2, 3, 4 etc. on a piece of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; paper, surely that doesn't create a reality? Again I come back the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the issue, there must be some kind of hardware, matter, physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; stuff, some sort of stuff, which actually *runs* the processes which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are hapening in reality?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I too would love to hear an answer to this. Of course I believe we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dealing with numbers so large that they couldn't even be written  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; down - even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a formula to generate them couldn't be, in fact. Perhaps those sorts  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers look like reality when seen from inside...?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say it is more due to the fact that little numbers can  
<br />
generate complex gigantic realities.
<br />
The big numbers are more in the generation steps than in the original  
<br />
seed. Stable realities should be filtered from inside.
<br />
Digitalness prevents the need of time, the digital notion of step (a  
<br />
cousin of the function n+1) is enough.
<br />
It is also more in the many relations between numbers than in the  
<br />
numbers themselves.
<br />
See my hopefully not too much lengthy answer to Henry. It is a  
<br />
delicate point.
