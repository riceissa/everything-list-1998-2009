</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I will feel to be at M, but I will never feel to be at both place at once.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I agree that *own* is a better term. But I still don't agree that I should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;either feel to be W or M. I believe I would still be the original. I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;been discussing this on this list for a while and did not yet see a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;convincing argument. In fact, I think the people in this list have various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different beliefs in this topic. Some say I should somehow expect to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both at the same time;
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />To be precise I have no certainty in that domain, except probably that
<br />
if we postulate explicitly that we are &quot;turing emulable&quot; (comp) then we can
<br />
prove that from a first person perspective we will feel to be at W, or at 
<br />
M, but
<br />
not at both place, neither at none place.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;some say personal identity does not exist at all,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which is quite nice to be said but hard to make a sense of (if you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not an enlightened buddhist or something);
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Indeed, I agree. To say personal identity does not exist at all has no
<br />
meaning except for a zombie (but from a zombie point of view the word
<br />
&quot;exists&quot;, &quot;pain&quot; &quot;matter&quot; ... has no meaning).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;and some, like you, believe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I should have equal subjective probabilities of being each.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The fact is that I am in a state of maximal ignorance before the experiment.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I don't see a justification for this beyond personal taste. I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I must have lost this argument earlier on this list, but could you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;refer me to a more complete argument, or give a description of it here?
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, I try here (more reference below)
<br />
Remember that we accept the comp hyp as a working hypothesis. Note that
<br />
this is apparently original: in the literature talk about comp is always
<br />
directed toward a refutation or a defense of comp. I don't care becuase my
<br />
point is that ONCE we postulate comp, then we get that comp first person
<br />
indeterminacy, and eventually the complete reversal between physics and
<br />
&quot;machine psychology&quot; (physics being redefined as what is really invariant
<br />
in all consistent extension of the universal turing machine...).
<br />
<br />So a computationalist is someone who says yes for using teleportation
<br />
(classical teleportation) where he is scanned and read at the correct level
<br />
(which exists by comp), then he is annihilated at D (departure city)
<br />
(under anesthesia if you prefer)
<br />
then he is reconstituted at some place.
<br />
Now suppose he is reconstituted at two different places, W and M to fix the 
<br />
things.
<br />
(D is different from W, which is different from M, he is still annihilated at
<br />
D).
<br />
<br />At each of those two places we can imagine he is reconstituted in some
<br />
closed box, and that he will localized himself by using a GPS system, and 
<br />
will note
<br />
the result in his notebook. OK?
<br />
Now, with comp, the one in M will localized himself at M and write M in the 
<br />
notebook,
<br />
and the one in W will localized himself  at W and note W in the notebook.
<br />
SO, If we ask before the experiment to a candidate where he will find himself
<br />
after the annihilation (! what he will note in the notebook) then
<br />
<br /><br />1) He cannot say &quot;I will be at none places&quot;, because he believes comp, so he
<br />
believes he survives teleportation (and the duplication does not change 
<br />
anything
<br />
because the two copies are supposed to be computationaly independent).
<br />
<br />2) He cannot say &quot; I will be at the two places&quot; because by the definition of
<br />
first person (which is just (at this stage) the content of memory/notebook), he
<br />
knows that each notebook will contained a note like &quot;the GPS result = W&quot; or
<br />
&quot;the GPS result = M&quot; and no notebooks will contained &quot;the GPS result =
<br />
W and M&quot;.
<br />
<br />3) He cannot say &quot;I will be for sure at W&quot; because, by comp (unless putting W
<br />
in the definition of his brain, but then choose other cities for the 
<br />
experiment),
<br />
both reconstitution are 100% (numerically) symmetrical.
<br />
<br /><br />4) Nor can He say &quot; I will be for sure at M&quot;, for the same reason.
<br />
<br />My feeling, if I remember correctly some of your post is that you
<br />
will, say 1), that is &quot;I will be at none places&quot;, because (and tell me please
<br />
if I guess it correctly) you will say &quot;I remain the original which has been
<br />
destroyed at D&quot;. I have no problem with that. It means you disagree right
<br />
at the start with the comp hyp.
<br />
There is a problem only if you believe in comp (mainly that you are turing
<br />
emulable) and still disbelieve with the comp first person indeterminacy.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />If you want to know why comp eventually force us to derive the laws
<br />
of physics, perhaps the &quot;simplest&quot; exposition are the following
