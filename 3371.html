<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in your post - I do not even know where to start. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />Rhetorical tricks, if not insult as usual :(
<br />
Have you read  <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3241.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3241.html</a>
<br />
<br />Well, G* tells me to remain mute here, but then I don't care.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[...]
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You can be a GP. Write a program that computes all universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computable in the limit. Add storage in case of storage overflow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Still, you as a GP have a resource problem. At some point it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get harder and harder for you to keep computing all the things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you'd like to compute.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you using the GP as an analogy or what? What is exactly
<br />
your ontology? You have not answered my question: How could the
<br />
GP have resource problems? Is not resource a notion internal to
<br />
some universe, and are not universe generated by the GP.
<br />
You are presupposing physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just like I cannot say much about the environment of the particular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;GP who programmed us.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Are you really serious? Are you believing we have a GP in a universe?
<br />
Where does the universe of our GP comes from?
<br />
This is tortoise build on tortoises. Even infinite tortoises
<br />
sequences embedded in a physical universe. That explains nothing.
<br />
<br />I knew you have not yet understand
<br />
the comp reversal physico/psycho, but you have not even seen
<br />
the reversal physico/computer-science, or what?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Again: forget all the esoteric undecidability stuff, which does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really matter here, and be pragmatic and try to look at things from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perspective of some observer being computed as part of a virtual reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you programmed. The observer may get smart and correctly suspect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you have a resource problem, and can make nontrivial predictions from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there, using the Speed Prior.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are still postulating what I am searching an explanation for.
<br />
I am not (necessarily) pragmatic in advance. A concrete virtual reality
<br />
on earth inherits the &quot;normality&quot; of the world in which
<br />
it is embedded. I pretend that comp force us to justify that
<br />
normality. It is not obvious that that is possible.
<br />
But the UDA forces to take all computations into account, and 
<br />
undecidability stuff is unavoidable, if only because we can only *bet*
<br />
on our consistent extentions (In the translation of the UDA into
<br />
arithmetic, consistent extension have the unprovable type &quot;&lt;&gt;p&quot;).
<br />
<br />Incompleteness phenomena put fundamental constraints for a TOE.
<br />
You could call them logical and arithmetical priors.
<br />
<br />But you don't seem searching a toe, just a recipe for
<br />
predicting some granted neighborhood.
<br />
<br />The arithmetical UD is just the set of \Sigma 1 sentences.
<br />
Resource must be explained from it, not the inverse.
<br />
<br />I am not sure a TOE can be pragmatic. Like
<br />
quantum mechanics is not useful for cooking.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No, that's exactly where the Speed Prior comes in. Accoring to this prior, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the slow programs computing the same thing contribute less to its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability mass. It is explained in the chapter on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Speed Prior-Based Inductive Inference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node32.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/toesv2/node32.html</a>
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't need to read it because it is in contradiction with the
<br />
&quot;invariance lemma&quot;, in particular by the fact that from a first
<br />
person point of view the delays (between the many acces by the UD 
<br />
of near computational states) does not matter.
<br />
(BTW I have read it, and we discussed it before). 
<br />
<br />You know the GP will generate itself, but will generate also less and 
<br />
less efficient version of itself. From the first person point of view 
<br />
they 
<br />
are indistinguishable. Are you telling me that the Juergen and Bruno
<br />
appearing in those very slow GPs are zombie?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is indeed hard to write a little program which generate a long
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Kolmogorov-Chaitin incompressible 01 string.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But, as I told you earlier, it is quite easy to write a little
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; program which generates them all. (It is the essence of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everything idea imo).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As you told me earlier? Huh? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's one of the points of the 1997 book chapter.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I was meaning &quot;As I recall you earlier in some recent post&quot;!
<br />
(but look at my 1988 Toulouse paper ;-)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The thing is: when you generate them all, and assume that all are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;equally likely, in the sense that all beginnings of all strings are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uniformly distributed, then you cannot explain why the regular universes 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;keep being regular.  The random futures are then just as likely as the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nonrandom ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So you NEED something additional to explain the ongoing regularity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You need something like the Speed Prior, which greatly favors regular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;futures over others.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You speak like if I were proposing the iterated duplication as 
<br />
a universal explanation. It is only an illustration of the comp 
<br />
indeterminism. With comp it is the whole work of the UD, UD*, which
<br />
constitutes the domain of indeterminism. The self-multiplication 
<br />
experience
<br />
just show how a 3 deterministic process consistent with comp explains
<br />
a phenomenology of (in the limit) sort of absolute randomnes.
<br />
The &quot;real&quot; experience is the infinite running of the UD. And that running
<br />
is embedded in the arithmetical truth, for exemple under the form of
<br />
\Sigma_1 sentences.
<br />
UD* generalises both QM and &quot;the iterated self duplication&quot; experiences.
<br />
The unawareness of delays forces us to take into account an infinite set
<br />
of infinite histories (like in Feynman formulation of QM).
<br />
<br />Some internal (modal) interpretation are given by the logic of
<br />
what consistent machine can prove. Have you follow my post with George
<br />
Levy on Modal Logic?
<br />
<br />Have you follow the recent version of the UDA in 11 steps, I have
<br />
proposed to Joel Dobrzelewski see links: 
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3044.html</a>
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;But don't you see? Why does a particular agent, say, yourself, with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nonrandom past, have a nonrandom future? Why is your computer still there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;after one second, although in a truly random world it would immediately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dissolve? Why do pencils keep falling down instead of up, when the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;futures where they fall up are just as likely?
</em><br />
<br /><br />We &quot;practice&quot; iterated duplications all the time only below our
<br />
sharable level of substitution. (like in Everett). This is plausible.
<br />
UD* structure is highly non trivial especially from the point of view
<br />
of consistent machine &quot;surviving&quot; on their
<br />
consistent extensions which are *sparsed* among UD*.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To repeat, the concept of the machine that computes all universe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories is NOT by itself sufficient to explain why our future stays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regular. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />But the concept of the machine that executes all programs is NOT
<br />
intended to explain why our future stays regular. It is the unavoidable
<br />
reality for machines from their provable and consistent point of view.
<br />
To add any priors is just sort of treachery with comp.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The additional concept of the Speed Prior explains it though.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would like to believe you but you don't even adress the problems
<br />
which interest me like the link between 1 and 3 person discourse, the
<br />
extraction of the quantum from a measure on the whole UD*, etc. 
<br />
<br />I don't see how you attach mind to a single computation.
<br />
You are using a naive theory of mind which is inconsistent with
<br />
both comp and QM at once.
<br />
<br />I am agnostic about the little program, although the UD*-measure,
<br />
*if* computable (which I doubt) would define it. 
<br />
<br />My main question to you is &quot;how does the speed prior filters out 
<br />
the many possible slow similar history generated
<br />
by the GP, given that we cannot distinguish them, and we cannot be
<br />
aware of which one we belong here and then.
<br />
<br />Do you know the logic of provability and quantum logic? Have you
<br />
follow <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2855.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m2855.html</a> and the
<br />
posts leading to? (some mathematician prefer to consider the
<br />
UDA only as a motivation for that result).
<br />
<br />The more urgent, if you want to refute my approach, is to show me
<br />
where I am wrong in the UDA.
<br />
<br />I repeat I don't refute your approach. It surely lacks motivation
<br />
(especially) your second paper, but with comp it is hardly complete. 
<br />
You dismiss 100% of the mind body problem.
<br />
I am not astonished, it is a widespread disease since Aristotle.
<br />
<br />Another problem with your approach is that it is inconsistent
<br />
with quantum mechanics. As you know. 
<br />
Mine is consistent with QM and even entails some of it and 
<br />
(normally) all of it (less possible geographical peculiarities).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I do not understand. But please do _not_ elaborate.
</em><br />
<br /><br />How am I suppose to interpret that. Well, I know you believe in
<br />
(and are using) a one-one mind-body/computation relation, but this
<br />
has been shown inconsistent with comp (Marchal 88, Maudlin 89,
<br />
reference are in my thesis URL below).
<br />
<br />So you should still explain us how you attach mind to single
<br />
computations, but this will contradict the invariance lemma,
<br />
so I'm skeptical. This does not mean the prior approach has not
<br />
some intrinsical interest. Your critics are to poor for
<br />
helping to see if our approaches are compatible or not.
<br />
In a older post I conjecture your approach is reductible to mine
<br />
in the case of comp with a sort of infinitely low level of 
<br />
substitution. This could perhaps help singularising relevant
<br />
computations. But with your unfair remarks I realise I am not
<br />
even sure you read my post and that I'm probably wasting my time.
