</em><br />
<br />I think the difference (and confusion on my part) arises from the fact
<br />
that you are not using the measure suggested by Schmidhuber. Instead you
<br />
are looking at all infinite computations and 'peek' into the state of
<br />
the machine. And I agree this will probably give an additional shift
<br />
towards 'large' numbers and concepts involving limits towards infinity,
<br />
like the reals. And perhaps it's not a bad idea. It is, after all, a
<br />
larger set than the set of turing machines that come to a halt - i.e.
<br />
all halting turing-machines can be implemented by your set by simply
<br />
adding an 'infinite loop' at the end, so to say.
<br />
<br />So, how is that measure defined? One shot at a semi-formal definition
<br />
would perhaps be something like this;
<br />
O(p,i)=The i:th string the program p chooses to expose.
<br />
I~(O)=An interpretation of O.
<br />
I(p)=lim( I~(O(p,i)), i-&gt;inf )
<br />
M(I´,N)=(number of programs p of length N whose I(p)=I´ ) / 3^N
<br />
M(I´)=lim( M(I´,N), N-&gt;inf )
<br />
Or do you have a better suggestion? (Note that this definition gets rid
<br />
of 'internal' UD:s since they don't have an interpretation in the limit)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(BTW do you believe that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Planck constant is compressible ?).
</em><br />
<br />Uhh... It's not dimensionless, is it? So, um... I think it's 1 :-).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, personaly, I will never presume a linear differential 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equation: that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is really what I try to derive from more reasonable 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hypothesis like comp.
</em><br />
<br />Well, that was a mistake on my part that I tried to correct in a
<br />
followup; I didn't actually mean 'linear differential equation'.
<br />
But I did make an assumption. And I frequently do just to see what
<br />
happens, even though I don't even believe these assumptions to be true.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arithmetical truth, as the 'Schmidhuber plenitude' is not enough as an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation. The explanation will come with the adequacy between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different type of discourse possible by the 'average' 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Self-Referentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Correct Universal Turing machine and our own experience. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I propose and illustrate ways for making this mathematicaly precise in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>.
</em><br />
<br />Unfortunately I don't understand a word of french :-(.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can see in the archive that although I agree with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber's (and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even has invoked it by myself) computationalist plenitude, I disagree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a lot with Schmidhuber conclusion in his paper.
</em><br />
<br />Oh, I too disagree with a number of things. The explanation, or even
<br />
description, of Everett's relative state interpretation comes to mind.
<br />
And, btw, I can't really say that I agree with the computationalist
<br />
plenitude either - I'm merely toying with the idea. (If someone pressed
<br />
me, I would admit that I think that our universe can probably be
<br />
simulated by a turing-machine and that consciousness could arise, but
<br />
I'm not sure we can make any/correct predictions)
<br />
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;NT: Whereas these infinite computations more or less assert an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;absolute time.
</em><br />
&lt;snip&gt;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Third person physical time and first person subjective time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modalities (infered by machines entangled with deep 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations, ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They have nothing to do with the 'time step' of the DU. In my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'ultimate 
</em><br />
<br />Heh, no, I didn't think so. And I feel that I somewhat unjustly accused
<br />
you. Perhaps I should have accused Schmidhuber instead, whose first
<br />
assumption of his paper is &quot;Each universe evolves on a discrete time
<br />
scale&quot;. I also feel that the concept of MWI splitting promotes this
<br />
picture (and should therefore be banned :-).
<br />
Personally, I could just as well look at the universe as 'evolving in
<br />
the x-direction'. Or, simply, looking at e.g. the Maxwell equation, that
<br />
the program has a 4-dimensional array that is successively expanded and
<br />
refined to reach an infinite extent and infinite resolution in the
<br />
limit.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
