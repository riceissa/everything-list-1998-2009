<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them either a good or bad experience.  These are not replays, they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;new experiences which we can accurately anticipate will be pleasant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or unpleasant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose we are going to flip a biased quantum coin, one which has a 90%
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chance of coming up heads.  We will generate the good or bad experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;depending on the outcome of the coin flip.  I claim that it is obvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that it is better to give the good experience when we get the 90% outcome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the bad experience when we get the 10% outcome.  That's the assumption
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will start with.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now consider Tegmark's level 1 of parallelism, the fact that in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sufficiently large volume of space I can find a large number of copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of me, in fact copies of the entire earth and our entire visible universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(the &quot;Hubble bubble&quot;?).  When I do my quantum coin flip, 90% of the copies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will see it come up heads and cause the good experience for the subject,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and 10% will see tails and cause the bad experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I will also assume that my knowledge of this fact about the physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe will not change my mind about the ethical value of my decision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to give the good experience for the 90% outcome.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now the problem is this.  There are really only two different programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being run for our experimental subject, the guy in the simulation.  One is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a good experience and one is bad.  All my decision does is to change how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;many copies of each of these two programs are run.  In making my decision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about which experiences to assign to the two coin flip outcomes, I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chosen that the copies of the good experience will outnumber copies of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the bad experience by 9 to 1.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But if I don't believe that the number of copies being run makes a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difference, then I haven't accomplished what I desired.  The fact that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am running more copies of the good program than the bad wouldn't make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any difference.  Therefore there is no actual ethical value in what I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have done, I might have just as validly reversed the outcome of my coin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flips and it wouldn't have made any difference.
</em><br />
<br />Here is another way of explaining this situation. When there are multiple 
<br />
parallel copies of you, you have no way of knowing which copy you are, 
<br />
although you definitely are one of the copies during any given moment, with 
<br />
no telepathic links with the others or anything like that. If a proportion 
<br />
of the copies are painlessly killed, you notice nothing, because your 
<br />
successor OM will be provided by one of the copies still going (after all, 
<br />
this is what happens in the case of teleportation). Similarly, if the number 
<br />
of copies increases, you notice nothing, because during any given moment you 
<br />
are definitely only one of the copies, even if you don't know which one. 
<br />
However, if your quantum coin flip causes 90% of the copies to have bad 
<br />
experiences, you *will* notice something: given that it is impossible to 
<br />
know which particular copy you are at any moment, or which you will be the 
<br />
next moment, then there is a 90% chance that you will be one of those who 
<br />
has the bad experience. Similarly, if you multiply the number of copies 
<br />
tenfold, and give all the &quot;new&quot; copies bad experiences, then even though the 
<br />
&quot;old&quot; copies are left alone, you will still have a 90% chance of a bad 
<br />
experience, because it is impossible to know which copy will provide your 
<br />
next OM.
<br />
<br />So, perhaps counterintuitively, you and all your copies are better off if 
<br />
all but one is painlessly killed than if the total number is increased and a 
<br />
proportion of the new copies given a bad experience.
<br />
This is what I was trying to show in my post &quot;another puzzle&quot;. I think this 
<br />
way of looking at it is simple, consistent, does not require any new 
<br />
physical laws, and provides a reason to do good things rather than bad 
<br />
things in the multiverse, as long as you don't make the terrible mistake of 
<br />
assuming that the absolute measure of copies with good experiences is more 
<br />
important than the relative measure.
