Hi
<br />
Been lurking a few weeks, feeling a little overwhelmed by how much more
<br />
everyone seems educated on the topic than I've managed to absorb through
<br />
my own casual readings. Internet geek, psychonaut from South Africa, no
<br />
formal education. :-)
<br />
(Apologies for length - so much I want to cover)

</em><br />
<br />Yes it may be more than an input valve in the sense that it's an
<br />
information processing organ, but it's still largely just an automation
<br />
organ governed by rules, filters and prior knowledge (genetic or learned
<br />
through bumps on the head as we stumble). A key factor here is the
<br />
automation element. I don't have the references at hand (but it's
<br />
available online) in which some researchers (well one in particular
<br />
whose name escapes me) theorises that as humans we are 99.999%
<br />
automation, with the only real stream of conscious thought being the
<br />
0.001% clean slate we start off with if you take away the predisposed
<br />
starting conditions of genetics and nurture.
<br />
<br />My point may not be directly relevant to the thread, but it's useful to
<br />
remember in the context of the simulation argument. It's much easier to
<br />
code an automated system (even a self-learning one) than it is to code
<br />
conscious thought. Given enough processing power and computational
<br />
cycles, it's possible to accept that the output may so closely resemble
<br />
conscious thought that it can be defined as such, even if it's only a
<br />
self-evident to the program itself (i.e. as a starting condition, when X
<br />
= Y, consider self as Z(en) :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But that is merely predisposed grow pattern.
</em><br />
<br />There is an interesting paradox here though. While we could write off
<br />
everything we think/do/feel as merely iterations of an existing
<br />
predisposed grow pattern, and that all external input in addition to the
<br />
predisposed grow pattern as the same process occuring to external
<br />
things, we are still faced with the perception (illusion?) that we are
<br />
conscious and that we can influence the direction in which our lives
<br />
move forward (or consciously adjust our pattern matching techniques to
<br />
better suit survival)
<br />
<br />Then there is the added element of randomness or perhaps entropy ...
<br />
even in a 100% controlled simulation experiment, with every possible
<br />
starting condition being accounted for, something new can still enter
<br />
the equation. In turn this leads to more knowledge about starting
<br />
conditions, which affects the next simulation, which in turn gives rise
<br />
to a new random element.
<br />
<br />What is this random element exactly? I don't know (besides unlearned
<br />
knowledge). Seems like the more we learn about the universe, the more
<br />
questions we don't have answers for. In this sense, an infinite number
<br />
of simulation programs only serve as a filter for discovering a more
<br />
complete set of starting conditions for each iteration. (Assuming you
<br />
have an existing 'reality' to compare the simulations to).
<br />
<br />Anyway, my point is that any predisposed grow pattern is just a filter
<br />
technique for finding out what has been missed from the initial starting
<br />
conditions, even if the predisposed grow pattern is an entirely random
<br />
biological process. (life continues even if the organisms don't)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but this is where you get a smart
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; galaxy. it can learn to filter out what it feels it does not need to PAY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ATTENTION TO.
</em><br />
<br />It's much harder to consiously learn filteration patterns than it is to
<br />
unconciously learn them. Just observe any child growing up - they take
<br />
on more of their parents behavioral patterns through unconcious
<br />
behavioral duplication than anything else. (Kinda in direct opposite to
<br />
&quot;Do as I say, not as I do&quot;)
<br />
<br />The fact that an organ can replicate the filtration processes of other
<br />
organs in it's sphere of influence does not mean it's smart. Parrots can
<br />
fool people into thinking they're conscious of the meaning of the words
<br />
they replicate, but they're not much smarter than any animal that
<br />
realises it can have an easy ride to food and protection. I'd say that's
<br />
more instinct than 'smart'. Ditto for humans. Instinctively we replicate
<br />
the behavioral patterns and learnings of the other humans within our
<br />
sphere of influence because if we don't - we get rejected (or in some
<br />
cases killed) because we don't resemble our family/tribe/community
<br />
closely enough.
<br />
<br />(You want cultural diversity - come to South Africa - no matter how PC
<br />
you may feel you are, integration is a massively difficult task for any
<br />
species, even within the species itself. Even a conscious attempt
<br />
demonstrates just how preconcieved our thinking patterns really are)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We code our memory by the continious rearangement of pathways.
</em><br />
<br />This is an entirely unconscious process, born of millions of years of
<br />
accidental combinations of chemicals and environment. Working just on a
<br />
sort of game theory principle, even the most simple of single celled
<br />
organisms would find it beneficial to colocate as a multicellular
<br />
organism for the simple purpose of reducing the number of functions each
<br />
single cell needs to do. In the same fashion, the re-arrangement of
<br />
pathways in the brain may just be the most effective survival pattern
<br />
for the individual cells themselves, with the survival of the overall
<br />
mass (within a larger biological sphere) just being a useful extra
<br />
occurence. But then I'm guessing here - my biology knowledge is sorely
<br />
lacking :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would have to develop a way for the brain to learn to accept and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digest incoming brain knowlegde.
</em><br />
<br />That's easy - just bombard it knowledge. In response it does one of two
<br />
things: filters the bombardment out, or recognises existing patterns in
<br />
that bombardment. The ability to recognise apparently new patterns may
<br />
just be a combination of conditions allowing for a very old pattern to
<br />
be re-recognised as a new one.
<br />
<br />Or to look at it another way, all possible patterns can be recognised,
<br />
but only at the relevant time in which they are meaningful.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean, our brain has evolved to the point to where it is now, and it has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; learned to coded certain things certain ways now BY INSTINCT....
</em><br />
<br />I wouldn't say it's learnt to code to the point that coding can be done
<br />
instinctively. I'd argue that instinct pre-exists the code itself. I
<br />
don't buy into higher being arguments, but I do find the existence of
<br />
life in all it's forms to be very interesting, even though subsets of
<br />
those forms exist for incredibly short instances compared to the whole.
<br />
I'd argue that given any number of starting conditions, there would be
<br />
an instinctive development process from unorganised matter into
<br />
organised matter, into complex organised matter, into still more complex
<br />
organised matter, while at the same time there is a process of
<br />
deconstructing organised matter in all it's forms. Something causes
<br />
matter to come together, and something governs the decay of whatever
<br />
comes together. It's the level of complextity that can be reached that
<br />
is governed by starting conditions, not whether complexity itself will
<br />
exist or not. (imho)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; but what if we could use our actual processing ability, to realize the
</em><br />
next
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step in eveolution, and train our brains to make the change itself?...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only reason why were aren't doing it, is because we aren't forced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to. If we can find it. then offer the brain a route to form around it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who knows what could happen...
</em><br />
<br />Here's the most obvious example to me (and perhaps a tad eccentric too):
<br />
Let's take  look at our own reproductive cycle. Firstly we have a rather
<br />
long and uncomfortable gestation cycle which only sex has to endure.
<br />
Secondly, the birthing process itself is painful for both the mother and
<br />
child. Thirdly, it's only in fairly years that the men have been
<br />
participants in the actual birth process. Can you imagine stone age man
<br />
watching a women give birth? Screaming and shouting, bleeding, and then
<br />
something emerges from within her? They'd be picking up stones and clubs
<br />
and beating both the women and child to death. (Mind you even today I'm
<br />
sure that sort of reaction is instinctive to many males even if they've
<br />
been trained to be willing participants)
<br />
<br />So, in all our years of 'conscious' thought and the comfortable
<br />
illusions of free will, why haven't the males adjusted their genetic
<br />
input in the procreation process to make allowance for bigger birthing
<br />
canals, and less painful births?[1] It's not that easy some may say - we
<br />
can't consciously choose the genetic changes of our own evolution - but
<br />
isn't that exactly what we do when we 'choose' a mate? That one is
<br />
suitable while that one is not ...
<br />
<br />If we can so successfully convince ourselves that we can 'choose' then
<br />
why aren't doing so on a deeper level? Either the perception of choice
<br />
is an illusion, with every choice just being the reaction to a prior
<br />
actions, leading back to initial starting conditions, or choice is
<br />
something that only exists in non biological space. i.e. seperation of
<br />
mind and body, with mindspace being an interesting yet largely
<br />
irrelevant bonus.

<br />
on the fragile male ego larger birthing canals may have *grin*
