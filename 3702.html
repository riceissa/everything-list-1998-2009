Good idea Wai!
<br />
<br />Here are a few words describing my background. 
<br />
<br />I graduated from McGill University in Montreal with a master degree in
<br />
Electronic Engineering in 1968. My career has spanned many different
<br />
fields including electronic hardware design, CPU design, embedded
<br />
processors, software design, Kalman filtering and navigation, artificial
<br />
intelligence, smart automous vehicles for military air or ground
<br />
applications. More lately I invented a dedicated processor for
<br />
performing genome analysis. 
<br />
Since 1992 I have been working for myself, initially because of the
<br />
downturn in the economy due to the end of the cold war, and now because
<br />
of my age - age is as detrimental to engineers in the eyes of human
<br />
resources managers as it is to women in a beauty contest. Now I have my
<br />
own research and development company Quantics, which, at times, is
<br />
making money and at other times, struggling, depending on the contracts.
<br />
It's nice to have a loving and comprehending wife with a solid
<br />
profession during the hard times.
<br />
In the course of my work I have come up with many new patentable idea,
<br />
some of which generated money. 
<br />
Because of the nature of my work, I find that I must be very familar
<br />
with the patenting process. For years, I have been filing my own
<br />
patents. However, I am finding that marketing is much tougher than
<br />
inventing. I am well on my way to become a patent agent and soon it
<br />
shall be possible for me to do like Albert and work in a patent office
<br />
or work for myself as a patent agent.
<br />
I have always been interested in philosophy and physics. The idea of
<br />
Quantum immortality came to me independently around 1990 after some
<br />
meditation about Schroedinger's cat.  I started writing a book on the
<br />
matter. In the course of my research on that book, I came across the
<br />
everything list, David Deutsh and and Tegmark's idea.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find that I often have trouble understanding posts on this mailing list,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given the wide range of intellectual ground that it covers. It seems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; people sometimes assume a background in an academic field, and I'm not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even sure what the field is, or how to get up to date or at least familiar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with it. On the other hand, sometimes a poster is just a crank and isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making any sense at all. It can be hard to tell the difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps it would help if list members each posts a short biography of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves, and tell us their intellectual backgrounds. What fields are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you familiar with, what relevant books/papers have you read, etc.? This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way, if you don't understand someone's post, you can look up his JOINING
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; post in the archive and figure out what background he is assuming. I got
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this idea from the SL4 mailing list; maybe it will work here as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To begin with myself, I work as a cryptographic engineer, which means I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; design and implement computer security mechanisms, with a focus on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cryptographic parts. I have a BA in computer science, and have taken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; courses in linguistics, theory of computation, number theory, algebra,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability theory, and game theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I first encountered the idea that all possible universes exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the novel _Permutation City_ by Greg Egan, and then in Tegmark and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Schmidhuber's papers. I started this mailing list after reading both of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those papers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've scanned through _An Introduction to Kolmogorov Complexity and Its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Applications_, Ming Li and Paul Vitanyi, and read parts of it in enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; detail to have found several previously unreported errors. It's about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithmic information theory, and I personally think it is the single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most important book for list members to read.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here are some other books that I've read outside of formal education that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem relevant.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _The Selfish Gene_, Richard Dawkins. Theory of evolution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _Gödel, Escher, Bach - an Eternal Golden Braid_, Douglas Hofstadter. On
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-reference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _Maxwell's Demon: Entropy, Information, Computation_. Entropy and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics of computation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _Philosophy of Mathematics: Structure and Ontology_, Stewart Shapiro.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm finding that I don't have enough knowledge about foundations of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics, foundations of decision theory, and quantum mechanics. I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; currently reading the following books to rectify the situation:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _The Foundations of Causal Decision Theory_, James Joyce
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _A Modern Approach to Quantum Mechanics_, John S. Townsend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _Foundations Without Foundationalism : A Case for Second-Order Logic_,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stewart Shapiro
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ok, who wants to go next?
