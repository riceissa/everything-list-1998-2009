Thanks Ron, for the teaching in particular particles. Allow me to interspace some naive remarks into your text

&nbsp;&nbsp;[RMcF]:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Greetings, John. Over the decades I've waffled a lot on that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;very question. I currently do not believe that any type of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;gravity force carrier exists, and it is an attempt to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;explain the (seemingly verified by observation of supernova)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;accelerating expansion of the universe that tilts me in that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;direction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[JM]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Agree, but it is a great idea and many awards, tenures, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;prixes were accelerated with it. Hubble was a genius, just 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;did not consider other (less plausible?) explanations for the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;redshift than the fashionable optical Dopler.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;So you don't believe the 'real', only the 'virtual' which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;shows appreciation in imgination. (Read on)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[RMcF]:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do believe in the existence of virtual particles, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I further believe that our entire universe is a rather
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;improbable but possible collection of virtual particles.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I think there might be 2 entirely different
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;classes of virtual particles. One type is seen as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;particle/anti-particle pairs. The other type has no anti-
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;particle pair, and the first type of virtual particles along
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;with all the matter in our universe is composed of it. I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;think of this second type of virtual particles to be a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;localized (meaning the spheroid and non infinite but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;expanding boundaries of our entire universe) energy
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fluxation against a truly infinite area that is on the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;average composed of 100% nothingness. That fluxation I think...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[JM]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you just &quot;think&quot; about 100% nothingness, it disappears: by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;thinking of it you imply the information of such and that makes 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;it already into &quot;somethingness&quot; .
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[JMcF]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of as being something not at all related to nothingness, I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;think of it as being completely separate and not sharing any
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;properties of nothingness. Nonetheless, I think of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fluxation as being exactly that - a fluxation that seeks to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ultimately return a localized area of (on the average) 100%
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;nothingness back to its average energy density of exactly
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;zero. I think that gravity is that `seeking' phenomenon, the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;universal `desire' to return to an equilibrium condition of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;zero energy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[JM]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Zero energy could not start anything, a universe has got to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;get started. Do you assign that to &quot;outside&quot; factors only?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or - as seen below - a nihilistic solipsism?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[RMcF]:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Through some more convoluted thinking, I think of space/time
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;and matter/energy as being `universally localized'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;expressions of that `seeking' phenomenon, i.e. what is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;measurable within the spheroid volume that we call our
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;universe. I also think that the `seeking' phenomenon, not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;being particle based, is a true analog phenomenon and thus
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;not describable by QM; it is a separate thing expressed as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;space/time coexisting with an ultimately temporary condition
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;known as matter/energy. My thoughts are that space/time and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;matter/energy, these 2 things, are not at all related to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;each other and that they are what we can `locally' measure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;For lack of a better word, I've thought of that `seeking'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;phenomenon as a sort of tension that is not a force nor is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;it energy. Weirdly, I think that our universe exists and is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;only measurable within its own framework against something
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we call space/time, but that on the average and in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;context of infinity it never really existed, because an
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;equilibrium of 100% nothingness exists on the average. That
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;thought is quite difficult to fully explain.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;And I've certainly been wrong before!
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;But the thought of virtual particles appearing and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;disappearing (and so on the average never having existed)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;affecting upon our universe is also quite difficult to fully
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;explain. Perhaps one must conceptualize outside the boundary
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of our universe in order to explain our universe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;[JM]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I conceptualize 'my' multiverse as fluctuations of inevitable 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;stress-seeds in a Plentiude of Everything in total dynamic 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;exchange, an infinite symmetry where the completeness of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;diversity produces violations of the invariance = BigBangs, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. fluctuations into universes which re-dissipate into the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;symmetry in a timeless manner. This is outside the boundaries 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of our universe. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The  dissipating &quot;stress-seeds&quot;, however,, are called 'energy' 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the reductionist physics. So I disagree with your zero-energy 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;startup and only the endup is such when &quot;universe&quot; also 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;disappears in the Plenitude.
