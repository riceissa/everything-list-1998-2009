<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SP: ' In the end, what is &quot;right&quot; is an irreducible personal belief, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which you can try to change by appeal to emotions or by example, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not by appeal to logic or empirical facts. And in fact I feel much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; safer that way: if someone honestly believed that he knew what was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;right&quot; as surely as he knew 2+2=4, he would be a very dangerous 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; person. Religious fanatics are not dangerous because they want to do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; evil, but because they want to do good. '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: I agree with this, saving only that, on a 'numbers' basis, there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are those whose personal evolution takes them beyond the dynamic of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'good' or 'evil' into the domain of power for its own sake. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; entails complete loss of empathic ability and I think it could be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; argued that such a person is 'legislating' himself out of the human 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; species.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: I think a key point with 'irreducible personal belief' is that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the persons in question need to acknowledge the beliefs as such and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take responsibility for them. I believe we have to point this out, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whenever we get the opportunity, because generally most people are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; reluctant to engage in analysis of their own beliefs, in public 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; anyway. I think part of the reason for this is the cultural climate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [meme-scape?] in which Belief in a G/god/s or uncritical Faith are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; still held to be perfectly respectable. This cultural climate is what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Richard Dawkins and Daniel Dennet have been criticising in recent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; books and articles.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; SP: 'I am not entirely convinced that comp is true'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: At the moment I am satisfied that 'comp' is NOT true, certainly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; in any format that asserts that 'integers' are all that is needed. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'Quantum' is one thing, but 'digital' is quite another :-) The main 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; problem [fact I would prefer to say] is that existence is irreducible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whereas numbers or Number be dependent upon something/s existing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have fallen into sometimes using the term &quot;comp&quot; as short for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;computationalism&quot; as something picked up from Bruno. On the face of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it, computationalism seems quite sensible: the best theory of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and the most promising candidate for producing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artificial intelligence/consciousness (if they are the same thing: see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; below). Assuming comp, Bruno goes through 8 steps in his Universal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dovetailer Argument (UDA), eg. in this paper:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.htm</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All of the steps are relatively straightforward until step 8,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am glad to hear that.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; which invokes an argument discovered by Bruno and Tim Maudlin 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; demonstrating that there is a problem with the theory that the mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supervenes on the physical. It seems that to be consistent you have to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow either that any computation, including the supposedly conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones, supervenes on any physical activity,
</em><br />
<br />I'm afraid this does not follow from Maudlin (1989) or me (1988). It is 
<br />
more related to the Putnam, Chalmers, Mallah (in the list) 
<br />
implementation problem.  Maudlin shows that if comp is true and if 
<br />
physical supervenience is true then consciousness supervenes on no 
<br />
physical activity at all. From this absurdity he derives a problem for 
<br />
comp. Having comp as main hypothesis, I derive from such absurdity the 
<br />
difficulty of maintaining the physical supervenience theory. But even 
<br />
with just quantum mechanics, the notion of physical supervenience is 
<br />
not entirely clear.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; or that computations do not supervene on physical activity at all but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are complete in themselves, consciousness included, by virtue of their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; status as Platonic objects. Bruno concludes that the latter is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; case, but Maudlin appears to take both possibilities as obviously 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absurd and thus presents the paper as a problem with computationalism 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; itself.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, if you read carefully Maudlin, he concludes that throwing out 
<br />
comp does not solve his problem. He is aware that the problem is more 
<br />
related to physical supervenience than with comp. What is strange, with 
<br />
Maudlin, is that he wrote an excellent book on Bell's inequality and he 
<br />
seems aware that &quot;matter&quot; is not an easy concept too (so I don't 
<br />
understand why he feels so sorry for abandoning physical supervenience, 
<br />
when such a concept is not even clear once you understand that &quot;quantum 
<br />
matter&quot; is not well defined.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: Why are we not zombies? The answer is in the fact of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; self-referencing. In our case [as hominids] there are peculiarities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of construction and function arisen from our evolutionary history, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; but there is nothing in principle to deny self-awareness from a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; silicon-electronic entity that embodied sufficient details within a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; model of self in the world. The existence of such a model would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; constitute its mind, broadly speaking, and the updating of the model 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of self in the world would be the experience of self awareness. What 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; it would be like TO BE the updating of such a model of self in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; world is something we will probably have to wait awhile to be told  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems reasonable to theorise that if an entity could behave like a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious being, it must be a conscious being.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is the no-zombie theory. One question is:  &quot;could behave like&quot; for 
<br />
how long?  Now this question makes sense only for those who take the 
<br />
physical supervenience for granted. But then with comp, accepting my 
<br />
argument + Maudlin (say),  there is no problem at all: consciousness of 
<br />
one individual supervene on an infinity of immaterial computations, 
<br />
never on anything singularized, by Matter or anything else. Matter's 
<br />
role consists in &quot;assembling&quot; coherent dream so that consciousness can 
<br />
manifest themselves relatively to other consciousness. The &quot;essence&quot; of 
<br />
matter relies in the possibility of inter-subjective constructions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, the theory does not have the strength of logical necessity. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is quite possible that if nature had electronic circuits to play 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with, beings displaying intelligent behaviour similar to our own may 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have evolved, but lacking consciousness. This need not lead to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; usual criticism: in that case, how can I be sure my fellow humans are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious? My fellow humans not only behave like me, they have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; biological brain like me. We would have to invoke magic to explain how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God has breathed consciousness into one person but not another, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is no such theoretical problem if the other person turns out to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be a robot. My personal view is that if a computer simply learned to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy my behaviour by studying me closely if it were conscious it would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably be differently conscious. If the computer attempted to copy 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me by emulating my neuronal activity I would be more confident that it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was conscious in the same way I am, although I would not be 100% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain. But if I were copied in a teleportation experiment to a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar tolerance level as occurs in normal moment to moment living, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would be absurd to seriously contemplate that the copy was a zombie 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or differed significantly in his experiences from the original.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, ok.
<br />
