Various projects exist today aiming at building a true Artificial
<br />
Intelligence.  Sometimes these researchers use the term AGI, Artificial
<br />
General Intelligence, to distinguish their projects from mainstream AI
<br />
which tends to focus on specific tasks.  A conference on such projects
<br />
will be held next year, agi-08.org.
<br />
<br />Suppose one of these projects achieves one of the milestone goals of
<br />
such efforts; their AI becomes able to educate itself by reading books
<br />
and reference material, rather than having to have facts put in by
<br />
the developers.  Perhaps it requires some help with this, and various
<br />
questions and ambiguities need to be answered by humans, but still this is
<br />
a huge advancement as the AI can now in principle learn almost any field.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that this AI is far from passing the Turing test; it is able
<br />
to absorb and digest material and then answer questions or perhaps even
<br />
engage in a dialog about it.  But its complexity is, we will suppose,
<br />
substantially less than the human brain.
<br />
<br />Now at some point the AI reads about the philosophy of mind, and the
<br />
question is put to it: are you conscious?
<br />
<br />How might an AI program go about answering a question like this?
<br />
What kind of reasoning would be applicable?  In principle, how would
<br />
you expect a well-designed AI to decide if it is conscious?  And then,
<br />
how or why is the reasoning different if a human rather than an AI is
<br />
answering them?
<br />
<br />Clearly the AI has to start with the definition.  It needs to know what
<br />
consciousness is, what the word means, in order to decide if it applies.
<br />
Unfortunately such definitions usually amount to either a list of
<br />
synonyms for consciousness, or use the common human biological heritage
<br />
as a reference.  From the Wikipedia: &quot;Consciousness is a quality of the
<br />
mind generally regarded to comprise qualities such as subjectivity,
<br />
self-awareness, sentience, sapience, and the ability to perceive the
<br />
relationship between oneself and one's environment.&quot;  Here we have four
<br />
synonyms and one relational description which would arguably apply to
<br />
any computer system that has environmental sensors, unless &quot;perceive&quot;
<br />
is also merely another synonym for conscious perception.
<br />
<br />It looks to me like AIs, even ones much more sophisticated than I am
<br />
describing here, are going to have a hard time deciding whether they
<br />
are conscious in the human sense.  Since humans seem essentially unable
<br />
to describe consciousness in any reasonable operational terms, there
<br />
doesn't seem any acceptable way for an AI to decide whether the word
<br />
applies to itself.
<br />
<br />And given this failure, it calls into question the ease with which
<br />
humans assert that they are conscious.  How do we really know that
<br />
we are conscious?  For example, how do we know that what we call
<br />
consciousness is what everyone else calls consciousness?  I am worried
<br />
that many people believe they are conscious simply because as children,
<br />
they were told they were conscious.  They were told that consciousness
<br />
is the difference between being awake and being asleep, and assume on
<br />
that basis that when they are awake they are conscious.  Then all those
<br />
other synonyms are treated the same way.
<br />
<br />Yet most humans would not admit to any doubt that they are conscious.
<br />
For such a slippery and seemingly undefinable concept, it seems odd
<br />
that people are so sure of it.  Why, then, can't an AI achieve a similar
<br />
degree of certainty?  Do you think a properly programmed AI would ever
<br />
say, yes, I am conscious, because I have subjectivity, self-awareness,
<br />
sentience, sapience, etc., and I know this because it is just inherent in
<br />
my artificial brain?  Presumably we could program the AI to say this,
<br />
and to believe it (in whatever sense that word applies), but is it
<br />
something an AI could logically conclude?
<br />
