<br />
<br />Jump away! I'm letting EC 'rules of formation' ferment at the moment....
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Preamble... the mental secret to EC is to attend to one of my all time
<br />
faves: Leibniz. His approach has always born fruit in my analyses. What he
<br />
was on about, translated into modern jargon, was that brain operation is a
<br />
literal metaphor for the deep structure of matter. Brain operation is a
<br />
whole bunch of nested resonating loops. I have observed in general and found
<br />
the same pattern in a lot of things - trees, clouds... and most wonderfully
<br />
in the boiling froth... rice is best. :-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Time. 
<br />
<br />It's important to distinguish between the mental perception of it and the
<br />
reality of it. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />* TIME PERCEIVED
<br />
<br />There is a neurological condition (name escapes me) where the visual field
<br />
is updated on mass as usual but at a repetition rate much lower than usual.
<br />
Try pouring a glass of wine.... you see the glass at one instant and the
<br />
next time you see it: overfull. Try crossing a road. A car is 200m away...
<br />
you walk and bang, it's 10m away. All throughout this, EC state changes have
<br />
been running normally.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />In a normally operating brain in the face of novelty, where more brain
<br />
regions are involved as a result of dealing with the novelty (such as when
<br />
traveling in a new area), more energy is recruited, more brain regions are
<br />
active and the cognitive update rate is increased. Time feels like its going
<br />
slower. All throughout this, EC state changes have been running normally.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />* TIME REALITY - according to EC
<br />
<br />Time is virtual. There is only EC proof and its current state. The best way
<br />
of imaging it is to think of it as a nested structure of &quot;nearest neighbour
<br />
interactions&quot; according to a local 'energy' optimization rule. 'Energy' is a
<br />
metric counting how many ()s there are in a given structure and how many it
<br />
can do without and still remain the same 'thing'. () () could go to (()())
<br />
or vice versa. It doesn't matter. Overall it's a one way trip (door slams
<br />
behind you) depending on what 'nearest neighbour' situation results from the
<br />
present 'nearest neighbour' situation. Locally there can be lossless EC
<br />
transformations. Globally the net result is dissipation back to primitive ()
<br />
(and then to its constituents (noise). There is no future, only next state.
<br />
It looks like 2nd law of thermodynamics from within it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />By traveling fast through the EC string (like a wave through water) the
<br />
faster you go compared to the refresh rate of EC-you by the () structure
<br />
that is you, your structural state-evolution will proceed at a lower rate
<br />
than other pieces of the EC string. EC 'you' (organisation only) is moving,
<br />
but your structure is merely being replicated within the EC string, not
<br />
moving at all. If we have had a previous metaphor for the EC string I'd call
<br />
it what was once called 'the ether'. Although it's not 'real' in the sense
<br />
that it was once thought - just a concept - a way of viewing the EC string.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />When you are in EC it looks like more relative speed (compared your local EC
<br />
string), time goes slower. Traveling faster than the speed of light is
<br />
meaningless EC can't 'construct/refresh' you beyond the rate it's () operate
<br />
at. There's nothing to travel in anything and nothing to travel. It's
<br />
meaningless.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />In deep 'time' (many more state changes in the proof beyond 'now') EC
<br />
predicts (I think) the equivalent of approaching the speed of light, only
<br />
not through moving fast, but by dissipation of the fabric of space/matter
<br />
(there is no time). To be alive then (see how our words are troublesome?)
<br />
would feel the same. But if you compared the rate of progress of EC would be
<br />
different. An EC aging process of the time it takes to write WORD in the
<br />
year 10^^25 could be our equivalent of 3 months of current EC state
<br />
evolution. It's the same effect as that got by going really fast.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />When you are inside EC and local structure evolves in an organised way and
<br />
achieves regularity it means an abstraction of an EC structure can have a t
<br />
in it. Unfortunately..then we get distracted by the t possibly being
<br />
negative and &gt;&gt; now and start talking as if time was real and the
<br />
abstraction was more than an abstraction. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Working in EC is very different because of the nature of its predictions. It
<br />
predicts a thing that behaves like what we see. Gravity, QM, space, cells,
<br />
atoms etc. So when you call for evidence you've sort of got it already. At
<br />
the same time any particular EC is very refutable because it only has to
<br />
mis-predict once and it's out. Take your EC proposition back to the drawing
<br />
board and rework it. I'm only really interested in the aspects of EC as
<br />
applied to perception and brain material: the relevance of Church's work in
<br />
paramount in that regard. I don't have to have the exact EC we inhabit
<br />
worked out - the basic principles apply to the whole class of possible
<br />
calculi.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Does this make sense?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />That's what EC tells me/predicts.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Colin Hales.
