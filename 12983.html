Thanks for the interesting link Jason,   Douglas Jones is obviously a 
<br />
very clever and thoughtful person.  
<br />
<br />One interesting thing about &quot;A Conversation&quot; [and I didn't read all of 
<br />
it because it is LONG as the author warns us] is how it balances the 
<br />
extremes of optimism and pessimism. The pessimism is expressed in Bob's 
<br />
hints and descriptions of the ugliness that people can create in 
<br />
their/our treatment of each other. The optimism is in the infinity of 
<br />
potential of the 'cyberspace' where Bob /actually/  lives.
<br />
<br />As I said I didn't read all of it, but dipped in and out, may be read 
<br />
30% of it. My complaint about it, for want of a better word, is that it 
<br />
does not seem to deal with entropy or the distinction between digital 
<br />
versus analogue universes, or indeed a patentable design for an 
<br />
interface. Bob' one-way 'Door' is of course a read-and-destroy 
<br />
teleporter station, and therefore a form of suicide machine; cyberspace 
<br />
is the 'promised land', the good news that comes after the bad news. 
<br />
Overall it makes quite happy reading, though I really do think Douglas 
<br />
Jones has paid far too much attention to the claims of people who say 
<br />
they have been abducted by Aliens. I personally have only experienced 
<br />
the 'paralysis' that accompanies night terrors a few times and I chanced 
<br />
to wake up each time within 20 or 30 seconds of the onset of the 
<br />
experience. I think I was very fortunate in that respect because at the 
<br />
time, about 30 years ago, I was much more 'open minded' than I am now 
<br />
and could well have ended up believing a complete load of old cobblers 
<br />
that might have been very hard to escape.
<br />
<br />I'll say no more to that because it is off topic
<br />
<br />On-topic however, is my assertion that &gt;&gt; the human universe is always 
<br />
potentially infinite, so long as it exists and we believe it to be so &lt;&lt;.
<br />
<br />In bygone eras people were confined to saying things like: &quot;Where 
<br />
there's life, there's hope!&quot;. That is still true, and appropriate for 
<br />
many circumstances but it is a bit low-tech for the modern era. The 
<br />
potential infinity of the human universe is based on our subjective 
<br />
ability to imagine things being other than they are, and on our 
<br />
objective ability to change the world around us. The first involves 
<br />
simulation within the mind, the second involves implementation of the 
<br />
results of mental simulation. And of course these processes are 
<br />
potentially recursive to an extent limited ultimately by our 
<br />
intelligence, loosely speaking, and our desire to maximise the survival 
<br />
prospects of our descendants and their contemporaries.
<br />
<br />I don't think it is 'moralising' to point out that every thing we do has 
<br />
an opportunity cost, including speculation concerning simulations and 
<br />
replications of universes.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think such simulation will be the ultimate goal of technology for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any intelligent and curious species.  Simulation is the ultimate form
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of exploration as it allows connections to be made between otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unreachable universes.  If every possible universe exists and each is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; non-interacting, the only way to &quot;explore&quot; the other possibilities for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existance would be simulation.  Any universes where a Turing machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be built can discover all Turing emulable universes.  New
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes are not being created when a simulation is conducted, rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a connection is made to a possible existance which has always been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Douglas Jones wrote a very interesting hypothetical conversation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between a human and a highly advanced alien who lives in &quot;cyberspace&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where not only can any imaginable environment or universebe be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulated, but all beings like him had thier minds uploaded and are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also simulated.  It is available at <a href="http://www.station1.net/douglasjones/aconvers.htm">http://www.station1.net/douglasjones/aconvers.htm</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and is well worth the read.  Mind uploading and simulation I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be desirable to any intelligent and sufficently advanced race.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It offers unlimited freedom, immortality (or at least greatly extended
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existance), and the ability to participate in fully immersive &quot;game
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds&quot; which are subjectively indistingushable from any other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe there may even be a statistical argument for our existance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in such a &quot;game world&quot; now.  Consider that in human history, about 60
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; billion humans have ever lived.  If humanity reaches a technological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; singularity in the near future, and the majority of the human race
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uploaded their minds into computers, it would only take each person on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; average playing 10 lifetimes (600-700 years) worth of these immersive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; games before the bulk of human experience has been simulated as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opposed to physical.  Considering such a civilization could last many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; billions of years if not longer, the simulated human experiences would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; greatly outweigh the physics-based ones.
