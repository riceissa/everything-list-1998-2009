<br />
Dear &quot;Everything List&quot; (and &quot;Psyche-B&quot;),
<br />
<br />Here is the promised 'fundamental principle of the Chalmers kind'. Note:
<br />
there is no magical emergence here. There is no panpsychism here. There is
<br />
no dualism here.
<br />
<br />If there is apparent logical circularity, it is of a kind far less
<br />
problematic than alternate views in that it includes empirical
<br />
self-refutation. It is scientifically quite reasonable although rather
<br />
unique in that science _itself_ has to change, NOT discover any new
<br />
natural laws - it merely has to properly understand the difference between
<br />
description and explanation and that each is valid science in its own
<br />
domain. The former domain is description of the behaviour of appearances,
<br />
the latter domain is descriptions of underlying structure predictive of
<br />
the appearances themselves. That they were ever the one scientific domain
<br />
has been our mistake all along.
<br />
<br />You will find apparent contradiction in what lies below. In one place a
<br />
'constitutive primitive' is required. At that same time an 'atomistic'
<br />
explanation is later eschewed. That these two positions can be held
<br />
simulataneously seems a contradiction.... but that is not the case... and
<br />
the reasons are the subtlties contained in (5) below - the 'constitutive
<br />
primitive' is not a thing, but an event that acts 'as-if' it was a thing -
<br />
or that appears behaving 'thingly' to us. Things are thus all 'as-if' or
<br />
virtual constructs.
<br />
<br />I do not claim TPONOG to be perfect... I claim it merely to be somewhere
<br />
closer to the right answer than any we have thus far and is completely
<br />
seamlessly compatible with all science done thus far.
<br />
<br />If you follow where this principle points, as i have for many
<br />
years...through physics to chemistry to cell biology to cognition and
<br />
phsychology.... you end up being predictive of what is going on in brain
<br />
material and in particular the source of its phenomenal contents.
<br />
<br />Firstly: You end up concluding that the universe is a form of 'wild-type'
<br />
calculus - (literally a mathematics..and the ONLY instantated
<br />
mathematics).
<br />
<br />Secondly: They key to understanding how brain material generates
<br />
phenomenal consciousness, given that all appears merely as space and
<br />
charge with some mass options attached, making it a quintessentially
<br />
electromagnetic condensed phase phenomenon.... is the realisation that
<br />
describing a universe in which electromagnetism of certain kinds delivers
<br />
phenomenal consciousness is NOT the description delivered BY phenomenal
<br />
consciousness....it is a separate but intimately inter-related description
<br />
of underlying structure.
<br />
<br />You also get to understand why this issue has been so problematic (see (e)
<br />
below) for science....because...It is the deep phsyics of the biology of
<br />
excitable cells that holds the key empirical route to understanding what
<br />
the universe is made of (NOT observations of what happens in a
<br />
supercollider or in the cosmos though a telescope)....which means that the
<br />
top two &quot;Science&quot; journal June '05' issue '125' questions:
<br />
<br />1) What is the universe made of?
<br />
2) What is the biological basis of consciousness?
<br />
<br />are actually the same question, have their empirical evidence in brain
<br />
material, and the only reason we haven't answered them both already is
<br />
that (1) was posed by cosmologists, (2) was posed by neuroscientists and
<br />
the twain simply do not meet, for no good reason than historical accident
<br />
and scientific culture - for the cosmologists handed the neuroscientists
<br />
their explanatory toolkit centuries ago and haven't been back since.
<br />
Neuroscience has all the evidence and can't see it. Cosmologists have the
<br />
purview and can;t see any evidence! A cultural problem of the 'chinese
<br />
puzzle' kind.
<br />
<br />I have CC'd this to the Psyche-B list. It is highly relevant to them and I
<br />
thought they may be interested in the discussion and might appreciate a
<br />
critical gnaw on a juicy bone. To me, a 'Theory of Everything' and the
<br />
process of sorting out consciousness are necessarily unified scientific
<br />
activities. In that unification the answers await us.
<br />
<br />regards,
<br />
<br />Colin Hales

<br />=========================================================
<br />
The Principle of Natural Ontic Genesis (Version_0)
<br />
<br />&quot;It is a fundamentally necessary and implicit fact of the natural world,
<br />
regardless of any particular constitutive structural primitive(s)
<br />
comprising the natural world that any persistent collaborative subset of
<br />
them, say X, howsoever organised and howsoever considered in any arbitrary
<br />
grouping, creates an innate perspective from the point of view of being
<br />
such a collection; a perspective that is necessarily of the remainder of
<br />
the natural world, not_X&quot;.
<br />
<br />Remarks
<br />
1.	The principle is quite general. No particular constitutive primitive
<br />
has been assumed.
<br />
<br />2.	The principle says absolutely nothing about the visibility of that
<br />
innate perspective. The visibility circumstances, character and content
<br />
are entirely separate considerations with options dependent upon the
<br />
particular constitutive primitives under consideration and their
<br />
particular arrangement.
<br />
<br />3.	The entire collection of constitutive primitive(s) literally is the
<br />
universe (the natural world).
<br />
<br />4.	The entire collection of constitutive primitive(s) is what Kant called
<br />
the noumenon or the 'ding an sich'. Others (such as Ernst Mach) might call
<br />
it the 'underlying natural world' or 'underlying reality'.
<br />
<br />5.	The simple approach to this is that 'being' occurs at the moment any
<br />
persistent structure (say X) arises, for in so doing it implicitly
<br />
automatically and naturally creates everything that is not that structure
<br />
(not_X). Automatically created at that instant is a perspective of not_X
<br />
from the point of view of X and vice versa, for not_X must be as
<br />
persistently expressed as X, or neither would exist. This necessarily
<br />
precludes any and all atomistic formulations of constitutive primitives.
<br />
Put more simply: the only viable constitutive primitives are events, not
<br />
things.
<br />
<br />6.	The event of the coming into existence (coalescence, condensation or
<br />
coherence) of any persistent structure X within a total collection of
<br />
constitutive primitives, U, cannot occur without perfect symmetrical
<br />
cooperation from all of the rest of the constitutive primitive(s) not_X.
<br />
Put another way, X and not_X exist as perfectly inverse equals that
<br />
literally express each other.
<br />
<br />7.	The principle makes no claim that all matter involves some form of mind
<br />
or that the whole universe is an organism that possesses a mind or that
<br />
the constituents of the universe are sentient in any way. No such claims
<br />
are needed. In particular Cartesian 'mind stuff' is unnecessary and
<br />
irrelevant. As such the principle cannot be said to be panpsychism.
<br />
However, it would seem to have panpsychist characteristics in that the
<br />
resultant properties involved in the creation of mind are naturally built
<br />
into the circumstances of the fabric of the universe.
<br />
<br />Some rough corollaries:
<br />
<br />a)	It is intrinsically meaningless that the constitutive primitive(s)
<br />
themselves may ever be directly revealed in any contrived perspective view
<br />
provided through making use of the potential for rendering the perspective
<br />
visible in some fashion.
<br />
<br />b)	As a result of a), it can be asserted that all empirical laws are
<br />
descriptions of the behaviour of the contents of a visible perspective
<br />
view thus provided and that the process of provision of empirical laws
<br />
fundamentally includes the perspective view (literally: the constitutive
<br />
primitives that render a perspective visible) within its descriptions. The
<br />
generalisations that are empirical laws can never stand alone outside the
<br />
context of the empiricist (observer).
<br />
<br />c)	As a result of b). Empirical laws play no causal role in the
<br />
machinations of the universe, nor does the observer play any active role
<br />
in creation of the universe. This role is under the sole purview of the
<br />
interactions of the constitutive primitive(s). This makes all empirical
<br />
(mathematical) models of the universe causally inert and merely metaphor
<br />
for constitutive primitive behaviour in certain aggregations.
<br />
<br />d)	As layers of organisation are stripped away (eg humanity, human, organ,
<br />
tissue, cell, molecule, atom, atomic particle, subatomic particle......an so
<br />
on), any visible perspective view of the behaviour of the remaining
<br />
organisational layers shall necessarily reveal visible behaviour more
<br />
closely aligned with to the behaviour of the real underlying constitutive
<br />
primitive(s). This process shall act as a guide to the most likely forms
<br />
of the class of viable constitutive primitive(s) involved in the universe
<br />
in which humans are embedded.
<br />
<br />e)	Because we know that, from the perspective of being a human, that there
<br />
most definitely is a perspective view of the rest of the universe, we
<br />
necessarily exist in a universe constructed of constitutive primitive(s)
<br />
of a kind that enables the visible perspective possible when such
<br />
constitutive primitives are organised in the fashion it self-reveals as
<br />
brain material. That perspective view is what we call 'phenomenal
<br />
consciousness'. As a result of a), b), c) we can also conclude that
<br />
science constrained to contents of consciousness, such as 'The Neural
<br />
Correlates of Consciousness' paradigm, will never explain phenomenal
<br />
consciousness because it is a meaningless expectation based on the
<br />
assumption that constitutive primitives and contents of consciousness are
<br />
identities.
