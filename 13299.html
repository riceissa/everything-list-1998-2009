Hi John,
<br />
<br />The 24 Feb 2007, à 23:59, John Mikes wrote in parts, to Jason:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Don't tell me please such &quot;Brunoistic&quot; examples like 1+1 = 2, go out 
<br />
into the 'life' of a universe (or of ourselves).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />All right, let me try to give you a less 'Brunoistic&quot; relation among 
<br />
numbers, if you can imagine this possible!.
<br />
<br />I am afraid this will be a long post, as I will point toward the 
<br />
unravelling of  the origin of the multiverses---and the mess within  
<br />
:-)
<br />
<br />And I will not be theological, nor interview any universal machine, but 
<br />
this little trip in the less brunoistic (hopefully) part of platonia 
<br />
could perhaps help for explaining or illustrating the interview later.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />But then I have to ask you, also, to accept a deep, but not so well 
<br />
known, except by the Greeks of course, truth about numbers.
<br />
<br />(... making this post not for children, and probably neither 
<br />
politically correct ...)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />But numbers have gender.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />You have male numbers and female numbers. The rule is simple: odd 
<br />
numbers are male, and even numbers are female:
<br />
<br /><br />ODD = MALE;    EVEN = FEMALE
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Aparte: I guess the Greeks were a bit macho by thinking that the very 
<br />
*first*, its majesty the one, 1, was a male. Today we are a bit more 
<br />
modern, I guess, and we know that the big 1 is really situated in 
<br />
between the two most terrible female of Platonia:  the number 0 (death) 
<br />
and the number 2 (Life, the Pythagorean Indefinite Dyad, ...).  ... and 
<br />
then comes 3, oh my! it's a boy! ...]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />TOC, TOC, TOC!
<br />
<br /><br />What's that now? Ooooh!!! ... a categorical daemon!!!:
<br />
&quot;--- about life and death, 0 and 2, add the arrows! add the arrows!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Categorical daemons always ask you to add arrows).   ...
<br />
&quot;0 -&gt; 2 = elementary creation operator, 2 -&gt; 0 = elementary 
<br />
annihilation operator, cup and cap in quantum topological Temperley 
<br />
Lieb categories, ...&quot;.
<br />
<br />(ok, ok, keep calm, I manage the categorical daemon..)
<br />
<br /><br />Let us go back to pure (without arrows) numbers ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br />SURPRISE PARTY!
<br />
<br />Now, if numbers have gender, it obviously follows, mainly by addition 
<br />
and multiplication, that, contrary to a widespread rumor about Platonia 
<br />
austerity, there are many surprise parties in Platonia. Number 
<br />
theorists would talk about *surprising partitions* but let us not be 
<br />
distracted by vocabulary question (see the biblio below).
<br />
<br />And, of course, it follows from this that numbers have clothes: you 
<br />
would'nt imagine a number going naked to a party, all right?
<br />
<br />Now, giving that we dispose only of numbers, together with addition and 
<br />
multiplication, a clothe can only be a sum of product or a product of 
<br />
sums, of numbers, including, for more decoration purpose (by pure 
<br />
Platonia's frivolity!), integers:   ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...
<br />
<br /><br /><br />THE FOUR SQUARE PARTY
<br />
<br />A very famous and popular party has always been the *four square* party 
<br />
where numbers are permitted to participate only if disguised as a sum 
<br />
of four squared integers. For exemple  the number eleven can put the 
<br />
following clothe: (-1)^2 + (-3)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 9 + 0 + 1 = 11. The 
<br />
order in the sum distinguishes the clothes: 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2  and 
<br />
4^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 are two different clothes of the number  30, for 
<br />
example.
<br />
<br /><br />Death has only one clothe,  in its garde robe: 0 = 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2
<br />
<br /><br />And 1 ?  One has eight clothes!
<br />
<br /><br />1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2
<br />
0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2
<br />
0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 + 0^2
<br />
0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 1^2
<br />
<br />and
<br />
<br />(-1)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2
<br />
0^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2
<br />
0^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2
<br />
0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2
<br />
<br /><br /><br />And Life? The number 2, how big is her garde-robe? I let you play with 
<br />
it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[ .......................... (= symbolic time you are playing with it), 
<br />
of course take *your* time.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Answer: 24.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Hmmmm.....
<br />
<br /><br />POPULARITY
<br />
<br />Where did the popularity of the four square party come from? Because 
<br />
all natural numbers have four square clothes, i.e. any natural number 
<br />
can be put in the form a^2 + b^2 + c^2 +d^2 for some a, b, c, d, 
<br />
integers. Why? Because
<br />
<br /><br />LAGRANGE THEOREM (say so).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />And what is remarkable about that theorem?
<br />
<br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Err ... Well, what is remarkable is that EULER did not find the proof 
<br />
of it, according to bad tongues. (Worst tongues say that Euler did not 
<br />
find any proof, which is a comble of unfairness given that it is Gauss 
<br />
who will introduce later the rigorous (although informal) notion of 
<br />
proof.
<br />
To evaluate the unfairness,, remind yourselve that Euler solved BASEL 
<br />
problem, at the age of 15. Everybody knew, experimentally, that the 
<br />
infinite sum of the inverse of the squared natural numbers: 1/1^2 + 
<br />
1/2^2 + 1/3^2 + 1/4^2 + 1/5^2 + ... converges to some anonymous real 
<br />
number: 1,6..., but Euler recognizes it: one sixth of the square of PI. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1/6 (PI)^2, = 1, 64493406..., relating square numbers and the circle! 
<br />
That was a famous problem which has defeated the big one like Leibnitz, 
<br />
Newton, and even the whole Bernouilli family.
<br />
<br />So, later Lagrange found a proof that indeed all natural numbers have a 
<br />
non empty garde-robe, and I have myself found a short proof in ... the 
<br />
first appendix of the marvellous Matiyasevitch book!
<br />
... and I have found another short proof in a book by Ian Stewart and 
<br />
David Tall, based on an important theorem in geometrical number theory 
<br />
by Minkowski (yes, the physicist, the treator was doing number theory 
<br />
part time! Note that if you meet the name of Bohr in number theory, 
<br />
don't conclude that Niels Bohr the physicist is also a physicist 
<br />
treator, Harald Bohr the number theorist was just Niels Bohr's brother 
<br />
..)
<br />
<br /><br />... and what all this has to do with the physical multiverse ? (Keep 
<br />
on, John, we are driven toward it).
<br />
<br /><br /><br />THE GARDE ROBE SIZE PROBLEM
<br />
<br />A question arises. 8, 24, is there a pattern? How many clothes have 
<br />
each natural numbers? Is there a rule? Is there a simple formula 
<br />
capable of giving the size of each number garde robe?
<br />
<br />Yes, there is one. Or more simply, there are two related simple rules, 
<br />
as it is simpler (as we could have guess) to separate the rule for the 
<br />
garde-robe of the male numbers and the rule for the garde-robe of the 
<br />
female numbers.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />JACOBI THEOREM:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) All odd numbers have a garde-robe containing 8 times the sum of 
<br />
its divisors.
<br />
<br /><br />Female numbers are both more demanding and more choosy:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) All even numbers have a garde-robe containing 24 times the sum 
<br />
of its *odd* divisors.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />...
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />And what is remarkable about JACOBI theorem---beyond that feeling of 
<br />
déjà-vu?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />What is remarkable is that such relations have ever been able to be 
<br />
proved. Unlike Lagranges theorem (the democratic character of the four 
<br />
square party), which admits a two pages proof, well, I have not found 
<br />
any short proof of Jacobi theorem.
<br />
<br />One  proof relates Partition Theory (the &quot;surprise party&quot; branch of 
<br />
number theory, usually called the additive number theory), that branch 
<br />
includes big set of marvellous formula by Euler ---so I said, one of 
<br />
the proof relates partition theory, modular form, Heat Theory (sic), 
<br />
Jacobi theta series ... Yes, you have to wandle in the space of heat 
<br />
equation solutions space!
<br />
<br />Ah! But I found a more modern proof where it is a &quot;simple&quot; consequence 
<br />
of the existence of a ... super boson fermion correspondence in some 
<br />
(abstract!) stringy quantum field theories!
<br />
<br /><br />This illustrates a new phenomenon in the story of the relation between 
<br />
math and physics. The physicist, like Einstein, were used to pick 
<br />
already existing mathematical theories (tensor calculus, Hilbert space 
<br />
theory, ...) to develop their physical theories. Today, mathematical 
<br />
physics has superseded the mathematical sophisticateness of the 
<br />
mathematicians, and it looks like the physical universe is just God's 
<br />
hint for solving purely number theoretical problems. It shows also that 
<br />
number theorists, would they have the right fundamental motivations, 
<br />
could as well find the physical TOE we are searching ...
<br />
<br />But I don't want really push all this forward. One reason is that such 
<br />
a line could lead us in really hard mathematical stuff, and this would 
<br />
make people flying out of this informal list conversation. But the main 
<br />
reason is that I would not like to encourage the number theorists into 
<br />
searching this physical TOE.
<br />
<br /><br />Why?
<br />
<br /><br />Hmmm... Because,  it is said,  in the &quot;Chronicles of the Multiple Third 
<br />
Millenia&quot; that in those realities where number theorists find the 
<br />
physical TOE, the third millenia are wittnessing the suffering of acute 
<br />
arrogant *numberism* capable of perpetuating the two Millenia old 
<br />
Aristotelian physicalist person elimination. On the contrary, in those 
<br />
third millenia-realities where the *correct and unphysicalist* TOE are 
<br />
discovered by the platonist or neoplotinist theologians, the person 
<br />
notions and rights will be saved so that we will not have to live again 
<br />
one more millenia of authoritative obscurantism in the human 
<br />
sciences---and in that case I will not have to come back again, so that 
<br />
I will be able to take some well deserve (in that case only) holidays 
<br />
:-)
<br />
<br />And that is why I will preferably keep on with my brunoistic simple 
<br />
examples of number relations, like &quot;1+1=2&quot;, or &quot;17 is prime&quot;, instead 
<br />
of Jacobi theorems or any other deeply fascinating purely third person 
<br />
number theoretical truth.
<br />
<br /><br />Instead, I will insist more than ever on the advantage of extracting 
<br />
physics *and* actually extracting the whole conceptual unification of 
<br />
*all* fields through the interview of the lobian universal 
<br />
self-observing machine, which guarantees, through Lobian 
<br />
incompleteness, the non-normative acceptance of the reality of the 
<br />
many-many-person-many-many-points-of-view.
<br />
<br /><br />Best regards,
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Bibliography:
<br />
<br />A very nice introduction to the general number partition theory is 
<br />
given by the adorable little book by George E. Andrews and Kimmo 
<br />
Eriksson: INTEGER PARTITIONS, Cambridge University Press, 2004.
<br />
<br />I have already given the reference of Yuri Matiyasevich chef d'oeuvre: 
<br />
Hilbert's Tenth Problem, MIT Press, 1996 (third printing). Lagrange 
<br />
theorem is proved in the appendix.
<br />
<br />The proof of Lagrange theorem based on Minkowski's geometrical number 
<br />
theory can be found in the book by Ian Steward and David Tall: 
<br />
Algebraic Number Theory and Fermat's Last Theorem, A.K. Peters Ltd, 
<br />
Natick MA, 2002.
<br />
<br />The first proof of Jacobi Theorem, the one who makes you make a non 
<br />
standard trip through heat theory, can be found in the book by Yves 
<br />
Hellegouarch, Invitation to the Mathematics of Fermat-Wiles, Academic 
<br />
Press, Elsevier, (translated from the french) 2002.
<br />
<br />The second proof of Jacobi theorem, the one which makes it a 
<br />
consequence of the existence of super fermions-bosons correspondence in 
<br />
physics, can be found in the book by Victor Kac: Vertex Algebras for 
<br />
Beginners, American Mathematical Society, University Lectures Series, 
<br />
Vol. 10, Rhode Island, 1997. The label &quot;beginners&quot; is misleading: you 
<br />
don't have to know anything, indeed, about Vertex Operator Algebras, 
<br />
but you have to know almost everything about almost all other known 
<br />
operator algebras!  ... Not easy stuff, even for mathematicians.
<br />
<br />The awakening of the &quot;categorical daemon&quot; points toward the recent 
<br />
works by
<br />
1) Samson Abramski : Temperley-Lieb Algebra: From Knot Theory to Logic 
<br />
and Computation via Quantum Mechanics,
<br />
and by
<br />
2) Louis Kauffman: q-deformed Spin Networks, Knot Polynomials and 
<br />
Anyonic Topological Quantum Computation. You can find both of them 
<br />
freely on the net. They both confirmed my feeling that knot theory 
<br />
provides the reasonable combinatorial discrete structures which should 
<br />
appear in between number and physics.  Similar such structures  
<br />
*should* (and in some sense already) appear naturally in the semantics 
<br />
of the modal theories (S4Grz1, Z1*, X1*) generated by the arithmetical 
<br />
lobian interpretation of the third, fourth and fifth Plotinus 
<br />
&quot;hypostases&quot;. If confirmed, that would justify why our physical 
<br />
neighborhood seems to be run by a *quantum* machine.
