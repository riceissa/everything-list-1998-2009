I am a quantum physics enthusiast, but merely an amateur who finds the
<br />
discussion threads of this group to be quite interesting.  I have never
<br />
before commented because, to be honest, I am rather lost in regard to the
<br />
discussion of first person and third person.  I am trying to figure out
<br />
exactly what everyone is talking about, but it would be helpful if someone
<br />
would point me to some source material on which these discussions are based.
<br />
I would like to say however, that I found the idea of shadows and smeared
<br />
selves to be a fascinating concept to think about; a delightful mental
<br />
exercise.  I will read with interest the comments that are bound to come
<br />
from those who are the experts in this group.
<br />

Subject: Shadows and smeared selves
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In this note I try to outline my current thoughts on quantum physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for your comments. I am sending this to a few mailing lists with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overlapping memberships, so you may have received this twice or more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I apologise if this is the case and also for the very imprecise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; language and gross simplifications and analogies that I am using to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make my point. While this is really a sketch of a sketch, I wish to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discuss the core idea with people who understands these things better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than I do, so please let me have your comments (even &quot;go back to your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first year textbook and stop wasting my time&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think that, while Everett's Relative State formulation of quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanics makes a lot of sense, its popular interpretation as &quot;Many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Worlds&quot;(MWI) should be taken only as a simple pictorial device useful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for a first understanding of the theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As a more accurate interpretation, I propose thinking of perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realities as shadows of a more complex reality. I suspect this is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some authors, perhaps including Everett himself, were trying to say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that others may have said it explicitly (perhaps Lockwood), so I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would appreciate any pointer to relevant works.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I will use poor Schroedinger's cat as an example. Following Everett,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cat is in a superposition of [cat dead] and [cat alive] states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before an observer opens the box and looks inside, and stays so after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (there is no collapse). After opening the box and looking inside, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer is in a superposition of [observer who remembers having seen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cat dead] and [observer who remembers having seen the cat alive].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The MWI says that after the act of observation (measurement) the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is split in two branches where the first has [cat dead] and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [observer who remembers having seen the cat dead], and the second has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [cat alive] and [observer who remembers having seen the cat alive].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The difficulty that I have is: on the one hand we are saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental reality contains no such things as cats dead or alive, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the other hand we are describing the world(s) with cats dead and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cats alive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To clarify the first part of the statement: as we can choose any two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directions to form a basis to use for the description of a particle's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spin, all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; choices generating equally valid descriptions, besides [cat dead] and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [cat alive] we should be free to use another basis to describe the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cat. While any pair of independent linear superpositions of [cat dead]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and [cat alive] will do, of course I have no idea of what such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superposition would &quot;look like&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Since I cannot remember having ever seen one, I do not know what a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superposition of [cat dead] and [cat alive] would look like, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probably I would not recognise one if I saw it. Perhaps this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reason why I cannot remember having ever seen one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, perhaps since reality is One Big World too complex for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our minds to process efficiently, we use a simplified representation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as Many (small) Worlds for our processing. This is not so surprising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when we remember that our best computer programs use data compression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and segmentation techniques, throwing most of the information away, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perform complex tasks such as face recognition efficiently. Perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reducing a complex reality to parallel worlds is a successful trick
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that sentient beings have developed to process reality more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficiently.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe thinking of shadows may be a better mental device than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking of parallel worlds. Using this model the realities that I,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and my doubles in other branches of the MWI model, perceive can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought of as shadows of a more complex reality. Observing a shadow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; permits saying certain things about its source, like size and overall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shape, but not other things like colour and smell. The shadow does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain such information. Also, much of what we can say about shadows
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has more to do with illumination and the surface where the shadow is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cast than with the actual source.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thinking of multiple worlds as shadows brings us back to Plato's cave,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but there are two important differences: First, each of us observes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shadows of the *real* world in a very large number of caves in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; parallel. Second, we are shadows ourselves, our mental computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processes being shadows of other, possibly much more complex,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In my view of the world, saying &quot;my mental computational processes&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just another way to say &quot;I&quot;. So what am I a shadow of? I don't know,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but perhaps by observing the shadow I can develop some plausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions on the source.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I know that I am a conscious being: though I am not able to put my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finger precisely on what consciousness *is*, I know that it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; property that I posses. I also think that consciousness must have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something to do with complexity: if a computational process is complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough, it may become a conscious process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, since it seems reasonable to think that a source must have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degree of complexity not lower than its shadow, we should consider the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibility that we are shadows cast by conscious sources.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Following Greg Egan who outlined something similar in his novel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Quarantine&quot;, we can use the term &quot;smeared self&quot; to indicate such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source. Your smeared self is simultaneosly conscious of a very large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of Everett branches, and you, who can only perceive one, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the shadow that your smeared self is casting on this specific branch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The mental activity of your smeared self may well be much more complex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than yours, and perhaps the interaction between I who wrote this very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; speculative and imprecise note, and you who are reading it, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shadow of a much more complex interaction between our smeared selves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
