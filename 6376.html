Dear Stan,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could I oppose the idea that consiousness is not Turing Emulable without 
<br />
being a &quot;biological chauvinist&quot;?  ;-)The main problem I have is that these 
<br />
two assumptions are mutually exclusive!
<br />
<br />1) Observer-moments exist: This requires that observer-moments have an 
<br />
ontological status that does not depend on anything other that they 
<br />
consistensy; they are elevated by postulation to having the same status as 
<br />
mathematical tautalogies, like 1 = 1, 1+2 = 3, etc.
<br />
<br />2) This mysterious consciousness thing is &quot;Turing emulable&quot;: This requires 
<br />
that for ANY 1st person experience that ANY observer might have that there 
<br />
exist at least one string of binary numbers that, when encoded on a UTM, 
<br />
will generate an simulation that if feed into a full sensory Virtual Reality 
<br />
interface, will be indistinguishable from the 1st person content of the 
<br />
consiousness.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, you might point out that it is obvious that the binary strings are 
<br />
members of the mathematical tautologies and thus have a &quot;timeless&quot; 
<br />
ontological status. I would agree with that completely, but I would point 
<br />
out that the notion of a UTM or UD does not have the same timeless status 
<br />
because it requires that there be some kind of physical process and memory 
<br />
traces/tapes/chicken scratchings/etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, unless we have some kind of observer, even if it is a UTM 
<br />
or UD itself, that can be interogated via some kind of physical interface by 
<br />
some other observer, it is logically impossible to claim that consciousness 
<br />
exists. Such would be equivalent to wondering whether of not some black box 
<br />
where capable of emulating a conscious experience without allowing any form 
<br />
of interface with the black box! The &quot;Yes Doctor&quot; idea requires that the 
<br />
consciousness that is transfered from a biological brain to silicon be 
<br />
capable of reporting its 1st person states otherwise our claims are reduced 
<br />
to mere speculations. For example see the discussion of Zombies.
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen
<br />

<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a wonderfully clear explanation of Bruno's UDA. Perhaps Bruno 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could confirm that it is what he intended.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for the observer - or more fundamentally, the observer-moment - I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you can get away without explicitly defining it. All you need is two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumptions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Firstly, you have to assume that observer-moments exist. I think it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretty clear that this is the case; you know it and I know it. You may not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know how to explain it, define it, or even describe it, but you definitely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know that observer-moments exist if you are a conscious being.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Secondly, you have to assume that this mysterious consciousness thing is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Turing emulable&quot;. It is not nearly as obvious that this second assumption 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is true, and biological chauvinists may continue to deny it no matter what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; progress AI research may make. At some point, as Bruno says, you may have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to take &quot;comp&quot; on faith; for example, say &quot;yes doctor&quot; to the offer of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; durable new electronic brain when yours is starting to break down.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It should now be clear that if both of the above assumptions are true, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then the UD should generate all the observer-moments as per Bruno and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Brian. The &quot;observer&quot; is then a derivative entity, made up of certain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subsets of observer-moments. You know what an observer-moment is through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct experience, but you have nowhere been forced to explicitly define 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it. If you want to say that consciousness is something utterly mysterious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forever, you can say this, and the UDA still holds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
