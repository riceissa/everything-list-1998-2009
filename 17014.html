<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure I can even parse this paragraph.  An &quot;I&quot; that is reflexive is one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that refers to itself.  So what is RITSIAR can refer to itself.  So it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicitly entails a unity to refer to.  Our is the unity the unity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perception, i.e. all my perceptions cohere so they are &quot;mine&quot;.  They constitute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a world being present to &quot;me&quot; from &quot;my&quot; point of view.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, more or less, so far as it goes.  But my use of the term
<br />
'reflexive' was an attempt to characterise relationship with respect
<br />
to something that can be in 'relation' only with itself because it
<br />
exists uniquely.  Consequently the relation of this unity to itself
<br />
can be conceived only as self-encounter - or what I referred to as the
<br />
paradox of the part and the whole, which we discussed before.  The &quot;I&quot;
<br />
of RITSIAR appears as a global self-reference of which 1-persons are
<br />
subsets.  If this is solipsism, then it is the solipsism of the whole,
<br />
not the part, as I have previously remarked in this list.  I suspect
<br />
that the difficulty in 'parsing' results from my attempts to
<br />
punctiliously restrict my claims to no more or less than what this
<br />
implies, but this seems often to produce the opposite response.
<br />
Sorry.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Reflexive' because it is unique;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why would being unique imply it can refer to itself - or whatever &quot;reflexive&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means in this context (&quot;unconscious reaction&quot;?)?
</em><br />
<br />See above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'personal' because it is the superset out of which 'persons' (subsets)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; emerge; 'present' because - given that such 1-persons self-assert
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'presently'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does everything RITSIAR &quot;self-assert&quot;?  I understand asserting proposition, i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assigning a value &quot;true&quot; to it.  I don't understand &quot;self-assert&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, sorry to just spring this mode of speaking on you.  I'm trying to
<br />
say that we always and only discover the 1-person through its
<br />
present-tense assertion (in the sense of personal 'assertiveness') of
<br />
itself.  Perhaps this is analogous to Heidegger's idea of 'throwness'.
<br />
&nbsp;I'm just trying to say that whatever is RITSIAR must have these
<br />
characteristics of being personal and present 'entirely through its
<br />
own efforts'.  I was trying to give a philosophically minimalistic
<br />
justification of these terms in order that I could use them
<br />
consistently at later stages of discourse.  I hope we can iron this
<br />
out through debate.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; - the background from which they can be said, for certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purposes, to distinguish themselves a fortiori constitutes a more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; inclusive 'presence'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ???
</em><br />
<br />As the part, so the whole.  The 1-person subsists in the presence
<br />
(presentness?) of the unity from which it is temporarily
<br />
distinguished.  The idea of bare presence I'm using here is intended
<br />
to support intuitions of the atemporal and aspatial - i.e. being at a
<br />
level prior to the orderings of time and space through
<br />
differentiation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course one can't know a falsehood.  Or are you saying we can't know anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but ourselves (a step toward solipism).  Or are you saying we can only know what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are through introspection (reflection)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />As so often I get the feeling that it would be so much easier to
<br />
communicate if we were all in the same room!  Anyway, yes, I'm saying
<br />
precisely that we can't know anything but ourselves, because knowing
<br />
ourselves is indivisible from being ourselves.  Therefore we know only
<br />
what is constituted by our own way-of-being. Any other approach,
<br />
AFAICS, inevitably leads straight to an infinite regress of
<br />
'observers' (sorry again about the scare quotes, but this denotes my
<br />
questioning of the ordinary use of the terms).  So let's be clear: I'm
<br />
claiming that 'knowing' is nothing more or less than all the
<br />
'ways-of-being'; individual knowledge, specifically, is a way-of-being
<br />
differentiated from the whole.  We may think of perception and action
<br />
arising indivisibly in the form of self-encounter at the 'boundaries'
<br />
established foundationally by differentiation: our detailed
<br />
self-intimacy comprising complexes of such encounters.
<br />
<br />In summary, I'm saying that 'existence' (all the foregoing stems from
<br />
my being asked to say what I meant by this term) equates to a
<br />
personally present self-intimacy, and 1-person existence is a subset
<br />
of this (hence avoiding solipsism at the level of the individual, but
<br />
embracing it at the level of the whole).  And I'm also saying that
<br />
everything that exists does so in this way *only*: all other notions
<br />
of 'existence' are parasitic on these intuitions, including -  IMHO -
<br />
COMP and other platonic schemas.  This is no doubt quite a large claim
<br />
(though I think it's implied, and sometimes explicit, in all the
<br />
metaphysical systems I've referred to - and others) but I'd be happy
<br />
to attempt to defend it in any specific instance: indeed, this is the
<br />
purpose of my taking pains to establish these foundational points of
<br />
departure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To many scare quotes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />I know, and as I've already said, I'm sorry.  If we were in the same
<br />
room, perhaps we could just waggle our fingers.  The point of this
<br />
whole exposition is to ground notions of existence and reality in a
<br />
set of intuitions that are RITSIAR all the way through.  I feel from
<br />
your comments that you take this to be unnecessary and perhaps even
<br />
wrong-headed, but to me it seems inescapable.  I am seeking
<br />
consequently to collapse at their foundations all divisibility between
<br />
knowing and being, and between perceiving, intending and acting (I've
<br />
left the scare quotes out this time, but inevitable these terms often
<br />
carry associations that are extraneous to my meaning here).  The need
<br />
for these moves seems to me inescapable in resolving the mind-body
<br />
paradoxes and dispelling the phantoms and monstrosities (unconscious
<br />
zombies, epiphenomenalism, observers distinct from observations,
<br />
purely abstract worlds etc) that emerge from them.  The terminology,
<br />
however, remains elusive.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; If I understand you correctly, this is similar to the explication of &quot;I&quot; by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Thomas Metzinger in his book &quot;The Ego Tunnel&quot;.  He expresses it as the self
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; being transparent.  We look *through* it but not *at* it, and necessarily so.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, I haven't read it, but yes, what I've been saying certainly implies this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; This paradox arises in quantum cosmogony.  The universe (or multiverse) evolves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; as the rotation of a single ray in Hilbert space.  But relativistic horizons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; separate different local projections so that we see decohered, classical objects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; (and we are such objects).  At least that's the speculation - there is both
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; unity and diversity: different aspects of the wave-function of the universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; which is unknowable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Yes, the wave function indeed expresses just such 'paradoxical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; partness in wholeness'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; You make the self fundamental, but is it so.  Maybe the self is a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; construct or a statistical ensemble or experiences.  RITSIAR may not be real in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the ontology of the best theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No, I emphatically do not make 'the self' fundamental.  In fact,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; taking my lead from Plotinus,  Vedanta et al, I would deny the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existence or necessity of any such independent existent as 'the self'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  The &quot;I&quot; that I take to be real in RITSIAR is the reflexive &quot;I&quot; of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'personally present' unity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure I can even parse this paragraph.  An &quot;I&quot; that is reflexive is one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that refers to itself.  So what is RITSIAR can refer to itself.  So it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicitly entails a unity to refer to.  Our is the unity the unity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perception, i.e. all my perceptions cohere so they are &quot;mine&quot;.  They constitute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a world being present to &quot;me&quot; from &quot;my&quot; point of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Reflexive' because it is unique;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why would being unique imply it can refer to itself - or whatever &quot;reflexive&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; means in this context (&quot;unconscious reaction&quot;?)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'personal' because it is the superset out of which 'persons' (subsets)

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does everything RITSIAR &quot;self-assert&quot;?  I understand asserting proposition, i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assigning a value &quot;true&quot; to it.  I don't understand &quot;self-assert&quot;.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ???
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Hence I claim that 'the best theory'  -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; whatever else it encompasses - can't help but be ontologically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; RITSIAR.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; But that's where I would appeal to two different senses of &quot;basic&quot;.  Basic to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; epistemology is perception/intuition/experience/cognition.  But based on that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; knowledge one may develop theory in which the ontology is different.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; No, I emphatically think not.  This is the point of my 'collapse' of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; epistemology and ontology.  My claim is that 'knowing' and 'being' are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cognates - more specifically, 'knowing' is a 'way-of-being'.  We can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; only know - reflexively - what we are and we can't know what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; aren't.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course one can't know a falsehood.  Or are you saying we can't know anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but ourselves (a step toward solipism).  Or are you saying we can only know what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are through introspection (reflection)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;AFAICS this is the only way to avoiding the otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; infinite regress between 'observer' and 'observed'.  Furthermore,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; through the intuition or insight that 'ways-of-being' are equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to instances of 'self-motivated-relativisation' of the One, we situate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'causal closure' inescapably in an indivisible unity of reflexive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'perception' and 'action'.  The consequence of this of course is 'no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; brains without minds, and vice-versa'.  These are the minimal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; requirements, IMO, of any foundational ontology capable of going on to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; account for a 'mind' or 'body' that is  RITSIAR - as opposed to being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the kind of 'Cheshire Cat' or 'arm's length' abstraction that can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; help conjuring 'philosophical zombie worlds' and other such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; monstrosities.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To many scare quotes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Physics gains knowledge from physicists looking at records and instrument readings.  But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; the theory built on this knowledge is in terms of elementary particles and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; fields.  The positivists wanted to build physics on an ontology of perceptions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; and instrument readings, but it was not at all fruitful and has been abandoned.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The trouble here, I'm convinced, is the attempt to ground the argument
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at a level of analysis that is already much too 'sophisticated' - what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; one author recently called an 'adultocentric' viewpoint.  What I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; trying to do by contrast is to base my foundational theorising solely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; on what a 'philosophical neonate' would be able - or need - to lay
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; claim to: IOW, the simplest and most irreducible logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; pre-requisites necessary to justify the 'appearances' that our later
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theorising will rely on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; You are concerned that RITSIAR can't be recovered if it's not asserted in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; beginning, but the alternative is that the ontology of the world is real in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; different sense than you are real, i.e. &quot;you&quot; are not really real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, if the 'real' ontology of the world isn't foundationally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'present' and 'personal', I have a hard time seeing how &quot;I&quot; could ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be.  You see, &quot;I&quot; don't need to be 'really real' in the sense I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you mean; but I *do* need to be *as* real - 'real' in the same sense -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as the background from which &quot;I&quot; emerge.  RITSIAR cuts both ways: &quot;I&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; am also 'real in the sense the world is real' (RITSTWIR? No - I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; take any more acronymical realities!)  So I can't be any *more*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 'present' or 'personal' than this background is, nor can I 'know' any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; more or any differently than is constituted by my 'way-of-being' in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; terms of this selfsame foundational reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are asserting monism.  But the One, the ur-stuff, is ineffable/unknowable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So when we place ourselves in the world it is by making distinctions within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unity.  To become distinct from the background (the One) is what it means to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; RITSIAR.  Right?
