<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the comp hyp refutable.
</em><br />
<br />I realise that I'm not clear about exactly what you mean by saying
<br />
that I might not be a lobian machine or entity.  Do you mean this to
<br />
apply to me alone, or that the discrepancy might indicate that humans
<br />
in general might not in fact be lobian?  Would my being 'right' in a
<br />
'non-lobian' way amount to a proof that my reasoning could not be
<br />
computationally based?  What are the principal assertions of comp that
<br />
would be refutable in this regard, and how precisely?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sometimes two different persons discussing in the list seems to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different ideas where I can see that they are both correct, but just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't not look at things from the same angle or perspective. All this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is obviously related with the very intrinsical difficulty of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subject itself.
</em><br />
<br />Difficult indeed.  It would be very helpful if we could all find a
<br />
shared method to make the perspectives commensurable.  I suspect for
<br />
you this would be comp.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you understand that the UDA literally gives no choice about what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has to be taken as primitive element for any TOE once we assume the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp hyp?
</em><br />
<br />I think so, although my personal expressions of the intuition have
<br />
been different.  For example I was thinking recently of arguments of
<br />
the sort that seek to refute computationalism as a theory of
<br />
consciousness by contrasting, say, a (however 'complete')
<br />
computational model of digestion with a 'real' stomach digesting
<br />
'real' food.  No one could mistake one for the other, runs the
<br />
argument.  This seems true.  But it occurred to me that it wouldn't
<br />
necessarily be a mistake if 'real' stomachs and 'real' food were
<br />
'computational' too.  IOW, if computation is to be the basis for
<br />
'reality', it must be 'computations all the way down'.  ISTM that the
<br />
UDA demonstrates rigorously the consequences of assuming otherwise,
<br />
and hence is a reductio of 'materialistic computationalism'.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Concerning the math, do you know the book by Torkel Franzen on the uses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and misuses of Godel theorems? Despite some big mistake I will talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about, it is a quite excellent book which I would recommend the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading.
</em><br />
<br />I don't know it, and having perused the Davis book, I suspect it may
<br />
be beyond me without a lot of steering in the right direction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you have a (passive) knowledge of first order logic? Do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see that (with x, y ... belonging to the natural numbers).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (x div y) &lt;-&gt; Ez(x * z = y)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prime(x) &lt;-&gt; (~(x = 1) &amp; Ay((y div x) -&gt; (y = 1 V y = x)))
</em><br />
<br />I have a wiki-aided ('just-in-time') understanding, from which I can
<br />
appreciate the validity of these propositions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Do you have an idea how Godel manages to define in a similar way the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provability predicate in the arithmetical language (= first order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logical language + the symbols =, 0, +, *, s).
</em><br />
<br />It would really help to have the precise steps pointed out.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps you could think of making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some short summary of your points. Your last posts, imo,  were a bit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fuzzy by over-determination, I said even close to the 1004 fallacy ...
</em><br />
<br />I'll try - it may not be until I return from Scotland where I will be
<br />
all of next week.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; What could go possibly wrong in your approach, with respect of comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and/or the lobian interview) is that sometimes I understand that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want that your most primitive element belongs to the first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realm. My problem here is that this is consistent with the comp hyp,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but this consistency is irrelevant as far as we are trying to make a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; communicable and refutable theory.
</em><br />
<br />I think that Plotinus' theology has been helpful for me here in
<br />
distinguishing the 'primitive' as the 'solipsism of the One' rather
<br />
than the 'first person'.  The point here is that there is an
<br />
ineliminable identification of the individual self with the One, in
<br />
the sense of a part being identified with, and deriving its primitive
<br />
characteristics from, the whole of which it is an aspect.  However,
<br />
although the One is (0) 'personal', it is not 'a person': only the
<br />
'parts' are.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This one has to have communicable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or at lest axiomatizable) third person primitive element. The lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;soul&quot; (alias first person or third hypostase) disagrees somehow with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this, but that lobian soul is not completely willing to make science at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the start!
</em><br />
<br />Since communicability and refutability must indeed occur exclusively
<br />
in terms of the third person, this places severe limits on what can be
<br />
'relevant' in this sense.The disagreement, I think, comes from the
<br />
'soul's' intuition that no amount of such third person discourse seems
<br />
to yield an explanation of first person experience as such - only a
<br />
possible justification of the belief in it.  Is it 'unscientific' to
<br />
be dissatisfied with this?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; It's always a pleasure to converse with you on the list, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; certainly agree that we've made some progress towards a clearer

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; consequently

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have a sincere desire to learn more, and particularly to understand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; where I may have gone wrong in my previous ideas.  So it helps me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; greatly to have a correspondent who goes to the trouble first to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understand and clarify what I may have to say, and then to point out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; my errors.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not sure you have been gone wrong anywhere. Sometimes you are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precise enough so that I could compare your talk with the lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine talk. Now, even if you were enough clear so that I could find a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discrepancy between your talk and the machine's one, it would not

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily mean you are wrong: it could mean you are not a lobian

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the comp hyp refutable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You must also realize that the (ideally correct) machine will develop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all the arithmetical points of view, and that there are already a sort

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;  I'll continue to study your papers, to the best of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. Don't hesitate to ask question. I don't mind any question,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including &quot;what are talking about in that or that paragraph&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Do let me know if there's anything I can do to help, list-wise (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other-wise), vis-a-vis your dialogues with the machine (but -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; malhereusement - only in English!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, after the computability meeting in Siena, I have change my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind about Russell Standish idea that &quot;Conscience et Mecanisme&quot; should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be translated in English. It is not at all outdated indeed, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains more than 400 pages just on the Church thesis impact. Comp is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mainly Church thesis (more so when you get the idea that the lobian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interview eliminates almost completely the need for the thought
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences and thus the need of the &quot;yes doctor&quot; hypothesis. I have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; write more paper on Church thesis, or at least consecrate more lines of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanations on that. (Despite people like Emil Post or Judson Webb
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seems to me to have already well understood this quite well, ref in my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thesis).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The other pedagogical problem I have is always the same: is it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasonable to try to explain the lobian interview before a thorough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding of the UDA (or at least the seven first steps). This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes no sense perhaps, except for a pure mathematician.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you understand that the UDA literally gives no choice about what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has to be taken as primitive element for any TOE once we assume the
</em><br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
