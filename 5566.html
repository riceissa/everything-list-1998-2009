</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;         How does indeterminacy and multiple-world-occupation follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     from an inability to deduce that one is not in a simulation?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
The total ignorance (not his inability) of an observer of whether his 
<br />
world is or is not in a simulation effectively places his whole universe 
<br />
in a state of superposition. Equivalently, this observer occupies 
<br />
several worlds some of them in simulators and others not in simulators. 
<br />
This multiplicity of world forms an ensemble of worlds that he occupies. 
<br />
The elements of  the ensemble belong to different levels in a simulation 
<br />
hierarchy. His act of performing a measurement on his world to extract 
<br />
the information he seeks about his world being in a simulator, results 
<br />
in different a outcome in each world in the ensemble. In order for the 
<br />
observer to remain consisten with the world he observes, his states must 
<br />
change accordingly. As a result the states of the observer diverge or 
<br />
&quot;split.&quot; Each world in the ensemble now contains a diffeent observer. 
<br />
Equivalently, each of these observers occupies a much reduce ensemble. 
<br />
Equivalently, each of these observers do not occupy a world in 
<br />
superposition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     It seems to me that if two worlds are indistinguishable from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     point of view of an observer, then the two worlds could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     switched on the observer - or conversely that the observer could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     be teleported from one world to the other - without him knowing it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         The 3rd person abilty to interchange identical worlds does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     not necessitate the a priori existence of a multitute of identical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     worlds from a 1st person point of view, because, as you wrote they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     could be switched without him (the 1st person) knowing it. So why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     entertain their existence in the first place?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
The existence of multiple worlds is a consequence of the principle of 
<br />
sufficient reason as I have explained before. If a world is in a 
<br />
particular state, and there is no reason for it to be in this state, 
<br />
then it must also be in all possible states. By the way this principle 
<br />
has an echo in elementary particle physics. The 3rd person is almost not 
<br />
in my vocabulary except when I talk about first persons who share 
<br />
identical or almost identical frames of references. Therefore I do not 
<br />
quite understand your reference to a 3rd person ability to interchange 
<br />
identical worlds. It just does not make sense to me.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Let us also take into account that the kind of teleportation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     that you bring up here is not physically possible. I do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     understand how it continues to be used as a pedagological device.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Such teleportation would be trivial for creatures living in a simulation 
<br />
or even in the real world when you have a distributed computing 
<br />
capability like the Internet.. Applets are being teleported on the 
<br />
Internet every day. In the future, robots may get to have their software 
<br />
teleported from one machine in Paris to another one in Washington. It 
<br />
just so happen that carbon based creatures using wetware AI cannot be 
<br />
easily teleported.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The existence of many such worlds give rise to Quantum indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         I beg to differ. IIRC, David Deutsch and others have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     repeatedly pointed out that it is the superposition principle of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Quantum Mechanics that implies the existence of &quot;many worlds&quot; not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the prior existence of multiple identical worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
It all depends what your starting axioms are.  As I said my starting 
<br />
axiom is the conscious &quot;I&quot; capable of logic and applying the principle 
<br />
of sufficient reason. BOTH superposition AND the existence of 
<br />
&quot;many-worlds are consequences of this principle.
<br />
<br />Unless you believe in the &quot;I&quot; and that you believe that you are capable 
<br />
of logical thinking, there is absolutely no sane reasoning that you can 
<br />
do. This applies to &quot;David Deutsch and others.&quot; Their reasoning is not 
<br />
wrong, it just starts with one of my theorems.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Measurement only restricts the size of the ensemble.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Are you assuming the &quot;collapse of the wave-function&quot; or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     classical or &quot;ignorance based&quot; interpretation of probabilities here?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Neither. As I have explained above, when an observer exists in two 
<br />
worlds, (or equivalently in a single world in two states of 
<br />
superposition), and this observer makes a measurement, then obviously 
<br />
the measurement will come out differently in each world. The observer's 
<br />
states which must  remain consistent with the world that he observes, 
<br />
must then diverge.) We have now several observers occupying different 
<br />
worlds. The world each observers now occupies is a single world (or 
<br />
equivalently there is no more superposition). Thus there is no collapse 
<br />
but each observer experiences a reduction of the ensemble that he 
<br />
occupies. In addition, this effect is definitely not ignorance-based. 
<br />
The observer can be 100% sure that his world is in superposition. He can 
<br />
be 100% sure that he actually exists in both worlds.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     A creature nominally living in a simulation as observed (3rd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     person) by an experimenter,  lives from the first person point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     view in multiple simulations located at multiple levels.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         It seems to me that you are assuming what I define as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;voyeur's framing&quot; when considering the notion of a simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     That is ok, IHMO, so long as you acknowledge that such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     simulation will involve less computational power that one that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     dissallows for the voyeur's framing. It is like observing the game
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;EverQuest&quot; on your computer monitor.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         When you make this assumption it follows that many -even an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     infinity - of simulated worlds could simultaneously exits, but I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     am arguing that the support for the multitute of identical worlds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     vanishes when we consider the case of the simulation that requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     more computational power than that available to *ANY* observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     that you, from within the simulation, could communicate with. To
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     follow the EverQuest analogy, consider yourself as a NPC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     (non-player character) within the EverQuest &quot;world&quot;. The maximal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     computational power that you would have available would be the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     computational power needed to generate the unfolding of events you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     could observe from a 1st person point of view.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         I argue that we have a similar situation in our &quot;real&quot; world.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     shorter methods of calculation that reproduce the outcome without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     tracing each step. Such shortcuts can be made if the computations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     used in the calculation are more sophisticated than those that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     physical system can itself perform. Any computations must,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     however, be carried out on a computer. But the computer is itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     an example of a physical system. And it can determine the outcome
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of its own evolution only by explicitly following it through: No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     shortcut is possible. Such computational irreducibility occurs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     whenever a physical system can act as a computer. The behavior of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the system can be found only by direct simulation or observation:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     No general predictive procedure is possible.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         I take this reasoning and invert to to argue that what we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     experience as &quot;reality&quot; is indistinguishable from a simulation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     the world using the most computational power available, the latter
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     being the world as a physical system, acting as a computer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     computing its own evolution. What we take as a 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;reality&quot; is nothing more than the best possible simulation. My
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     rubric is: if we cannot 1st person distiguish between a &quot;real&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     object and a simulated object, there is no difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I am not sure if I understand your above paragraphs, but I may agree 
<br />
with them
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [GL]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     This can easily be proven. If the experimenter pull the plug the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     creature continues living somewhere/when else in the ensemble.  So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     if living in a simulator is indistinguishable with not living in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     simulator, then the world is in a superposition of states. Ergo
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     multiple world and indeterminacy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         No, that does not follow because the premise is flawed! The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     ability to &quot;pull the plug&quot; necessitates access to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     computational resources that go into the generation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     simulation and this is not 1st person possible, as I point out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     above. You seem to be conflating the 3rd person &quot;voyeur framing&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     of an experimentor &quot;outside&quot; of the machine tinkering with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     computation itslef and that of the creature existing within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     simulation, having a 1st person experience of a &quot;reality&quot; that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     cannot prove is or is not a simulation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Let me rephrase: So if living in a simulator is indistinguishable for 
<br />
any creature with a first person perspective, with not living in a 
<br />
simulator, then the world is in a superposition of states for that 
<br />
creature. Ergo multiple world at multiple level of implementation and 
<br />
indeterminacy. Computation speed has nothing to do with it. One 
<br />
implementation could have a one nanosecond clock and the other one a one 
<br />
billion year clock. Consciousness will span these implementations 
<br />
forward in time, backward in time as long as the transitions from one 
<br />
conscious state to another are consistent from one to the next. When you 
<br />
look at it this way, you don't even need &quot;worlds&quot; any more. All you need 
<br />
is to consider is that consciousness surfs the plenitude itself. You can 
<br />
compose a coherent message by going to a library and selecting a 
<br />
sequence of  words from various books. eg: Hamlet word #201, A Tale of 
<br />
Two Cities word #5469, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone word #5892, 
<br />
.... The point is that you don't really need the books anymore. All you 
<br />
need is a big pile of words that you could obtain by shredding the 
<br />
books. The &quot;classical&quot; world is only an illusion created by the 
<br />
consistency requirement of the observer.
<br />
<br />So in my opinion, the term Many-World is really a misnomer. There is 
<br />
only one world: the Plenitude.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     [SPK]    Also, how is multiple-world-occupation knowable 1st

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         How is the anthropic principle consistent with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     simultaneous co-existence of 1st person experiences, e.g. the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     situation where Identical creatures have different 1st person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     experiences simultaneously?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
I don't see how identical creature can have different first person 
<br />
experience and still be consistent with their world, unless you are 
<br />
willing to allow some uncertainty in how you define &quot;identical&quot; creature 
<br />
and/or &quot;different&quot; experiences.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;         If we are considering the case of many identical observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     having identical 1st person experiences, I argue that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     existence of more than one observer X and 1st person experience A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     pair, {X, A}, only follows from the postulation of a secondary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     observer of {X, A}_i; where i can be more than 1. My symbols might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     be malformed here so I beg your indulgence. ;-)   
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Does that help?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Kindest regards,

<br /><br />A joke I picked up on the web. It reminds me of the Anthropic Principle.
<br />
<br />A couple of blondes are lost in the mall. So they go to the nearest mall 
<br />
map where they see a red dot with the words, &quot;YOU ARE HERE.&quot;
<br />
<br />One blonde looks at the other and exclaims, &quot;Wow! How do they know that?&quot;
<br />
