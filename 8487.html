<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You cannot affect your intelligence. You are stuck with it. It is the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure of the speed at which neurons in your brain fire and receive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; impulses.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;From your post I see we agree on many things and I don't need to add 
<br />
comments, except on this quoted sentence and similar below. I don't 
<br />
think we are stuck with our intelligence (in the general sense which we 
<br />
are opposing to competence). Actually I would say that the speed of 
<br />
processing is more on the side of competence than intelligence 
<br />
(although I.J. Good makes an interesting analysis of &quot;free-will&quot; in 
<br />
term of processing speed). Remember I am used to get conversation in 
<br />
Platonia with Platonic machine which in general are very slow (because 
<br />
there is no need to optimize them given that in Platonia we have &quot;all 
<br />
the time&quot;). I think intelligence, again in that large sense of just an 
<br />
ability of doubting, is very close to courage, and is perhaps just a 
<br />
matter of attitude. I do think people can get it in one second, but 
<br />
also to loose it in one second. Generally this happens after some 
<br />
shock, like when a people you care about dies or when yourself have 
<br />
some accident or anything which can quickly make fragile some of your 
<br />
oldest prejudice.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Competence is dynamic / intelligence is a frozen quantity of something
</em><br />
<br />Same remark. I do think that &quot;intelligence&quot; is the normal state of any 
<br />
(naive) self-introspective machine. Pain, disease, problematic parents, 
<br />
problematic social neighborhoods, lack of education etc. all those 
<br />
rather banal life circumstances can destroy it for a time. And the same 
<br />
things can also re-awake it (if that is still english).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; My favorite definition of ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ... is that thing that once you give it/he/she/e a name or a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; description, then you can say &quot;hello&quot; to the catastrophes ....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Ain't it &quot;the truth&quot;!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is also surely because &quot;the truth&quot; is a con job. Truth or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *identity* - which is what you are talking about here - is often the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place at which all movement in thinking ceases. Once you name 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something you have slapped a label on it and labels tend to be sticky 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things in the warm, spongey human brain.
</em><br />
<br />Yes. And the story of humanity is full of examples. Now it is hard, at 
<br />
least for me, not to point toward the basic theorems of mathematical 
<br />
logic in this setting. Tarski theorem: sound löbian machines cannot 
<br />
name their truth predicate. Gödel's incompleteness theorem: sound 
<br />
lobian machine cannot prove their own consistency. Now, the lobian 
<br />
machines, which are just the self-referentially correct machine having 
<br />
enough introspective power, can prove their Godel's theorem, and so 
<br />
they can know that if they are consistent they can be inconsistent, and 
<br />
that is a logical reason for doubting, and that's why I think to be 
<br />
intelligent is the natural state of a machine, and thus loosing that 
<br />
intelligence is (alas) also natural. It is like to be alive: to be 
<br />
alive *is* to be able to die.
<br />
<br />Dt -&gt; DBf, to sum up. And that formula characterizes the multiverse 
<br />
where all transient observer-moment can reach dead-ends. Will come back 
<br />
to this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientists should stay well clear of truth. Mathematicians own it.
</em><br />
<br />A scientist has the right to search for the truth, and even to say so. 
<br />
But he can never be sure it owns it. I'm not sure mathematicians own 
<br />
it, except perhaps for a tiny part of math, but then everyone owns that 
<br />
part (except highly disabled person).
<br />
