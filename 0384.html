<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there are plenty of people who would object at this point and say that

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about where to draw the line.  I think there is a deep reason, but I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not able to explain it in words.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is your responsibility to explain and justify your intuition.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can't continue this discussion if you are going to appeal to an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intuition that only you have access to.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd hardly say that only I have access to it, since there are a
<br />
lot of computationalists around.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It applies both ways.  I do agree that it's not the sort of
<br />
thing we can expect to resolve.  Like reductionism vs. dualism, there are
<br />
always going to be disagreements, I think.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Of course your way has rather counterintuitive consequences which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computationalism avoids.  The recently dead, for example, could have about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; as much measure in your scheme as the living, since the brain would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about the same chemical structure but would no longer compute.  What do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; you think it would feel like to be such a consciousness?  I doubt it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; feel like anything, but that's just a restatement of my above position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It doesn't feel like anything because consciousness depends on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structure of neuron firing patterns. Since the brain-dead have no brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity they obviously lack this structure. I don't see how this is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem for my proposal.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very likely telltale signs that a neuron has recently
<br />
been firing, which is just as good in your proposal.  But suppose it's an
<br />
AI with non-volatile memory.  It would still have experiences when turned
<br />
off, or just stored on a CD, in your proposal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	I doubt that.  Remember, in these artificial neural nets, brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; size is already present (easy to make em' big).  All that remains is for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; them to start exploiting the niche of intelligence, and since it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have advantages, it should be a fairly steady and stable progression,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with plenty of time to let it happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not convinced that if you add in the code for evolving the neural nets
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (what are you going to replace DNA, proteins, etc. with?) and simulating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the external environment (what environment are you going to use?), and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interfacing the neural nets with the external environment, that it's going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be shorter than the program form I proposed. But I agree that without a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more authoratative estimate this discussion probably won't get very far.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You obviously don't need to replace proteins and DNA, just the
<br />
neural net.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where are we going to get that authoritative estimate?  I don't
<br />
really know any computer scientists, though NYU has them of course.  It
<br />
would have to be someone interested, but not so interested as to take sides.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	That doesn't make much sense to me.  If there's something that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; it's like to be a string, why should that be ruined just because it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; surrounded by other strings?  There are no external observers here, just 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; internal observers.  Is your idea that the concious part of the tape must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be printed out at the beginning of the tape?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why should it be ruined if it's interspersed with a 0 every other bit? Why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should it be ruined if it is intermingled with this other string in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular way? But notice that in all three cases you're introducing new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information that is not present in the original string, namely the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; algorithm for extracting the substring from the original string. Clearly a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; line has to be drawn somewhere and the natural place to draw it is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disallow any extra information. Thus a substring cannot be conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it is not a self-contained carrier of information, and it can only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be made into one by the introduction of new information.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I'm not seeing it the same way as you.  You still have not
<br />
answered my question: are you proposing that the program must print out
<br />
the conscious part of the string at the beginning of the tape, then erase 
<br />
the rest of the program?  Otherwise it is still a substring.  What about
<br />
the fact that it is surrounded by other bits in the orthogonal direction
<br />
from the other Turing machines?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a computation was interspersed with 0 at every other bit, it
<br />
would still be implemented.  This is exactly the sort of question the
<br />
implementation criterion will solve.  In my proposal, it would still be
<br />
implemented because the shortest program that could label the bits used
<br />
would still label them in the same order.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see why it's more problematic with just strings, since you
<br />
no longer have the requirement of causal relationships which greatly
<br />
constrains what mappings can be considered for computations.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; That is not the model I have in mind. It doesn't seem sensible to think of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; a universe with a continuous infinity of Turing machines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 	Why not?  The set of all possible programs - what could be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; natural than that?  It seems closest to Max's 'everything' idea as well.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry, I was wrong. It's not insensible to think of a universe with a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continuous infinity of Turing machines. All you need is a three
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dimensional Turing machine and a universe with four spacial dimensions.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's a mysterious remark.  All I need is what I suggested, which
<br />
if you like amounts to a universe with one continuous spactial dimension,
<br />
one discrete spactial dimension, and one discrete time dimension.
<br />
(Assuming the heads' internal variables are not counted.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless, the point remains that it's more natural to start out
<br />
with all possible programs than it is to 'clone' the machines and add
<br />
extra tape at each time step.
