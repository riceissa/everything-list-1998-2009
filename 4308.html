<br />
Dear Stephen,
<br />
<br />When you say:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [...]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We might not be able to know &quot;what it is like to be a bat&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but surely we could &quot;know what it is like to be an ameoba&quot;!
</em><br />
<br />It is amusing because I describe often---for exemple my thesis
<br />
or <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3651.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m3651.html</a>--- my whole
<br />
work as an attempt to know what it is like to be an amoeba.
<br />
In my thesis I express myself exactly like that.
<br />
I am thinking for sure to a self-dividing amoeba, and that's what
<br />
has lead me to the comp indeterminacy.
<br />
Frankly if you know what it does look like to be an amoeba,
<br />
even in between self-divisions, you should try to describe it!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bruno, I am still not convinced that the statements that &quot;If 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we are consistent machine we cannot know which machine we are&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and &quot;Godel's and Lob's incompleteness prevent us to identify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;any intuitive first person knowledge with objective third person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;communicable statements&quot; mutes my question since it seems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it makes my predicament much worse! It seems that your idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;prevents me from &quot;knowing what it is like to be a bat&quot; by not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;allowing me to have any 1-person certainty at all.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I don't see why. You can still have a lot of 1-person certainties.
<br />
It is just that 'knowing which machine you are' is not among them.
<br />
But you can keep the 1-certainty that 1+1 = 2, or that there is no
<br />
integers p and q such that p/q = sqrt(2), etc.
<br />
You can *bet* that you are well defined at such or such level of
<br />
description, but you cannot consistently assert you can prove
<br />
being well-defined at those levels. (A non-computationalist just
<br />
pretend that there are no such levels, not even the quantum one
<br />
because the quantum level is emulable classicaly).
<br />
<br />All what follows from Godel in this setting is that you cannot 
<br />
consistently ascribe univocally a well defined machine to your
<br />
1-person experience. Once you bet on a level, you can ascribe 
<br />
to your experience an infinite vague sets of machines, though. 
<br />
Those machines are going through an infinite vague set of 
<br />
histories. I should have said perhaps that
<br />
you cannot know *precisely* which machine you are.
<br />
<br />(Z1* should provide, by construction, the geometry of that vagueness).
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Bruno
