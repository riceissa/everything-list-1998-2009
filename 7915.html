<br />
&nbsp;Good heavens! How many times must it be said? What is going on
<br />
&nbsp;with people? There is a *clear* definition of &quot;naive realism&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;Try the almost always extremely reliable wikipedia:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_realism">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_realism</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;If one is very clear that information about events outside
<br />
&nbsp;the skin is conveyed to one's brain by layers of intermediate
<br />
&nbsp;processes, (usually beginning with emissions of photons or by
<br />
&nbsp;vibrations imparted to air), then you are *not* a naive realist.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;My, are prickly today!!! In this is when I was still sympathizing with 
<br />
you! (;-)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[LC]
<br />
&nbsp;Since this has come up so many times before---and not just on this
<br />
&nbsp;list---I'm really starting to wonder what the explanation is. You
<br />
&nbsp;can even find links on the web that confuse realism and naive
<br />
&nbsp;realism.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;The acid test of what to call something is &quot;do the adherents of
<br />
&nbsp;the view themselves use the term?&quot;. Then, in cases like this,
<br />
&nbsp;we see it for what it is: name calling.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Hold on! I don't believe I have even called you a &quot;naive realist&quot;!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; and agree entirely with your opinion on the demerits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; of introspection. I have to take issue with half of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; what you say below:
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[LC]
<br />
&nbsp;Of course. Anyone who understands and believes in
<br />
&nbsp;PCR always invites criticism, as least as much as
<br />
&nbsp;he has time for.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; I'm not too sure what you mean by &quot;to embed&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; If we are seeking to *explain*---if that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; what you mean---then we cannot explain QM by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; classical physics, but we *can* explain classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; physics by QM. (I take our primary activity to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; be---and the activity I'm most interesting in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; participating in---*explaining*.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Yes we cannot explain QM by classical physics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; but NEITHER can we explain from QM the classical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; world we know and love with its well defined and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; assigned elements of (naive) physical reality
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; that you so much cherish, I am afraid! If we did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; there would not be no Measurement Problem, no spooky
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; long-distance correlations, no zombie Schrodinger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Cat's around to haunt us...
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;Quantum mechanics' greatest successes have included
<br />
&nbsp;explanations for what you cite. That is why QM is
<br />
&nbsp;accepted.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;My point is that it does NOT include explanations for
<br />
&nbsp;any of the items I cite and that is why I cite them
<br />
&nbsp;and that is why they are called &quot;problems&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;From Bruno's message I take it that you subscribe to the
<br />
&nbsp;Everett Interpretation which indeed &quot;avoids&quot; some of these
<br />
&nbsp;problems but has some more of its own and
<br />
&nbsp;surely does a number on your &quot;naive reality&quot;!
<br />
&nbsp;What is it then: many worlds or one?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[LC]
<br />
&nbsp;But you seem to be saying that the *correct* results
<br />
&nbsp;of classical physics cannot be obtained from QM. Surely
<br />
&nbsp;you don't mean that. Of course they can! If they could
<br />
&nbsp;not, then they'd be wrong!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;True, classical physics *cannot* explain many phenomena,
<br />
&nbsp;such as why black bodies radiate the way that they do,
<br />
&nbsp;and this bothered 19th century physicist a great deal.
<br />
&nbsp;Planck was *forced* to come up with the concept of the
<br />
&nbsp;quantum, if he was to be able to explain.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;No, I am not saying that QM does not reproduce much of
<br />
&nbsp;the classical results given the appropriate limits. Indeed it can
<br />
&nbsp;and it, furthermore, predicts and explains a number of
<br />
&nbsp;macroscopic (thus part of the world of direct experience)
<br />
&nbsp;phenomena that Classical Physics does not.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;What I am saying above (and this is the clincher of the EPR argument
<br />
&nbsp;as is that of the Everett interpretation) is that QM does not provide
<br />
&nbsp;you with a picture of a reality where objects naively have their
<br />
&nbsp;well defined properties associated with assignable elements
<br />
&nbsp;of physical reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1"> &gt; You see, amplitudes don't just add! They also multiply
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; and square!
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;[LC]
<br />
&nbsp;Why, of course. Just how innocent of QM do you suppose
<br />
&nbsp;that I am? I invented the phrase &quot;at the basis of things
<br />
&nbsp;are amplitudes that add&quot; after a thorough study of Feynman's
<br />
&nbsp;volume 3. The multiplication obtains---at the very beginning
<br />
&nbsp;---simply from concatenating paths: you multiply amplitudes
<br />
&nbsp;to get a total amplitude for one path.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;If that sentence is any measure of your &quot;guilt&quot; that you will
<br />
&nbsp;be doing &quot;quantum time&quot;, Lee (:-) What you want to say
<br />
&nbsp;is &quot;at the basis of QM there are amplitudes that add, multiply
<br />
&nbsp;and square&quot;. Notice the absence of &quot;things&quot;! It is the
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;things&quot; that ain't there!!!
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[LC]
<br />
&nbsp;Your point about the squared modulus is well taken. Just why
<br />
&nbsp;*probabilities* emerge from squared amplitudes, I couldn't
<br />
&nbsp;tell you. I'm not sure that anyone knows---as I recall, many
<br />
&nbsp;this is related to the basis problem of the MWI (though
<br />
&nbsp;Deutsch and others say that decoherence takes care of
<br />
&nbsp;everything, though).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Lee
<br />
<br />&nbsp;[GK]
<br />
&nbsp;Wouldn't that be nice! Unfortunately they are wrong about
<br />
&nbsp;that. Decoherence is promising but still in need of major
<br />
&nbsp;patching. Check out the paper by Bassi and Ghiraridi:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912031">http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9912031</a>
<br />
<br />&nbsp;There is some newer work on this by Adrian Kent but I
<br />
&nbsp;don't have the reference handy. As to why the amplitudes
<br />
&nbsp;square to give probabilities I agree with you that no one knows!
<br />

<br />
