<br />Very nice and very pedagogical paper. I disagree with 
<br />
the philosophy, though.
<br />
<br />(I like also a lot the FOR book, I find the argument for the multiverse
<br />
convincing and I share Deutsch's appreciation for Popper, but there too
<br />
I am not convinced by the philosophy. In particular I disagree with
<br />
Deutsch's view on Church's thesis).
<br />
<br />Here I will make short remarks on the abstract and about the beginning
<br />
of the paper *Machines, Logic and Quantum Physics* by DEL.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Abstract: Though the truths of logic and pure mathematics are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective and independent of any contingent facts or laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature, ...
</em><br />
<br />I agree, but when DEL add:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;our knowledge of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;these truths depends entirely on our knowledge of the laws of physics.
</em><br />
<br />I could have agree with the idea that our knowledge of these truth
<br />
depends on the laws of physics, but I don't understand how 
<br />
our knowledge of these truth could depend on *our knowledge* of the laws 
<br />
of physics. Indeed most elementary truth in math has evolved independently
<br />
of our knowledge of physics. And it seems also that the knowledge
<br />
of *modern physics* depends on our knowledge of mathematics. It is a little
<br />
like to say that to understand Pythagore's theorem you need to understand
<br />
quantum mechanics. It is the contrary IMHO. Although I agree there are
<br />
strong evidence that my brain obeys Schroedinger Equation, I don't need 
<br />
to be able to solve Schr. Eq. for using my brain. I don't even need 
<br />
to know I have a brain.
<br />
<br />Now it happens that I do not even believe that our knowledge of these 
<br />
logical and mathematical truth depends on the laws of physics. 
<br />
I am defending the quite opposite thesis, mainly
<br />
that the laws of physics depends on the knowledgeability of these logical
<br />
and mathematical truth.
<br />
<br />I manage to show that  by a kind of arithmetical &quot;turing-tropic&quot; principle 
<br />
in my thesis <a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal</a>
<br />
<br />I quote the beginning of DEL's paper *Machines, Logic and 
<br />
Quantum Physics*:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Genuine scientific knowledge cannot be certain, ...
</em><br />
<br />I agree. Even logic and math cannot give
<br />
certain knowledge, as Descartes realises a long time ago.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ..., nor can it be justified a priori.
</em><br />
<br />Why ?
<br />
<br />This is a pessimistic axiom. If this was true, there would be
<br />
no hopes explaining the very existence of the ``empirical world&quot;.
<br />
That principle forces us to take that existence for granted.
<br />
I don't see any logical or empirical reason to do that. 
<br />
<br />It is quite (logically) possible (consistent) that someone
<br />
find an a priori axiom (perhaps inspired by physical observation)
<br />
and derive from it a new sort of realm from which he is able to 
<br />
explain the origin of the physical laws. And, as Wheeler makes it
<br />
clear in his ``law without law&quot;, such realm cannot be physical
<br />
(if not we face an infinite regress).
<br />
<br />Well. That is what I have done in my thesis. And other people
<br />
like Tegmark, Schmidhuber, Jacques Mallah, Hal Finney, James
<br />
Higgo, Chris Malloney, Russell Standish, and many others
<br />
&nbsp;are yet searching such realms and justifications:
<br />
see <a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/</a>
<br />
<br />I know that David Deutsch critisizes Wheeler's idea (that physics
<br />
is not fundamental after all!) in his paper 
<br />
``On Wheeler's notion of 'Law without Law' in Physics&quot;,
<br />
Deutsch, D., Foundations of Physics, Vol. 16, N° 6, pp. 565-572, 1986.
<br />
<br />But, quasi explicitly, Deutsch imposes the fundamental nature
<br />
of physics. Another misleading idea is his maintaining that mathematical
<br />
truth are analytical. But since the Godelian failure of logicism,
<br />
this is not tenable. Even the simple axioms of elementary arithmetics
<br />
need some form of non trivial introspection.
<br />
<br />The DEL paper extends in some way Landauer's idea that
<br />
information is physical. (Why don't you refer to it?).
<br />
<br />In my thesis I show that 
<br />
<br />1) if we are Turing emulable (it is the
<br />
computationalist hypothesis in psychology) then physics
<br />
*must* be derivable from the psychology of machines via
<br />
computer science and self-reference logic; and 
<br />
<br />2) I illustrate a beginning of such 
<br />
a derivation of physics (in the chapter 5).
<br />
<br />Only if we are *not* Turing emulable (that is not even quantum
<br />
turing emulable!) are DEL's conclusion consistent.
<br />
<br />Physics must be informatical or computationalism (which is explicitly
<br />
postulate by David Deutsch) should be false.
