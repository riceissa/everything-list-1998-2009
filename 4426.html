Regarding the question of scientific paradigms, the cyclic-universe paper
<br />
I mentioned a few days ago made an interesting point.  The paper may be
<br />
found at <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0204479">http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0204479</a>.
<br />
<br />The main author, Paul Steinhardt, is a successful physicist who has done
<br />
a great deal of original work in conventional cosmology, particularly
<br />
inflation theory.  (Inflation is the theory that the universe expanded
<br />
extremely quickly at an early stage, which helps to explain why the
<br />
larger universe is as uniform as it is seen to be.)  Steinhardt now
<br />
presents what may strike many physicists as an exotic, even &quot;oddball&quot;
<br />
theory which denies the existence of inflation, one of the cornerstones
<br />
of modern cosmology.  In his second paragraph he takes pains to show
<br />
the promise of his new theory:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new type of cosmological
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;model - not a variant of an older model, but, a genuinely new
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cosmological framework.  This new paradigm turns cosmic history
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;topsy-turvy.  And yet, as you will see, it is able to reproduce all
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the successful predictions of the consesnsus model with the same
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exquisite detail.  Perhaps you will even conclude that the cyclic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universe accomplishes the feat more economically.
<br />
<br />Later in the paper he indirectly comments on the difficulty he knows he
<br />
faces in persuading people to give the new theory a fair hearing:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cyclic model could have been proposed at the same time as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inflation, in which case it would have been interesting to see which
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proposal would have emerged as the more appealing idea.  As it is,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cyclic model has arrived twenty years late, after cosmologists
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have become attached to the inflationary paradign, so there can be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no fair measure.
<br />
<br />Let me say first that, although I am no physicist, I think Steinhardt
<br />
is somewhat over-selling his theory here.  There were a number of holes
<br />
in the picture where he promised that ongoing work was showing excellent
<br />
signs of filling in these remaining details.  But still, inflation has 20
<br />
years of testing, development and refinement behind it.  His new theory
<br />
really cannot be said to be quite on the same firm footing as inflation.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless, he has a point, which is that to some extent in science
<br />
the historical accident of which theory comes first may be influential
<br />
in terms of the theory becoming better accepted.  It will be interesting
<br />
to see how Steinhardt's cyclic model fares vis a vis inflation, if both
<br />
models truly do turn out to explain the observations equally well.
