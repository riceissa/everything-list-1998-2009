</em><br />
<br />I haven't had a chance to explore RS's book yet, but I can share the
<br />
simple way that I unite nothing and infinity in my own book which is I
<br />
suppose is fundamentally about nothing and everything.
<br />
<br />There is a real existing &quot;nothing&quot; and there is a concept nonexistence
<br />
and they should never be confused. The real nothing is common,
<br />
&quot;nothing in the refrigerator&quot;, a white canvas, empty space (the ideal
<br />
or direction toward i.e., expansion). The real nothing is simply
<br />
balance, uniformity, perfect symmetry. It isn't a cancellation of
<br />
properties or existence, it is a unification or synthesis into a
<br />
single form, which we see as nothing. Cook everything in the frig
<br />
together and you end up with one thing with far fewer properties. That
<br />
property-less &quot;one&quot; in mathematics is zero. In a simple examination of
<br />
zero it appears to contain all other numbers, as x + -x equals zero.
<br />
However, zero mathematically refers to &quot;no things&quot; or cancellation,
<br />
and so we say the sum of all reals is indefinite. However, as I
<br />
explain in my book there are two mathematical systems not one. It is
<br />
all or nothing. Zero can either represents no things, or zero
<br />
represents all things. If zero is all things, zero becomes infinite,
<br />
and as a result all numbers become infinite. +1 becomes all numbers
<br />
except -1 is excluded, etc etc. Suddenly instead of counting things,
<br />
numbers represents fragments of the everything of zero. The radical
<br />
consequence of this is that the value or content of numbers decreases
<br />
rather than increases. Five is a larger infinity than four, since more
<br />
has been removed, it is a smaller fragment of the whole of a zero
<br />
everything. 5 billion is a much smaller value and as we count into
<br />
greater numerals our value or content is decreasing and even
<br />
converging toward an infinitely small value. What we are doing is
<br />
fragmenting zero, we are slicing it up into parts, and since our
<br />
numerical value is converging rather than diverging we can recognize a
<br />
smallest number, positive infinity, an exact division or fragmentation
<br />
made of zero, which in this system is an actual value, no less
<br />
definite and completed than the whole of zero, and so this infinity
<br />
not merely a never ending or unlimited process. I call this number
<br />
Proto, and the negative Elea. So where we are used to not having a
<br />
mathematical value to represent everything, and used to being caught
<br />
up in incomprehensible indefinite infinities, in this math the overall
<br />
infinity of mathematical values is bounded by extremes. There is an
<br />
all positive half, an all negative half, and the whole of zero. In the
<br />
same way there exists infinite fractions between zero and one, this
<br />
math system is infinite yet bounded by extremes, and note there is no
<br />
nothing in this system, or rather nothing and everything are the same
<br />
thing...zero.
<br />
<br />My cosmological application of this system is that Proto, I claim, is
<br />
the infinitely dense (all positive) and infinitely small singularity
<br />
in our past, the extreme of all positive, and the pendulum swung all
<br />
the way to one side. (In this second system there cannot be a value
<br />
smaller than half of the whole, yet that smallest value is still
<br />
infinite). The zero of this math, or Omega, is the singularity of
<br />
empty space toward which our universe is currently accelerating
<br />
towards. It is the largest value in nature, and why the universe
<br />
expands and ultimate ends as a perfectly flat space extending
<br />
infinitely in all directions (perfect symmetry).
<br />
<br />The most dramatic consequence of all this being the realization that
<br />
our universe is not simply becoming disordered, our universe is not
<br />
dying, rather time evolves away from one kind of order (the ultimate
<br />
grouping of all positive apart from all negative, with each having
<br />
high symmetry internally while relative to zero they are perfect
<br />
asymmetry) and time evolves towards a whole other kind of order
<br />
(unity, balance, perfect symmetry) which is actually the infinite
<br />
whole, a quantum superposition of all universes, matter and antimatter
<br />
worlds, antimatter worlds being those that travel from negative Elea
<br />
to zero.
<br />
<br />So as to why we exist rather than nothing at all, the answer is that
<br />
nothing still exists. What we think of as nothing is really
<br />
everything, and zero is the native state of being, as non-being or
<br />
nonexistence cannot &quot;be&quot; (Parmenides). It simply is. We are inside the
<br />
real nothing, inside zero. Ordinary math is based upon the order of
<br />
the past, the distinction and form that results of slicing zero up,
<br />
with Proto claiming to be the great 1, the beginning, everything that
<br />
matters, more than zero. This second system, which I call symmetry
<br />
math, is certainly less functional in our everyday lives, but it is
<br />
less of an abstraction of true reality, and applies much more
<br />
effectively to cosmology, the study of the whole.
