<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;I think that if it is given that either you or your duplicate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;must die, then you should willingly sacrifice yourself if it will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;enrich your duplicate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Either way, I think you wake up the next morning very satisfied
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;with the outcome.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How do you wake up the next morning if you're the one who died? Unless 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can effect some sort of mind merge just before dying, you lose all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiences that you have had since you and your duplicate diverged...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, Stathis, for heaven's sake!  You've already admitted that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;little memory loss does not threaten your identity!  Recall the Aussies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you wrote about who customarily lose an entire evening's inebriation :-)
</em><br />
<br />Yes, and I also admitted that there is an inconsistency in my position. 
<br />
Having my duplicate who has already diverged live on while I die is not just 
<br />
memory loss, but rather replacement of the lost memories with someone 
<br />
else's, which I feel is a greater threat to my identity and which I would be 
<br />
less likely to agree to. Memory loss would be more like having myself backed 
<br />
up and the backup run after I have died. If the backups are frequent, I 
<br />
suppose it is better than no backup at all, but I would still feel afraid of 
<br />
dying. At its most basic, for me anyway, the fear of imminent death is the 
<br />
fear that the person I am *now* will be wiped from the universe and never 
<br />
have any more experiences. The same consideration ought to apply to memory 
<br />
loss, but people don't generally think of it that way, because they know 
<br />
that they'll be OK afterwards, on the basis of past experience.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So remember: your duplicate in the next room is *exactly* in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same state you are in right now if you lose a little recent memory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and then have some new experiences that are identical to his over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the last few minutes. So he *is* you!  That's what I mean when I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;say that we must regard duplicates as selves.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And let's go back to this crazy &quot;transfer&quot; that seems (from my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;viewpoint) to occupy the attention of those who believe in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;continuers&quot;.  So you expect to be the person who arrives at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the other end if you are disintegrated here and teleported
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there. You even expect to be him if the original here is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not disintegrated.  (Here I must lash out at the bizarre
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability calculus that ensues for many at this point:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether or not they *are* the remote version seems to depend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on what happens locally here. Sheese.)
</em><br />
<br />There is a transfer of information in order to effect the teleportation, but 
<br />
this is just a technical detail; there is no actual &quot;transfer&quot; of identity, 
<br />
if that is what you meant. There are only people's beliefs and memories 
<br />
concerning who they are and who they were, coupled with the fact that human 
<br />
minds can only experience being one person at a time. As for how what 
<br />
happens here can affect whether or not the person entering the teleporter 
<br />
finds himself over there: if you destructively teleport an apple there, 
<br />
there is a 100% chance that the apple is over there; whereas if you 
<br />
non-destructively teleport an apple there, choosing an apple at random 
<br />
because you are only allowed one apple at a time, there is a 50% chance it 
<br />
will be the one here and a 50% chance it will be the one there. Where's the 
<br />
problem?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So if all the 1000 Stathis's in the various rooms are to die
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but one, then that one &quot;continues&quot; all the others. Now we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;play a trick. The 1000 don't actually die but are placed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instantaneous suspended animation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Oops!  The big Bean-Counter Upstairs who keeps track of where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the serial numbers go is confused!  He had better have all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1000 Stathis's continue in the one, just in case something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;goes wrong with the suspended animation machinery.  But then...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what to do when nothing goes wrong?  How to send all the souls
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;back into the original bodies???  (Of course, here in this paragraph
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am just attempting to ridicule a point of view in which I do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe. The truth is, of course, is that no &quot;transfers&quot; take place,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the whole idea of a &quot;continuer&quot; is wrong.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you believe that the 1000 will continue in the one (what, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wonder, with probability 1000?), then they'll &quot;continue&quot; in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one whether or not they're disintegrated.
</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I don't understand what you're saying here. Do you mean that 1000 
<br />
versions of me are running in parallel and all but one are stopped or 
<br />
suspended? It's obvious to me that however often the number running is 
<br />
changed, I won't be able to tell that there is any difference. This wouldn't 
<br />
work if they had serial numbers because if each version knew his number, 
<br />
they would start to diverge, and stopping one of them would then lead to the 
<br />
loss of unique experience, as discussed above (you might say it doesn't 
<br />
matter if it's something as trivial as a serial number, like losing a second 
<br />
of memory, but the point still stands). It wouldn't work if they had souls 
<br />
either, because killing some of them, even if they remained running in 
<br />
parallel, would send the souls to heaven or hell or wherever souls go, so 
<br />
again there would be a difference. It only works if they are running in 
<br />
parallel, no serial numbers and no souls. It seems either you have 
<br />
misunderstood my point or I have misunderstood your point.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;And what about this, as a further attack on the probability idea:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;We start with 1000 Stathis's in 1000 hotel rooms, all happily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;looking forward to the afternoon. Then during 1 millisecond all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but one are killed off, and in the next millisecond the random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one who survived is copied into the remaining 999 hotel rooms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suppose---if you believe in that silly probability thing---
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you figure your odds (as a particular person, say in room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;506) as being 1 in 1000.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:-)  Then let whole scenario repeat every 50th of a second,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and pretty soon your odds of surviving are less than one in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a billion???
</em><br />
<br />I am certain to survive (from my point of view) with the experiment as 
<br />
written, because the copies have no time to diverge. The problem arises when 
<br />
each of the 1000 copies has time to think, &quot;Oh no! I'm going to die!&quot; Let's 
<br />
say the cycle repeats every minute rather than in milliseconds. After 
<br />
several cycles, I am almost certain to experience this feeling of impending 
<br />
doom and then die. However, one version of me will always survive, and at 
<br />
the end of the experiment this version will recall being afraid he was going 
<br />
to die but not, of course, actually dying. As discussed above, this version 
<br />
could be considered the continuer of any of the versions who died, but with 
<br />
memory loss/ replacement. This example reminds me of the thought experiment 
<br />
you proposed in an earlier post, where your bank balance increases by $1000 
<br />
every day in return for allowing yourself to be tortured every night, and 
<br />
then having your memory of the experience wiped. If you have gone through 
<br />
several cycles of this you might stop worrying about it, but at night, 
<br />
between the screams, you will be cursing yourself for agreeing to such a 
<br />
stupid and horrible deal. In the current experiment, fear of death takes the 
<br />
place of physical torture.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No:  we have to accept the simple solution I suggest: you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your duplicates, near and far, future and past, whether or not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your instance is collecting memories of their own particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;locales. A few minutes', or even a few months', worth of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memories doesn't really matter much so far as SURVIVAL is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;concerned. This is simple, and it seems to me, obviously true.
</em><br />
<br />I concede that the memory loss/ death equivalence issue gives rise to an 
<br />
inconsistency on my part. I could fix that by either saying that any degree 
<br />
of memory loss is as bad as dying, or else agree that a backup copy allows 
<br />
you to survive death if it isn't too old. The latter solution seems more 
<br />
practical, but is less elegant as it requires an arbitrary definition of 
<br />
what &quot;too old&quot; means. I don't think it would do if a version of yourself as 
<br />
an infant was the only backup copy available to you, for example.
