<br />
Suppose there are only two logically possible deterministic universes A
<br />
and B, and you know that A has measure 0.9, and B has measure 0.1. Suppose
<br />
that until time T the history of these two universes are identical. At
<br />
time T an experiment will be done in both universes. In universe A the
<br />
outcome of the experiment will be &quot;a&quot;, and in universe B the outcome will
<br />
be &quot;b&quot;. If before time T you were given an opportunity to bet $10 that the
<br />
outcome is &quot;a&quot; at 1:1 odds, so that in universe A you would gain $10, and
<br />
in universe B you would lose $10, Would you take the bet?
<br />
<br />The standard answer is yes, you should take it because A has greater
<br />
measure. But that assumes you care more about universes that have greater
<br />
measure than universes that have less measure. But you could say that you
<br />
don't care about what happens in universe A, only about what happens in
<br />
universe B, in which case you wouldn't take the bet. So it seems that the
<br />
measure only affects your decisions if it enters into your utility
<br />
function somehow, and it's not clear that it must.
<br />
<br />Even if you knew that only universe A is real, that is, A has measure 1,
<br />
and B has measure 0, you could still rationally not take the bet. After
<br />
all, even if universe B doesn't have &quot;real&quot; existence, whatever that
<br />
means, it still has some sort of platonic existence, and you can still
<br />
care more about what happens in universe B than what happens in universe
<br />
A.
<br />
<br />If people's utilities functions could ignore the &quot;real&quot; measure, then what
<br />
relevance does it have? Why are we arguing about whether the real measure
<br />
is the Speed Prior or a more dominant prior?
<br />
<br />You might argue that most people aproximately behave as if they use the
<br />
real measure. But by using the word &quot;most&quot; you're already presuming that
<br />
the real measure is relevant. In the above example (where universe B has
<br />
measure 0), universe B might be filled with people who ignore the real
<br />
measure and only care about universe B, and if you yourself only cared
<br />
about universe B, then you'd act as if you expected most people to ignore
<br />
the real measure.
