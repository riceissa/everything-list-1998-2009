<em class="quotelev1">&gt;--Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<br />I am currently working on forging a set of beliefs re &quot;Free Will&quot; and they 
<br />
currently go something like this:
<br />
<br />1) It seems to me that math and reality (physics?) are joined at the 
<br />
deepest level.
<br />
<br />My basis:
<br />
<br />Godel's venue as I understand it was the spectrum of the response behavior 
<br />
of entities when asked a question meaningful to that entity.
<br />
<br />Godel showed as I understand it that some mathematical entities belonging 
<br />
to the ensemble of formal systems are unable to respond to all such 
<br />
questions with a single resolving reply.
<br />
<br />Does reality have a similar entity?
<br />
<br />Lets start with the &quot;Nothing&quot; in a way similar to some of my other 
<br />
posts.  Define it as the &quot;is-not&quot; of the system that embeds 
<br />
universe(s).  The definition is already a problem because it is like a toe 
<br />
tag attached to the &quot;Nothing&quot; that effectively parses (not necessarily in a 
<br />
time based sense) reality into two  sub systems.  But that is another 
<br />
story.  Now since universe(s) seem to be at the least information and we 
<br />
should avoid preselecting the nature of the information that can describe a 
<br />
universe then the &quot;Nothing&quot; can contain (embed) no information.
<br />
<br />Since the &quot;Nothing&quot; embeds no information it can not respond at all to a 
<br />
meaningful question.  The issue is now one of: Is there a meaningful 
<br />
question to which it must respond?  As I have said before I think the 
<br />
answer is yes.  It is the question of its own persistence.  The &quot;Nothing&quot; 
<br />
can only deal with this by incorporating some response as an axiom 
<br />
(information).  So to me the &quot;Nothing&quot; seems incomplete in the Godelian 
<br />
sense.  Further after this necessary event it is no longer the 
<br />
&quot;Nothing&quot;.  It has &quot;exploded&quot; - as some say - into something else.   It 
<br />
seems unlikely that the follow on entity is any more complete as a result 
<br />
of the &quot;explosion&quot; so - fortunately for us - the &quot;explosion&quot; continues.
<br />
<br />It seems to me that a universe suffers from a similar issue due to the 
<br />
existence of the next up theory re the general absence of a decision 
<br />
procedure.  A universe being unable to respond to some meaningful questions 
<br />
with a single resolving response simply produces the entire ensemble - the MWI.
<br />
<br />Further I think one can make other more real life examples such as a 
<br />
manufacturing system.  Here we have an alphabet - quarks and such,  axioms 
<br />
- particular arrangements of quarks and such called raw material, rules of 
<br />
grammar  - quality control,  rules of inference - process 
<br />
instructions,  and escapes are just examples of the general absence of a 
<br />
decision procedure.
<br />
<br />2) Suppose I convince myself that there is no such thing as free will.
<br />
<br />I have then decided that I can not decide.
<br />
<br />Is that not what Turing did?
<br />
<br />There is no reason that I can think of for reality to depart from the 
<br />
nature of its contents so since it contains Turing's result then the states 
<br />
of reality should be discrete and at most countably infinite to correspond 
<br />
with the presence of the diagonal argument that supports Turing's result.
<br />
<br />Since the entries in the Turing table (the outputs of all computer 
<br />
programs) do not talk to each other (the essence of the diagonal argument 
<br />
is the lack of inter output influence) neither do the states of 'Worlds&quot;.
<br />
<br />The sentence:
<br />
<br />&quot;I have decided I can not decide.&quot;  acts like Epimenides Paradox in the 
<br />
sense that Epimenides Paradox is an example of an undecidable and the basis 
<br />
of Godel's result and &quot;I have decided I can not decide&quot; is Turing's result 
<br />
and Godel's is of course a corollary of that so Epimenides Paradox must be 
<br />
contained within &quot;I have decided I can not decide&quot;.
<br />
<br />The undecidability simply causes reality to jump (at some point) to all 
<br />
possible next states for that world (MWI).  That is a determined result.
<br />
<br />Conclusions so far:
<br />
<br />The description of states of reality are discrete, do not communicate, are 
<br />
at most countably infinite in number, can be infinite in length, have a 
<br />
determined succession, there is no free will.
<br />
<br />However, I see no reason why reality must visit these states in some 
<br />
ordered sequence or in some ordered grouping - only one branch of MWI may 
<br />
be active for some number of transitions for example.
<br />
<br />An illusion of free will may reside in this last.
<br />
<br />Well anyway that is where my thinking stands at the moment.
<br />
<br />Hal Ruhl
