<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replaced by a z-axis, for example?
</em><br />
<br />Well, you could just replace the letter t with the letter z, but of course
<br />
that wouldn't change the underlying nature of things.  You might well
<br />
say that there was still a time axis, just that it had a different name.
<br />
<br />But the bigger question is whether the order in which a universe is
<br />
computed must match the concept of &quot;time&quot; within that universe.  It is
<br />
true that for universes like ours, it seems difficult to compute them
<br />
in any way other than starting at the past and working our way into
<br />
the future.  In that case, the order of computation is the same as the
<br />
within-universe time axis.
<br />
<br />However it might be dangerous to generalize and to assume that this is
<br />
always the case, or that one can go so far as to define the concept of
<br />
time within a universe to be the order in which things were computed.
<br />
<br />It is not difficult to come up with universes that can be computed in
<br />
a different order than the &quot;natural&quot; within-universe direction of time.
<br />
Even our own universe appears to be time-symmetric at the micro-scale.
<br />
The only reason we have an arrow of time is apparently because the
<br />
universe was created in a special low-entropy state.  A universe without
<br />
such a special state at one end could be computed in either direction.
<br />
Or we could start in the middle and compute forward and backward from
<br />
that point.  Or maybe we could even compute it sideways, taking a
<br />
particular timelike line as the &quot;initial conditions&quot;.
<br />
<br />Further, in our own universe there appears to be quite a bit of ambiguity
<br />
about time ordering, and many different computational strategies will
<br />
work equally well.  Relativity theory shows that events either have a
<br />
timelike separation, in which case it is clear which one is in the past,
<br />
or a spacelike separation, which makes it ambiguous which one is farther
<br />
in the past.
<br />
<br />It was suggested here a while back that a Life universe could be
<br />
computed using an algorithm which ran around somewhat randomly and made
<br />
localized changes to cells in order to make them match the Life rules.
<br />
Eventually this would converge to a stable and consistent Life universe.
<br />
Any observers living in that universe would have a perceived direction
<br />
of time that was very different from the actual order in which it was
<br />
computed.
<br />
<br />However although this is possible, I think it is likely that any
<br />
high-measure universe containing observers like us will pretty much
<br />
have to be computed in the past-to-future direction of time.  That seems
<br />
to be the best way to specify a universe like ours with simple initial
<br />
conditions, using a simple algorithm.  So I imagine that in practice,
<br />
for most universes that we are interested in, it will be correct to
<br />
identify subjective (within-universe) time with computational ordering.
<br />
But this is not true in general.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Tegmark in one of his papers considers universes with two or more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;time dimensions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this universe is computable, it can be simulated by an algorithm that can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run in a universe with only one time dimension. Perhaps the algorithm would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; go back and forth between simulating time increments in different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directions, like how a regular computer can simulate a parallel computer.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but there is still a difference between two time dimensions and one,
<br />
just as there is a difference between two spatial dimensions and one.
<br />
An interesting question is whether there would be any algorithms possible
<br />
in a universe with two dimensional time that would run fundamentally
<br />
faster than in a universe with one dimensional time.  I don't understand
<br />
the concept well enough to address that.  But if so, a being who evolved
<br />
in such a universe might deny that one dimensional time observers could
<br />
exist, that such a limited notion of time would be rich enough to support
<br />
the computational complexity necessary for life and intelligence to exist.
