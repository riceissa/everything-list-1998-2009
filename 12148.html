<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So you are saying the special something which causes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness and which functionalism has ignored
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is the electric field around the neuron/astrocyte.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But electric fields were well understood even a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hundred years ago, weren't they? Why couldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a neuron be simulated by something like a SPICE model?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even if there is some new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physics involved, once the equations are worked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out then either with pencil and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper or with the aid of a computer you should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be able to model the neuron: given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; starting parameters, work out what it is going to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do in future. Do you disagree that this would be possible?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis Papaioannou
</em><br />
<br />Yes. I disagree.
<br />
<br />The problem is in the statement:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But electric fields were well understood even a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hundred years ago, weren't they?
</em><br />
<br />NO! they are _not_ understood (explained) they are only described. The
<br />
descriptions do not say what an electric field is. They do not predict an
<br />
electric field. They do not say WHY maxwells equations are what they are.
<br />
There is no real explanation! No true 'understanding'.
<br />
<br />Nothing - I repeat - NOTHING is explained by science at this stage. All
<br />
there is is a whole bunch of mathematical models describing how things
<br />
'appear' (eg quantum mechanics). This is not 'what they are'. Making wave
<br />
its arms about like a model does not create &quot;what they are&quot;. If there are
<br />
properties innate to the 'stuff' involved in a situation X they waving
<br />
stuff around like the model of situation X does not does not implement
<br />
those properties.
<br />
<br />This is a fundamental blockage in thinking. Everybody in physics and maths
<br />
thinks that equations drive things. Bollocks. They merely describe.
<br />
<br />I've just spent a month writing about this very thing. It's making me very
<br />
grumpy and frustrated that something 300 years old and really obvious
<br />
still hasn't sunk in. The universe is NOT made of model/descriptions of
<br />
its appearances!
<br />
<br />It's made of something that, in the right circumstances, delivers
<br />
appearances(to a suitably equipped agent made of it) and it behaves like
<br />
it does within those appearances when you look with the appearance
<br />
generator thus implemented (a brain). Models of the appearance are just
<br />
models of appearances! They are very predictive but are completely devoid
<br />
of all causality. Making a machine run as per the models won't do it.
<br />
<br />It's doesn't mean we can't achieve what we want in an artefact (pain) - it
<br />
just means that functionalist dreaming isn't enough.
<br />
<br />I found this today:
<br />
&quot;The Explicit Animal&quot; Raymond Tallis. He goes through the issues really
<br />
well and trashes functionalism properly.
<br />
<br />My preoccupation with electric fields is that they have correlated
<br />
perfectly with everything I have thrown at them for 5 years and they
<br />
predict everything. The trick is to understand the kind of universe that
<br />
expresses something that looks like electric fields run by Maxwells
<br />
equations - NOT to run models according to maxwell's equations.
<br />
<br />cheers,
<br />
