Greetings, 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In what way dont I have experience of myself? Who am I experiencing now?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Someone else?
</em><br />
<br />You have no guarantee of &quot;whom&quot; you are &quot;experiencing&quot;. it is your
<br />
belief that you are experiencing something that is &quot;yourself&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That I exist is more certain than any scientific truth. This is what I said.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can argue about experiences, illusions and being misled by perception if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you like, the argument that will come back is that the very fact I am being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misled by perception or undergoing an illusion proves beyond doubt to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that I exist.
</em><br />
<br />you have no guarantee whether you exist in any one ELSE's reality.
<br />
That you are sure that you exist in YOUR reality is a useless idea to
<br />
the ME that is seperate from YOU. To ME it is no more than a belief.
<br />
Any statement that is not verifiable is usually not taken as &quot;fact&quot;.
<br />
anything that is not known to be a &quot;fact&quot; is not &quot;completely certain&quot;.
<br />
Descartes tried to describe one such verification in &quot;I think
<br />
therefore I am&quot;, but this is also just a &quot;thought&quot;, so it is more
<br />
accurate to say &quot;I think I think, therefore I think I am&quot; [
<br />
www.cs.iitm.ernet.in/~swamy ]. Descartes was wrong in thinking that
<br />
his statement was the final verification of self-existance.
<br />
<br />I admit that truth and provability are not the same thing, but by the
<br />
same token, &quot;something is not disproven, or not disprovable&quot; is not
<br />
necessarily true.
<br />
<br />Ofcourse you CAN say that your body exists, your brain exists, even
<br />
probably that the software in your brain exists, these even a realist
<br />
would admit, because now you are in the realm of VERIFIABLE
<br />
statements.
<br />
<br />notice that I am not disproving your claim, because you qualify it as
<br />
being true if and only if YOU think you have verified it as true. So
<br />
basically going by your own claim that subjectivity is &quot;more certain&quot;
<br />
than science, I can have my &quot;subjective truth&quot; that you don't exist. I
<br />
can be morbid enough to take &quot;I exist if and only if your self does
<br />
not exist&quot; as my subjective reality. What if I believe &quot;I don't exist&quot;
<br />
(most times I really do believe that), can you disprove it?
<br />
<br />As soon as you say something that is not universally verifiable (note
<br />
that verifiability is different from provability, Godel sentences are
<br />
trivially verified to be true, but unprovable) you are stating a
<br />
belief, something &quot;certain&quot; for you, but maybe not for others. you
<br />
accept it on faith because you cannot prove it to yourself if you
<br />
honestly treat yourself in the third person for a second.
<br />
<br />Faith MAY be true, there's no denying that. but till it is verified as
<br />
such, it should not be classified as that. and science DOES deal with
<br />
this issue, refining its axioms based on verifiable facts that aught
<br />
to be derivable from the axiomatic system. realists don't pack it away
<br />
in &quot;laziness&quot;, they just don't presume to assign truth values to such
<br />
statements until verification.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Given its certainty, it demands some kind of explanation
</em><br />
<br />Verifiability is a prerequisite for certainty. If we don't agree on
<br />
the definition of &quot;verifiability&quot;, then there can be no reconciliation
<br />
between us, because you can never convince ME that you exist, I can
<br />
always think you are a figment of my imagination with no personal
<br />
experiences of your own, and therefore you don't experience anything,
<br />
and your non-existence is subject only to a reconfiguration of my mind
<br />
(your deletion from it). Ofcourse this is my subjective &quot;truth&quot; which
<br />
you yourself are allowing me to have. But my whole point is that
<br />
assuming things that are &quot;unverifiable universally&quot; as true leads to
<br />
these conflicting &quot;truths&quot;.
<br />
<br />This is what a realist begs: &quot;please admit only LOGICALLY verifiable
<br />
things are true or false&quot;. A realist is even humbler: he knows that
<br />
even the logic we use is open to questioning, in other words
<br />
verifiable. true/false applies only to verifiable things. in not
<br />
assigning truth values to such statement a realist is not being lazy,
<br />
only being cautious (or realistic if you may).
<br />
