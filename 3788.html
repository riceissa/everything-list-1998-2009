<em class="quotelev1">&gt; papers on which my &quot;quantum&quot; derivation relies. I mentionned it a lot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some time ago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And now that I speak about Goldblatt, because of Tim May who dares
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to refer to algebra, category and topos! I want mention that Goldblatt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; did wrote an excellent introduction to Toposes: &quot;Topoi&quot;. (One of the big
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem in topos theory is which plural chose for the word &quot;topos&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are two schools: topoi (like Goldblatt), and toposes (like Bar and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wells). :)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Goldblatt book on topoi has been heavily attacked by &quot;pure categorically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minded algebraist like Johnstone for exemple, because there is a remnant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; smell of set theory in topoi. That is true, but that really help for an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduction. So, if you want to be introduced to the topos theory,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Goldblatt Topoi, North Holland editor 19?(I will look at home) is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perhaps the one.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, this is an excellent book. It has more of an expositional style 
<br />
than many books on category and topos theory.  It's out of print and 
<br />
Amazon has been looking for months for a used copy for me. (Amazon can 
<br />
search for books which become available. I also have them searching for 
<br />
a copy of Mac Lane and Moerdijk's book on sheaves, logic, and toposes, 
<br />
also out of print.)
<br />
<br />Fortunately, I live near UC Santa Cruz, which has an excellent science 
<br />
library.
<br />
<br />The category and topos theory books I actually _own_ (bought through 
<br />
Amazon) are:
<br />
<br />* Cameron, Peter, &quot;Sets, Logic and Categories, 1998. An undergraduate 
<br />
level primer on these topics. One chapter on categories. (By the way, 
<br />
most modern algebra books, e.g., Lang's &quot;Algebra,&quot; Fraleigh, Dummitt and 
<br />
Foote, etc. have introductory chapters on category theory, as this is 
<br />
the &quot;language&quot; of modern abstract algebra.)
<br />
<br />* Lawvere, F. William, Schanuel, Stephen H., &quot;Conceptual Mathematics: A 
<br />
first introduction to categories,&quot; 1997. This is a fantastic 
<br />
introduction to categorical thinking. The authors are pioneers in topos 
<br />
theory, but the presentation is suitable for any bright person. There is 
<br />
not much on applications, and certainly no mention of quantum mechanics 
<br />
a la Isham, Markopoulou, etc. But the conceptual ideas are profound. 
<br />
(And this should be read before tackling the &quot;formalistic&quot; presentations 
<br />
in other books.)
<br />
<br />* Pierce, Benjamin, &quot;Basic Category Theory for Computer Scientists,&quot; 
<br />
1991. A thin (80 pages) book which outlines the basics. Includes 
<br />
material on compilers, the &quot;Effective&quot; topos of Hyland and others, 
<br />
cartesian closed categories, etc.
<br />
<br />* Mac Lane, Saunders, &quot;Categories for the Working Mathematician, Second 
<br />
Edition,&quot; 1971, 1998. Wow. A dense book by the co-founder of category 
<br />
theory. As someone said, reading along at 10% comprehension is better 
<br />
than reading other books at full comprehension. I find the book sort of 
<br />
dry, on historical and conceptual motivations, but Mac Lane has written 
<br />
many longer expositions in MAA collections of reminiscences...I just 
<br />
wish mathematicians would do more of what John Baez in his papers: show 
<br />
the reader the motivations.
<br />
<br />(Much of mathematical writing came out of the tradition of &quot;lecture 
<br />
notes.&quot; In fact, the leading publisher of mathematics, Springer-Verlag, 
<br />
calls their series &quot;Lecture Notes,&quot; or, more recently, &quot;Graduate Texts.&quot; 
<br />
Brilliant mathematicians like Emil Artin and Emmy Noether would have 
<br />
their lectures on algebra transcribed by grad students or post-docs, 
<br />
like Van der Waerden, who would then republish the notes as &quot;Moderne 
<br />
Algebra,&quot; the first of the &quot;groups-rings-fields&quot; modern algebra books. 
<br />
Which is why one of E. Artin's students, Lang, writes so many dry books! 
<br />
These books are often very short on pictures or diagrams, very short on 
<br />
segues and motivations. It's as if all of what a good teacher would do 
<br />
in class, with drawings on blackboards, with historical asides, with 
<br />
mentions of how material ties in with material already covered, with 
<br />
mention of open research problems and unexplored territory...it's as if 
<br />
all this material is just left out of these texts. Too bad.)
<br />
<br />* Lambek, J., Scott, P.J., &quot;Introduction to higher order categorical 
<br />
logic,&quot; 1986. Way too advanced for me at this point. So no comments on 
<br />
content. But it's useful to glance at topics so as to get some idea of 
<br />
where things are going (part of the issue of motivation I raised above).
<br />
<br />* Taylor, Paul, &quot;Practical Foundations of Mathematics,&quot; 1999. Another 
<br />
advanced book, covering logic, recursive function theory, cartesian 
<br />
closed categories, and a lot of the second half I can't comment on. A 
<br />
wonderful browsing book, as he has lots of tidbits and asides.
<br />
<br />There are 3-4 other books I'd like to get, including the Goldblatt book 
<br />
(he is giving permission to Xerox his book, so I may do that), the Mac 
<br />
Lane and Moerdijk book, and a few others. Peter Johnstone wrote the 
<br />
defining book on toposes in 1977...long-since out of print and 
<br />
long-since overtaken by newer results. Ah, but he is about to have his 
<br />
massive 3-volume set of books on topos theory published:
<br />
<br />Here's John Baez's summary in his Week 180 column:
<br />
<br />&quot;2) Peter Johnstone, Sketches of an Elephant: a Topos Theory Compendium, 
<br />
Cambridge U. Press. Volume 1, comprising Part A: Toposes as Categories, 
<br />
and Part B: 2-categorical Aspects of Topos Theory, 720 pages, to appear 
<br />
in June 2002. Volume 2, comprising Part C: Toposes as Spaces, and Part 
<br />
D: Toposes as Theories, 880 pages, to appear in June 2002. Volume 3, 
<br />
comprising Part E: Homotopy and Cohomology, and Part F: Toposes as 
<br />
Mathematical Universes, in preparation.
<br />
<br />&quot;I can't wait to dig into this. A topos is a kind of generalization of 
<br />
the universe of set theory that we all know and love, but topos theory 
<br />
is really a wonderful way to unify and generalize vast swathes of 
<br />
mathematics - you could say it's the way that logic and topology merge 
<br />
when you take category theory seriously. I've really just begun to get a 
<br />
glimmering of what it's all about, so I'm curious to see Johnstone's 
<br />
overall view of the subject. &quot;
<br />
<br />(end of John Baez's comments)
<br />
<br />The first two volumes are due this month or next, according to Oxford 
<br />
University Press (_not_ Cambridge!) and Amazon. Cost for the two is a 
<br />
whopping $295. But the books are 750 and 850 pages, respectively.
<br />
<br />I'm am steeling myself to buying them. A lot of money, but this stuff is 
<br />
more entertaining to me than spending the same amount for 1-2 nights in 
<br />
a hotel, or lots of other things people spend their money on. And 
<br />
obviously 1500 pages is a lot of reading!
<br />
<br />And to better understand these things, I've been brushing up on my math 
<br />
background. A lot of algebra texts (mentioned above), topology (Munkres, 
<br />
Hocking and Young, Alexandroff, various Dover editions), and algebraic 
<br />
topology (Massey, Bredon, Fulton, etc.). My background is mostly 
<br />
physics, but I fortunately had some good exposure to analysis and 
<br />
measure theory, the stuff that can provide the assumed &quot;mathematical 
<br />
maturity&quot; for further study. I wish I'd spent more time studying this 
<br />
stuff...but wishing about changes in the past is pointless.
<br />
<br />I'm here now, in my one and only present, and this category and topos 
<br />
theory is turning out to be enjoyable and stimulating as a goal unto 
<br />
itself, and as a tool for, I think, better understanding things I want 
<br />
to understand.
