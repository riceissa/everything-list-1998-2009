<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;Samuel Johnson did refute Berkeley.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main thrust of Berkley's argument is to show that sensory perception is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indirect, and therefore the existence of a material cause for those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceptions is an unjustified inference in contravention of Occam's razor. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The argument that the look, texture, smell, taste and sound of an object are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apprehended indirectly is successful in my opinion, and I don't feel any need 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to defend it unless someone really thinks a defence is required.
</em><br />
<br />Do *you* contend that the existence of material causes for your
<br />
perceptions is unjustified?  Good grief.
<br />
<br />As for your other statement, these senses are indeed, just as you
<br />
say, apprehended indirectly. (That's the difference between realists
<br />
and naive realists, e.g., children.) Of course there is no need for
<br />
you to defend that, because no one here would disagree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Afterall, on any view there is a translation of 'signals' of many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different forms (light waves, sound waves) , into various 'signals'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the same form (neurons firing) which become synaesthetically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unified into a whole, such that we associate the smell, taste,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; colour and texture of say an orange, as being qualities of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same object.
</em><br />
<br />Of course. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...Berkley's move here is to insist that it we have enough
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information now to create the appearance of a 3 dimensional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world out of elements that are not intrinsically extended.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure what you mean. By elements already in the brain?
<br />
Yes, that's true. But they got into the brain by the aforementioned
<br />
processes, as you know. Don't lose sight of the fact that almost
<br />
all the information came from outside.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; By Occam then, we should not infer something for which there is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requirement - however firmly that inference has been imbedded in us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We should stick to using what we can know directly. Perception.
</em><br />
<br />You don't know all this complicated crap (neurons, perception, 
<br />
inference, the whole nine yards) nearly as well as you know
<br />
the monitor in front of you.  The problem is the word &quot;know&quot;.
<br />
<br />The first things you knew consciously, and knew well, were things
<br />
outside your skin: your mother and father, and tables and chairs.
<br />
Let's resist the temptation to begin using words in other ways.
<br />
<br />Much, much later you ceased being a naive realist and became a
<br />
realist. You understood that there can be things like optical
<br />
illusions, and altered states of consciousness. You even understood
<br />
that your own exalted consciousness is not anything to be utterly
<br />
depended upon, because one can be sick or crazy. (If it hasn't 
<br />
happened to you yet, then just stay around a few more decades.)
<br />
<br />Build carefully upon what is simple and knowable, and keep the
<br />
wild theories to a minimum.  Even then, the world is hardly
<br />
simple, but at least we've got a chance. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In other words, dualists and materialists contravene Occam, not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idealists. I don't see how Johnson refuted that.
</em><br />
<br />Materialists do not contravene Occam. The simplest explanation is
<br />
that there is a world &quot;out there&quot; and that our brains are survival
<br />
machines designed by evolution to thrive in it. The phantasms that
<br />
occasionally infest our awareness and consciousness causally arise
<br />
as side-effects of how our brains work, that's all.
<br />
<br />The simplest explanation does *not* start with perceptions and
<br />
all the rest of that stuff, for a number of reasons. The primary
<br />
reason is that you can't truly communicate them to others---after
<br />
all, your brain may not work the same as theirs. As Wittgenstein
<br />
said, &quot;Of what we cannot speak thereof we must be silent&quot;.
<br />
