I really enjoyed this post!  It's amusing that you are vying
<br />
for the title of &quot;worst in the group!&quot;

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Chris Maloney - the latest, and worst, addition to our little

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; group.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have posted maybe five times. I mainly explain my own personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories. Unlike Chris, I haven't read any of the archived posts.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; None of my posts have fit in with the regular discussions. Remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my idea that all worlds branch or converge toward one future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously crackpot. How 'bout when I dropped time as a dimension. No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one has posted a response to anything I have written.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have been ignored. I posted ideas about the distant future being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determined or inevitable, and how that shapes the present, which got
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no direct response.
</em><br />
<br />I read your last post with interest, but then, I'll admit, it did
<br />
start to seem a little bit too &quot;out there&quot;, so I didn't respond.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Quantumly speaking, we know the past is not determined until we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observe it, as is true of the future. There isn't merely one past. So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can imagine the wave function of all possible worlds in the past.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The wave function is very wide first considering the immediate past,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yet as we look ever deeper into the past, all the many possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; worlds we can envision merge toward a single beginning, common to all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paths, the Big Bang.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure you can regard the Big Bang as one, single beginning.
<br />
Isn't it possible that there was as much variability in it as there
<br />
is in the present day universe?  The entropy was much lower, but that
<br />
has been increasing steadily, so that couldn't be used to justify
<br />
your statement that in the recent past, the number of branches was
<br />
large, whereas in the distant past it was smaller.
<br />
<br />Or could it?  Actually, this may be correct.  I'm not very clear on
<br />
the relationship between entropy and information.  Could anyone
<br />
recommend a book on this topic?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; All possible worlds begin from or near a common
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single state. Notice how that one inevitable distant past shapes what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we observe about the past. It shapes our present. It makes the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; background radiation evenly distributed. It shows us one model of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; past, not many depending upon which direction we look, or on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different days.
</em><br />
<br />I think the term you're looking for here is &quot;boundary condition&quot;.
<br />
And I agree with you that it is perfectly valid to look it that
<br />
way - that the boundary condition &quot;shapes&quot; the evolution that we
<br />
discern.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The common origin of all quantum worlds makes our past consistent and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contributes to the flow of time being consistent. It radically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; narrows the wave function, as related to what is possible to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happened. Now look at the future. What is possible in the immediate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future is also wide. Consider that the set of all possible futures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; narrows toward a single outcome, a single state, just like the past.
</em><br />
<br />What might that be?  The Omega Point?  But evidence is mounting
<br />
that the universe is open, and that the expansion is accelerating.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Notice how that single future would shape our world, our present,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just as the single state in our past shapes our world.
</em><br />
<br />I'm with you here, and again I agree.  If you start with an
<br />
assumption of some future boundary condition, then it is perfectly
<br />
valid to say that it &quot;shapes&quot; our present and our immediate
<br />
future.  For example (I believe there were discussions on this
<br />
early in this lists history) if you start with an assumption of
<br />
QTI, and then set up the following experiment with flipping a coin
<br />
a number of times:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll 1:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- if I see tails then I'll be allowed to live
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- if I see heads then I'll be required to flip again
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll 2:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- if it comes up tails I'll be allowed to live
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- if it comes up heads I'll be instantly killed
<br />
Then I would expect the probability that I'll see heads the first
<br />
flip would be 2/3, not 1/2.
<br />
<br />This is the same as in my story, where I expected that the odds
<br />
of something going wrong during the preparatory steps to setting
<br />
up the device would increase the closer I got.
<br />
<br />But it doesn't have to be QTI (FAP).  It's certainly true for any
<br />
future boundary condition that it would &quot;shape&quot; our present
<br />
experiences.  The trouble is in determining what that future
<br />
boundary condition would be.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Notice finally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that if the past only shaped the present, if the future didn't shape
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the present, then what is possible; the wave function, would expand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; radically into chaotic possibilities. Then, there would be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rational laws of nature.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I agree with that.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So anyway, I don't see why Chris gets to be denoted as the worst
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; member of this group. This is not fair. I mean, he shared something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; personal but the topic clearly related to quantum immortality,
</em><br />
<br />That's what I was thinking when I wrote it.  And, to tell you the
<br />
truth, I've been dying (sorry for the pun) to tell someone about
<br />
it for years now.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; come on, it was great reading. Damn, I thought it was an excerpt from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a book or something. It reminded me of Douglas Adams. Seriously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chris, I thought it was too polished to be a post. You should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consider publishing that story, and I am not just saying that to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; redeem my position.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the issue of quantum suicide, there are factors to what is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible in the branching paths of time that are not being discussed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in this group and that are simply not known at this time. A line from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; LeGuin, &quot;The truth is that as a man's real power grows and his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge widens, ever the way he can follow grows narrower; until at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last he chooses nothing, but does only and wholly what he must do...&quot;
</em><br />
<br />I hope that's not true.  It also reminds me of Niven's Pak creatures,
<br />
who were so smart that they always knew exactly what the best course
<br />
of action was.  But I tend to think that as we get smarter, the
<br />
problems get more difficult, and decisiveness remains elusive.
<br />
There's a line from C.S. Lewis' &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life is not like a pool but like a tree. It does not move toward
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unity but away from it and the creatures grow further apart as they
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;increase in perfection. Good, as it ripens, becomes continually
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more different not only from evil but from other good.
<br />
<br />You can substitute &quot;wisdom&quot; for &quot;good&quot;, I think.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again, the future is shaping the past, so it doesn't matter much what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course one maneuvers. We cannot escape the future. Eventually we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collide with the same problems, in this life or whatever follows, so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we face and eventually solve them. Its part of the process. We each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are an evolving universe. That's not meant to be positive. Its real.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I didn't think your story was scary at all. It was real and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fascinating, sort of in the sense that fact is more fascinating than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fiction. You see I think already in different terms. If this group is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; centered upon discussing an everything universe, and is going to do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything other than regurgitate other peoples science and idea, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needs to confront more vividly the issues surrounding timelessness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the meaning of an infinite universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most people respond with fear and avoidance to the suicide option,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mainly from our common struggle to cope with the meaninglessness that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creeps into our lives. How does our response change if we factually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know that the observer exists beyond death?
</em><br />
<br />Beg your pardon?  I certainly don't think the observer exists
<br />
beyond death.  I would substitute something else for the preposition
<br />
&quot;beyond&quot;, maybe &quot;beside&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If this group was really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accomplishing something, it would be a place to exercise the mind in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different ways of seeing such things as real death, or suicide, from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the perspectives that result of MWs, or an anthropic universe, an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer created reality, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here is something I like to think about. There is no place where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe is not. If the observer is indeed a world in itself, then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cannot stop existing. Its not a choice we have. Non-existence cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be. What we are, what we become, is ever changing, yet each observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience ends as another begins. That is true of every moment. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; die in the stillness of each moment and are constantly reborn into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; another.
</em><br />
<br />Well put!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now that is deep shit without direct mention of any science. And I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have spent hours writing my other posts, carefully explaining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; crackpot theories that contradict much of what you guys discuss. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't see why Chris should get all the violent opposition.
</em><br />
<br />Yeah!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If that doesn't work, let me share other thoughts. I think there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be a different title for those such as Einstein, Newton,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Feynman and Hawking, the explorers and creators of science, and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; masses that follow claiming also to be scientists, who in fact don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relate at all. That's really not so much of an insult to anyone as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one might think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mainly, I think most in this group need to keep in mind a healthy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dose of reasonable doubt that we have all the major factors needed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand the shape of many worlds or of an ensemble or everything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory. This shouldn't be a discussion place of sharply narrow issues
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yet. Ideally this group needs a monitor that would keep discussions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; civilized, open, and vibrant, to counteract individuals who desire to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; squelch all but their own adherence and discipline.
</em><br />
<br />Well, I still feel bad that I used profanity in my post to Jacques.
<br />
I should have sent it to him outside the group.
