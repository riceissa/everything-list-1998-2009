Norman,
<br />
&quot;wonder if  your opinion will be that no opinion is possible?&quot;
<br />
not on this list! Sufficiently sophisticated minds can formulate opinions to
<br />
ANY question (situation problem).
<br />
First: the &quot;WHY&quot;
<br />
I enjoyed the URL, with its contemporary Q-science based views.
<br />
Of course in English there is no difference between 'why' as for what
<br />
purpose and 'why' by what reason. Other languages are more specific.
<br />
<br />Then the 'constants', the eucharist of physicists. They are scale-related
<br />
results of a model view observed by instruments constructed for such use and
<br />
calculated as 'equational' with other models (limited cuts of potential
<br />
impredicativities). The huge model has been brought into an admirable
<br />
balance and its nth level (backwards) fundaments are sacrosanct. Constants,
<br />
axioms, givens, rates, equations etc. are all in
<br />
untouchable quantized unification with artifacts like energy, mass, photon,
<br />
quark, whatever. Who would dare to question the cloths of the emperor?
<br />
<br />Yes, the 'traditional cosmolgy' narrative is on shaky grounds. I made up
<br />
another narrative, in which THIS universe (and innumerable other different
<br />
ones) start on a humanly followable reasonable basis, putting the
<br />
non-information based origination (instead of a creation or a Q-fluctuation)
<br />
one step further back, in my unidentified (mostly!) Plenitude in which the
<br />
'invariant dynamic symmetrical everything' must produce also assymetrical
<br />
nods within the total invariance.
<br />
These are considered universes and dissipate as they formed. Not by the
<br />
inside vue and not for us, where we 'see' our space-time physical system as
<br />
small and huge, shorttime and longterm.
<br />
The rest depends on the elements of the universe-originating nod, the
<br />
composition of the assymmetry, potentially unlimitedly different for every
<br />
universe. Nice narrative, no math.
<br />
<br />Such universes are (again: from the insider vue) endogenously active in
<br />
their motions during that timelessness(!) until they re-evaporate into the
<br />
Plenitude.  No 'why' for cause, no 'why' for purpose.
<br />
<br />Your par:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, it's Pearce's viewpoint about  &quot;WHY DOES ANYTHING &gt;EXIST&quot; that
</em><br />
I'm interested in.  This viewpoint is expressed at
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://www.hedweb.com/nihilism/nihilfil.htm">http://www.hedweb.com/nihilism/nihilfil.htm</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;His conclusion seems to be that everything in the multiverse adds up &gt;to
</em><br />
zero, so there are no loose ends  that need explaining.  Even if &gt;true, this
<br />
doesn't answer the WHY question,  however.&lt;
<br />
<br />seems congruent with my idea in more than one sense.
<br />
No question: no answer. Opinion we may have.
<br />

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stathis,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for your identification of David Pearce - I see he was co-founder

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; respect for Bostrom's views.
