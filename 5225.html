</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;The view that Mathematical Existence == Physical Existence implies that

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&quot;physical resources&quot; is a secondary concept, and that the ultimate ground
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of any physical universe is Mathspace, which doesn't require resources of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;any kind. Clearly, you don't think the idea that ME == PE makes sense.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;That's understandable, but here's a brief sketch of why I think it makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;more sense than the alternative view (which I'll call
</em><br />
&quot;Instantiationism&quot;):
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the mere postulation of existence is insufficient: it does not
<br />
thing to inform us of how it is that it is even possible for us, as mere
<br />
finite humans, to have experiences that &quot;change&quot;. We have to address why it
<br />
is that Time, even if it is ultimately an &quot;illusion&quot;, and the distingtion
<br />
between past and future is so intimately intetwined in our world of
<br />
experience. How is it that we can think that it is reasonable to expect the
<br />
physically impossible to become possible by just postulating that it be so?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There ain't no such thing as a free lunch!&quot; - Robert Heinleim
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Here's my definition of &quot;Computational Realism&quot;, which is sort of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;restricted version of Mathematical Realism. (I'm not sure if my
</em><br />
definition
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is equivalent to what others call &quot;Arithmetic Realism&quot;, so I'm using a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;different term.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. Just to cut the hair a little bit: with Church thesis &quot;computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; realism&quot; is equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a restricted form of arithmetical realism. Comp. realism is equivalent to
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arith. realism restricted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the Sigma_1 sentences, i.e. those sentence which are provably
</em><br />
equivalent
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (in Peano arithmetic, say) to sentences of the form &quot;it exists x such that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; p(x)&quot; with p(x) a decidable (recursive) predicate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is equivalent to say that either a machine (on any argument) will
</em><br />
stop
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or will not stop, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independently of any actual running.  Indeed, sometimes I say that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Sigma_1) arithmetical realism
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is equivalent to the belief in the excluded middle principe (that is &quot;A or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not A) applied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Sigma_1) arithmetical sentences. (Sigma_1 sentences plays a prominant
</em><br />
role
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the derivation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the logic of the physical propositions from the logic of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-referential propositions). Actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Universal Dovetailing is arithmetically equivalent with an enumeration
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of all true Sigma_1 sentences. The key feature of those sentences is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their truth entails their provability (unlike
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arbitrary sentences which can be true and not provable (by Peano
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetic, for exemple).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno, I do not understand why you use so weak a support for your very
<br />
clever theory! If we are to take the collection of a &quot;true Sigma_1
<br />
sentenses&quot; to have &quot;independent of implementation&quot; existence, why not all of
<br />
the endless hierarchy of Cantor's Cardinals? I have never understood this
<br />
Kroneckerian attitute.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2"> &gt; &gt; [KH]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Let's say that you're about to physically implement some computation, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;lets say that there are only three possible things that this computation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;can do: return 0, return 1, or never halt. Computational Realism is
</em><br />
simply
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the belief that *there is a fact of the matter* about what this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computation will do when you implement it, and that this fact is true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;*right now*, before you even begin the implementation. Furthermore, CR is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the belief that there is fact of the matter about what the result of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computation *would be*, even if it's never actually implemented. CR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;implies that there is such a fact of the matter about every conceivable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computation.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems to me to be equivalent to postulating the existence of a List
<br />
of all possible algorithms and claiming that the postulation is sufficient
<br />
to prove that the output of an arbitrary computation *exists*. This reminds
<br />
me of the joke about Money growing on trees: We would still have to pay
<br />
people to do the &quot;picking&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is that while it ok to assume that &quot;what the result of the
<br />
computation *would be*, even if it's never actually implemented&quot; this is not
<br />
the same as eliminating the mere possibility of the implementation. This is
<br />
just the usual &quot;contrafactual&quot; - what &quot;could of happended but did not&quot; - and
<br />
illustrates some problems that can occur when such are considerred.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [KH]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It's from this perspective that I can begin to explain why I feel that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;implementation is not a fundamental concept. In my view, implementing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computation is a way of &quot;viewing&quot; a structure that already exists in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Mathspace (or Platonia, or whatever you want to call it). Implementation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is clearly something that occurs within computational structures - for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;instance, we can imagine creatures in a cellular automata implementing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computations on their computers, and they will have all the same concerns
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;about &quot;physical resources&quot; that we do - computational complexity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;NP-complete problems, etc. However, the entire infinite structure of
</em><br />
their
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;CA world exists *right now*, in Mathspace. If we consider the rules to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;their CA, and consider an initial state (even an infinite one - say, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;digits of pi), then there is *a fact of the matter* about what the state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of the infinite lattice would be in ten ticks of the clock - or ten
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;thousand, or ten million. And the key point is that the existence of
</em><br />
these
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;facts doesn't require &quot;resources&quot; - there's really no concept of
</em><br />
resources
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;at all at that level. Every single fact about every single possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computation is simply a fact, right now. Every conceivable NP-complete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;problem has an answer, and it doesn't require any &quot;computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;resources&quot; for these answers to exist. But of course, computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;creatures like us require computational resources to &quot;view&quot; these
</em><br />
answers.
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Since our resources are severely limited, we don't have access to most of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the truths in Mathspace.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope, that dog don't hunt! You are confussing the postential existence
<br />
of a computation with its &quot;meaningfulness&quot;. But in the last time you are
<br />
getting close to my thesis. We should not take the a priori existence of,
<br />
for example, answers to NP-Complete problems to have more &quot;ontological
<br />
weight&quot; than those that enter into what it takes for &quot;creatures like us&quot; to
<br />
&quot;view&quot; the answers. This is more the realm of theology than mathematics. ;-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; [KH]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I don't think that this form of realism automatically leads to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;conclusion that ME == PE, but it certainly points in that direction. ME
</em><br />
==
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;PE becomes especially appealing when we consider the infinite regress
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;problem that the alternative position generates. You ask if your question
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is equivalent to the old &quot;first cause&quot; question. I propose that it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;exactly equivalent, and brings with it all of the attendant paradoxes and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;problems. If you believe that implementation is a fundamental concept -
</em><br />
if
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you believe that, somehow, our universe must be &quot;instantiated&quot;, or must
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;have some other special quality that gives it its true reality - then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;you've got an infinite regress problem. Certainly, I can imagine that our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;universe is instantiated in some larger computation, but then that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computation will have to be instantiated in something else to make *it*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;real... and where does it all end? Or is it turtles all the way down? Or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;does our universe simply have the elusive quality of &quot;physical
</em><br />
existence&quot;,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;while other mathematical structures lack it? In my opinion, the idea that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;ME == PE points to a solution to these problems.
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I am not trying to argue that implementation is fundamental to the
<br />
exclusion of the existence of the mathematical structures. I am arguing that
<br />
the two have equal ontological status; one is just as *fundamental* as the
<br />
other. BTW, with the *discovery* of Non-Well founded set theory we have no
<br />
reason to fear Infinite regress when considering abstract structures. ;-)
<br />
<br />[BM]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, although I would say that &quot;physical existence&quot; is only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular case of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence, even a modal sort of existence. But that is another point, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actually I find your answer to Stephen quite clear and sufficient. Isn't
</em><br />
it
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stephen?
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear, yes. Sufficient, no.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; About the question of applying &quot;probability&quot; to integers: there are more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than one way to work
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that problem, and technically this could lead us far away, and I have not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the time to really say more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well I can give you a classical exercise in Number Theory: what is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two integers are coprime (= their biggest common divisor is 1). Answer:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6/pi^2. Astonishing and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counter-intuitive. The meaning is that if you build an urn with N balls on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which you put the N first integers, then, as N is bigger and bigger, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;usual&quot; probability of taking two coprime &quot;balls&quot; will converge toward
</em><br />
6/pi^2.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the probability that k integers are coprime? Answer 1/zeta(k);
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where zeta is the famous Riemann Zeta function. The notion of Probability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; applied on infinite discrete sets or combinatorial structures often
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; invokes Zeta or related functions. Generalisation of zeta function
</em><br />
(notably
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the multi-zeta functions) appears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also in the renormalisation problem in quantum field theory, and I guess
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they will find application in the last definitive steps of our white
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbits elimination ..., i.e. in our search for the measure on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computational histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appearence of zeta in the renormalization problem should not come as
<br />
a surprise! It is implicit in the mathematical tools that renormalization
<br />
uses. This is like the &quot;White Rabbit&quot; that the illusionist pulls out of his
<br />
tophat, to the pleasure and wonder of his audience, but such wonder rests on
<br />
the cleverness of the illusionist in hiding the Rabbit before the show.
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen
