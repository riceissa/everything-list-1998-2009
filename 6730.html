</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reasons (it is not, evolutionarily speaking, a good idea to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; confused by hunters wearing camouflage!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In that case, how am I conflating the two issues? If I'm barking up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the wrong tree, I'd like to know.
</em><br />
<br />It's the second point where I think you conflate two problems.
<br />
<br />My distinction is a little different from Lewis' anyway. From my pov, it's 
<br />
a matter of degree, but one which makes a qualitative difference:
<br />
<br />* Failure of induction: the past fails to predict the future. This occurs 
<br />
in universes a la Hume where physical laws only appear to have been 
<br />
followed by some massive fluke. Also in universes which always had no, or 
<br />
very little, regularity. I claim that as soon as regularity breaks down to 
<br />
this extent, SAS cease to exist, so no matter how common these cases are, 
<br />
we never observe them. No problem. (Lewis' defence is different).
<br />
<br />* White Rabbit: cognizable universes require a high degree of regularity 
<br />
for the survival of SAS (not to mention evolution), as above. Hence 
<br />
induction in any cognizable universe will work most of the time (which is 
<br />
all it does anyway), for a sufficient set of properties of the world. The 
<br />
key point is that this is not *every* property, and not all of the time. 
<br />
Hence there should be universes in which SAS can survive pretty well, but 
<br />
contain a wide variety of phenomena which cannot be unified into a simple 
<br />
theory.  An extreme case is the &quot;rubbish&quot; universe proposed against Lewis, 
<br />
in which the extra phenomena are completely undetectable. Lewis takes this 
<br />
as a serious objection and counters by arguing that it is not possible to 
<br />
say that such universes are &quot;more likely&quot;.  As scientists, I guess we 
<br />
would only take seriously detectable rubbish. NB: whatever the measure you 
<br />
use, unless extremely artificial, the rubbish almost certainly would have 
<br />
much higher entropy than talking White Rabbits. Think of reality has 
<br />
having &quot;snow&quot;, like a badly-tuned TV.
<br />
<br />Of course on objective state-reduction models of QM, our universe does 
<br />
have &quot;snow&quot; in the form of random quantum jumps. But this is a very 
<br />
regular form of snow, which does &quot;unify&quot; into the basic physical laws. The 
<br />
argument is that for some plausible measures (not yours, obviously), even
<br />
macro-scale snow is much more likely than not.
