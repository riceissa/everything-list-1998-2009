<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why is it assumed that a multiple &quot;runs&quot; makes any difference to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure?  
</em><br />
<br />One reason I like this assumption is that it provides a natural reason
<br />
for simpler universes to have greater measure than more complex ones.
<br />
<br />Imagine a Turing machine with an infinite program tape.  But suppose the
<br />
actual program we are running is finite size, say 100 bits.  The program
<br />
head will move back and forth over the tape but never go beyond the
<br />
first 100 bits.
<br />
<br />Now consider all possible program tapes being run at the same time,
<br />
perhaps on an infinite ensemble of (virtual? abstract?) machines.
<br />
Of those, a fraction of 1 in 2^100 of those tapes will start with that
<br />
100 bit sequence for the program in question.  And since the TM never
<br />
goes beyond those 100 bits, all such tapes will run the same program.
<br />
Therefore, 1/2^100 of all the executions of all possible program tapes
<br />
will be of that program.
<br />
<br />Now consider another program that is larger, 120 bits.  By the same
<br />
reasoning, 1 in 2^120 of all possible program tapes will start with that
<br />
particular 120-bit sequence.  And so 1/2^120 of all the executions will
<br />
be of that program.
<br />
<br />Therefore runs of the first program will be 2^20 times more numerous
<br />
than runs of the second.
<br />
<br />If we use the assumption that each of these multiple executions or runs
<br />
contributes to the measure, we therefore can conclude that the measure
<br />
of the universe generated by the first program is 2^20 times greater
<br />
than the measure of the universe generated by the second.  And more
<br />
generally, the measure of a universe is inversely related to the size
<br />
of the program which creates it. Therefore, QED, universes with simple
<br />
programs have a higher measure than universes with more complex programs.
<br />
<br />This conclusion then allows us to further conclude that observers are
<br />
likely to evolve in lawful universes, that is, universes without &quot;flying
<br />
rabbits&quot;, i.e. rare, magical exceptions to otherwise universal laws.
<br />
And we can conclude that the physical laws are likely to be stable or
<br />
at least predictable over time.
<br />
<br />All of these are very properties of the universe which are otherwise
<br />
difficult or impossible to explain.  The fact that the multiverse
<br />
hypothesis can provide some grounds for explaining them is one of the
<br />
main sources of its attractiveness, at least for me.
<br />
<br />However, all this is predicated on the assumption that multiple runs of
<br />
the same program all contribute to the measure.  If that is not true,
<br />
then it would be harder to explain why simple programs are of higher
<br />
measure than more complex ones.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If the computation is reversible we could run the simulation backwards -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even though the initial state make seem contrived because it leads to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; low entropy at the end of the computation.  Given that the simulated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beings don't know the difference (their subjective time runs in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direction of increasing entropy) the fact that the simulation is done in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reverse is irrelevant to them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would a simulation done in reverse contribute to the measure?
</em><br />
<br />When I think of the abstract notion of a universal TM that runs all
<br />
possible programs at once, I don't necessarily picture an explict time
<br />
element being present.  I think of it more as a mapping:
<br />
TM + program ==&gt; universe.  The more programs which create a given
<br />
universe, the higher the measure of that universe.
<br />
<br />However, I don't think I can escape from your question so easily.
<br />
We could alternately imagine an actual, physical computer, sitting in
<br />
our universe somewhere, simulating another universe.  And that should
<br />
contribute to that other universe's measure.  In that case we should
<br />
have some rule that would answer questions about how much reversible
<br />
and reversed simulations contribute.
<br />
<br />I would consider applying Wei Dai's heuristic, which I discussed the
<br />
other day.  It says that the measure of an object is larger if the
<br />
object is easier to find in the universe that holds it.  I gave some
<br />
rough justifications for this, such as the fact that a simple counting
<br />
program eventually outputs every million bit number, but no one would
<br />
say that this means that the complexity of a given million bit number
<br />
is as small as the size of that program.
<br />
<br />In this context, the heuristic would say that the contribution of
<br />
a physical computer simulating another universe to the measure of
<br />
that simulated universe should be based on how easy it is to find the
<br />
computation occuring in our own universe.  Computations which occur
<br />
multiple times would be easier to find, so by Wei's heuristic would
<br />
have higher measure.  This is another path to justify the assumption
<br />
that multiple simulations should contribute more to measure.
<br />
<br />I'd say that a computation running backwards contributes as well,
<br />
by making it easier to locate.  Now take a complex case, where a
<br />
computation ran forwards for a while, then backwards, then forwards.
<br />
I'd say that this heuristic suggests that the portion of the simulated
<br />
universe which was repeated 3 times (forwards, backwards, forwards)
<br />
would have higher measure than the rest of it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Once we say that all possible computations exist in the Platonic sense,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seems to me that running them is irrelevant.  Of course it is agreed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the existence hypothesis tells us nothing about their relative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure.  Does anyone have some principles to go by?
</em><br />
<br />See above.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I presume a theory of measure along the lines described by Jesse would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need to account for the measure of mappings between computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Presumably a simple correspondence would have higher weighting than some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complicated mapping between two computations.  
</em><br />
<br />Yes, this gets into the difficult issue of telling whether two
<br />
computations are running the same program, i.e. whether a mapping exists
<br />
between the two.  I'm hoping to write more about this soon.
<br />
