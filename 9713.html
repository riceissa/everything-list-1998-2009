Hi Norman,
<br />
<br />Le 20-juin-06, à 04:04, Norman Samish a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've endured this thread long enough!  Let's get back to something I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can understand!
</em><br />
<br />This means that at some point  you have stop to understand. It is 
<br />
easier to help if you say so at the moment when you stop to understand. 
<br />
I mean this both for the Universal Dovetailer Argument (UDA) and the 
<br />
&quot;mathematical UDA&quot; (diagonalization stuff). Although UDA does not 
<br />
belongs to math, it is a rigorous reasoning showing that IF someone 
<br />
assume the COMP hypothesis, THEN the physical world appearances MUST 
<br />
emerge from the platonic relations that occur among numbers. Then the 
<br />
mathematical UDA, alias the interview of the universal (lobian) 
<br />
machine, is only a more precise version of UDA so that a (universal) 
<br />
machine can understand it and present it in a refined testable way..
<br />
The diagonalizations I have done are needed if only just for explaining 
<br />
what is a Universal Machine, how they could exist, etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not that there's anything wrong with that, but we must acknowledge 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Bruno speaks a language that very few of us can understand
</em><br />
<br /><br />Mmmhh... I was hoping talking a language *all* can understand. The 
<br />
language of numbers and functions (elementary math). By &quot;all&quot; I mean 
<br />
all *universal entity* having a minimum introspective ability (and 
<br />
later even this sentence will shown to be &quot;understandable&quot; by universal 
<br />
*machine*, but this, of course, will need some amount of work). Of 
<br />
course I am sure you are a universal machine (at least), but this will 
<br />
be shown in due course.
<br />
<br />Norman, I would bet you have only a trouble with the math notations, 
<br />
not with the math itself. As a math teacher I know that about 
<br />
99.99999.... of those who thinks they have problems with math have only 
<br />
problem with notations  or with motivation. I would like to help you to 
<br />
transcend that notation problem. I guess you have a problem with the 
<br />
notation for functions, and perhaps you need no more than a reminding 
<br />
of the basic definitions.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll reply, &quot;Because your audience is shrinking!  I've plotted the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Audience vs. Topic, and find that, in 12.63 months, there is a 91% 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability that, if the topic doesn't become understandable to one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with an IQ of 120, your audience will be zero, and the only expositor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will be Bruno.
</em><br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;From this I can infer you have some knowledge on numbers. At least of 
<br />
the numbers 12.63,  91,  100, 120, 0 and 1.    :-)
<br />
<br />Well, I am sure you have some knowledge about the natural numbers:
<br />
<br />N   = the collection of all numbers like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
<br />
10, 11, 12, ...
<br />
<br />I guess you remember that the expression &quot;378&quot; denotes usually the 
<br />
number given by three times 100 added to seven times 10 added with 
<br />
eight times 1.  All right? So a number like 36 denotes really the 
<br />
number of strokes in the following diagram:
<br />
<br />| | | | | | | | | |
<br />
| | | | | | | | | |
<br />
| | | | | | | | | |
<br />
| | | | | |
<br />
<br />Three boxes of ten strokes, and a box of six strokes. All right?
<br />
In those arrangements the number ten plays a conventional role. Why 
<br />
ten? Probably because we have ten fingers(*).
<br />
<br /><br />One of the key notion in math is the notion of function. In our 
<br />
setting, we can begin to limit ourself to function from N to N. But 
<br />
first, what is a function?
<br />
A function from A to B is just anything which for each object in A 
<br />
associates one object in B. Here A = B = N, and thus, a function from N 
<br />
to N is an association of one number for each number.
<br />
If &quot;f&quot; is a name for some function, &quot;f(n)&quot; represents the value f 
<br />
associates to n. See examples below.
<br />
Now there is an infinity of numbers (cf N= {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}, so 
<br />
a function can be represented by an infinite table of values:
<br />
<br />Exemple: Hal Finney mentionned the factorial function: it associates to 
<br />
each number n, the product of all non nul numbers least or equal to n, 
<br />
except if n is null in which case the factorial of n is one, thus we 
<br />
have:
<br />
<br />Factorial(0) = 1
<br />
Factorial(1) = 1
<br />
Factorial(2) = 2
<br />
Factorial(3) = 3 times 2 = 6
<br />
Factorial(4) = 4 times 3 times 2 = 4 times 6 = 24
<br />
Factorial(5) = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 = 5 times 24 = 120
<br />
Etc.
<br />
<br />A function can be represented by an infinite set, which is just the set 
<br />
of all the associations provided by the function. Example:
<br />
<br />Factorial = {(0, 1) (1, 1) (2, 2), (3, 6) (4, 24) (5 120) (6, 720) ...}
<br />
<br />But function from N to N can also be represented just by their value on 
<br />
0, 1, 2, ...
<br />
<br />Factorial =  1  1  2  6  24  120  720 ...
<br />
<br />Other examples: the function Double which sends n on 2 times n:
<br />
<br />Double = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, ...
<br />
<br />Norman, are you ok with such a talk.
<br />
<br />Concerning the motivation, just remember that old name for a computer: 
<br />
a number crunching machine. Indeed, even if do some text processing 
<br />
with a computer, whatever you type on the keyboard can be coded or 
<br />
interpreted as a number, the working of the computer can be interpreted 
<br />
in term of a function from numbers to numbers, the output again is a 
<br />
number which can be (re)interpreted as a text.
<br />
<br />Norman, and all non mathematician, please tell me if you understand 
<br />
this post, before trying to read the &quot;diagonalization (solution)&quot; post.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll reply, &quot;Damn!  I was hoping to learn something!&quot;
</em><br />
<br />Tell me if this post helps, and in case it doesn't, tell me where you 
<br />
have a problem. If your problem bears on the philosophical motivation, 
<br />
please tell us (that is interesting too).
<br />
<br />We need just to define what is a bijection, and you will be ready for 
<br />
the diag posts.
<br />
<br /><br />Bruno
<br />
<br />(*)Not (currently) important remark; But it helps a lot for the 
<br />
learning  of how to separate accidental truth relying on the choice of 
<br />
the notation, and truth on numbers (or functions) which does not depend 
<br />
on the choice of notation. To be a &quot;round&quot; number, like 10, 20, ... is 
<br />
notation dependent. To be an odd number or to be a prime number is not 
<br />
dependent on the choice of notation. This can help to figure out the 
<br />
non conventional part of math.
<br />
<br />Could you find what &quot;378&quot; would represent for an extraterrestrial  
<br />
having only eight fingers? (assuming they allows one symbol by digit, 
<br />
and using like us 0 for the number of &quot;a&quot; in the word &quot;bbb&quot;, 1, for the 
<br />
number of &quot;a&quot; in the word &quot;babb&quot;, by 2 the number of &quot;a&quot; in the word 
<br />
&quot;bababb&quot;, etc. By 7 they mean of course the number of &quot;a&quot; in the word 
<br />
&quot;bbbbababababaaabbb&quot;. All right?
<br />
But they have only 8 digits, (four at each hand, for example). So they 
<br />
can use only (by our assumption that numbers are written with as many 
<br />
elementary symbols than we have digits) with the eight symbols: &quot;0&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;.
<br />
Like us they simplify the notation for numbers by packages. Only they 
<br />
use package of eight instead of ten. So for them, &quot;36&quot; will represent 
<br />
(3 times 8) + 6 = the number *we* are used to wrote &quot;30&quot;.
<br />
How then will they write our number 36, where the &quot;3&quot; means three 
<br />
packages of ten, and &quot;6&quot; means
<br />
six unities? well 36 = 32 + 4 = (4 times 8) + 4 = 44.
<br />
Can you count like an extraterrestrial who has only two fingers (one at 
<br />
each hand)? The answer is:
<br />
<br />0,
<br />
1,
<br />
10 = (1 times 2) + 0) = 2   (in base ten)
<br />
11 = (1 times 2) + 1) = 3
<br />
100 = (1 times 4) + 0 times 2 + 0 times 1) = 4
<br />
101 = 5
<br />
110 = 6
<br />
111 = 7
<br />
1000 = 8
<br />
1001 = 9
<br />
1010 = 10
<br />
1011 = 11
<br />
etc.  ... OK?
<br />
<br />...must go now,
<br />
<br />Bruno
