<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; when a particular ball is dropped.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, when the ball is dropped, in one universe it falls down, and Bob has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to agree with Alice, and in another universe it up, and Alice has to agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with Bob. Alice thinks the second universe is less important than the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first, but Bob thinks it's more important. How do you break this symmetry?
</em><br />
<br />By looking at my actual experiences, from a first-person point of view. If I 
<br />
drop the ball over and over again and consistently have the experience of 
<br />
seeing it drop, that suggests there's some kind of objective measure, 
<br />
independent of my own preferences, that assigns greater probability to 
<br />
versions of me experiencing the ball drop than to versions seeing it fly 
<br />
upwards.
<br />
<br />An objective measure would seem to be the only way to capture the notion 
<br />
that there is something about my experiences that is externally given, and 
<br />
not just a matter of my own arbitrary choices. Even if I choose a weird 
<br />
measure for the purposes of making decisions, like one that tells me I 
<br />
should bet my life savings that I will be able to fly, I don't think that 
<br />
would change the probability that my next experience will actually be that 
<br />
of flying, which I assume will stay very low regardless of what 
<br />
decision-theory measure I feel like choosing. Again, there seems to be an 
<br />
external reality guiding the probabilities of different experiences which I 
<br />
have no control over. Do you disagree? Do you think that by choosing a 
<br />
different measure, you could change the actual first-person probabilities of 
<br />
different experiences? Or do you reject the idea of continuity of 
<br />
consciousness and &quot;first-person probabilities&quot; in the first place?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Without an objective measure, I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; think there's any way to explain why we consistently see outcomes that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obey
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the known laws of physics (like why we always see dropped balls fall 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;towards
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the earth).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What good are the explanations provided by an objective measure, if I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;choose to use a different subjective measure for making decisions? How do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these explanations help me in any way?
</em><br />
<br />An objective measure would tell you the probability that you will actually 
<br />
have a particular experience in the future, even if that knowledge would 
<br />
have no influence on your decisions. But for most people, the probability of 
<br />
actually having future various future experiences probably *would* influence 
<br />
their decisions, no? For example, I am more likely to take a gamble that has 
<br />
a very low probability of leading to my experiencing pain in the future than 
<br />
one that has a high probability of leading to a pain-experience.
