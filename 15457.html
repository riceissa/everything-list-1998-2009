<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it's the pattern of bits that matters, not what created it (or

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;caused&quot; it, or &quot;computed it&quot;, etc.)
</em><br />
<br />Yes. Suppose one of the components in my computer is defective but,
<br />
with incredible luck, is outputting the appropriate signals due to
<br />
thermal noise. Would it then make sense to say that the computer isn't
<br />
&quot;really&quot; running Firefox, but only pretending to do so, reproducing
<br />
the Firefox behaviour but lacking the special Firefox
<br />
qualia-equivalent?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would help me if I had a clearer idea of how you view
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness. I assume that, for you, if someone flips the squares on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a Life board at random and creates the expected &quot;chaos&quot;, there's no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness there, but that there are certain configurations that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could arise (randomly) that you would consider conscious. I assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that these patterns would show some kind of regularity - some kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; law-like behavior.
</em><br />
<br />In the first instance, yes. But then the problem arises that under a
<br />
certain interpretation, the chaotic patterns could also be seen as
<br />
implementing any given computation. A common response to this is that
<br />
although it may be true in a trivial sense, as it is true that a block
<br />
of marble contains every possible statue, it is useless to define
<br />
something as a computation unless it can process information in a way
<br />
that interacts with its environment. This seems reasonable so far, but
<br />
what if the putative computation is of a virtual world with conscious
<br />
observers? The trivial sense in which such a computation can be said
<br />
to be hiding in chaos is no longer trivial, as I see no reason why the
<br />
consciousness of these observers should be contingent on the
<br />
possibility of interaction with the environment containing the
<br />
substrate of their implementation. My conclusion from this is that
<br />
consciousness, in general, is not dependent on the orderly physical
<br />
activity which is essential for the computations that we observe.
<br />
Rather, consciousness must be a property of the abstract computation
<br />
itself, which leads to the conclusion that the physical world is
<br />
probably a virtual reality generated by the big computer in Platonia,
<br />
since there is no basis for believing that there is a concrete
<br />
physical world separate from the necessarily existing virtual one.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's not easy for me to explain why I think it matters what kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process (or in Platonia, what kind of abstract computation) generated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that order. But it's also not easy for me to understand the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternative view. During those stretches of time when the random field
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of bits is creating a pattern that you would call conscious, what do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you *mean* when you say it's conscious? By definition, you can't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anything about how it's reacting to its environment, or that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing something &quot;because of&quot; something else, etc.
</em><br />
<br />I know what I mean by consciousness, being intimately associated with
<br />
it myself, but I can't explain it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I think there is a partial zombie problem regardless of whether
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Unification or Duplication is accepted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you elaborate on this? What partial zombie problem do you see that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Unification doesn't address?
</em><br />
<br />If by &quot;Unification&quot; you mean the idea that two identical brains with
<br />
identical input will result in only one consciousness, I don't see how
<br />
this solves the conceptual problem of partial zombies. What would
<br />
happen if an identical part of both brains were replaced with a
<br />
non-concious but otherwise identically functioning equivalent?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And do you think that the move away from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;physical reality&quot; to &quot;mathematical reality&quot; solves that problem? If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so, how?
</em><br />
<br />The Fading Qualia argument proves functionalism, assuming that the
<br />
physical behaviour of the brain is computable (some people like Roger
<br />
Penrose dispute this). Functionalism then leads to the conclusion that
<br />
consciousness isn't dependent on physical activity, as discussed in
<br />
the recent threads. So, either functionalism is wrong, or
<br />
consciousness resides in the Platonic realm.
