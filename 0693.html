<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Evolution must have had two &quot;choices&quot; when it programmed our brains to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; make decisions as they relate to death. It could have made death or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; circumstances leading to death painful and made us avoid actions that lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the subjective experience of pain, or it could have made us consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the effect of each of our potential actions on our measure and avoid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actions that lead to a decrease in measure. Apparently it chose the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; former, presumably because it's easier for evolution to accomplish. But
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because of this our genes are now in trouble because we have found ways to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kill ourselves painlessly.
</em><br />
<br />It might make more sense to consider evolution working on genes rather
<br />
than individuals.  Genes are not only evolved to keep their measure
<br />
from decreasing, but they evolve to increase their measure if possible
<br />
(considering a gene as an information pattern which is instantiated in
<br />
each organism which carries it).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what does this mean for us? Since subjective decision making is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; legacy of our evolutionary past, and can be shown to be less general than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective decision making, it should no longer be used. Therefore, QS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; advocates will have to come up with a new justification for ignoring one's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure. I don't think there is one. That doesn't mean one should care
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about one's measure, just that there is no reason why one shouldn't.
</em><br />
<br />Over time, if we switch from genes to minds as the units of evolution,
<br />
then we would expect minds which attempt to increase their measure (and
<br />
prevent its decrease) would become more prevalent.  Those which are
<br />
convinced by quantum suicide arguments are like genes which have given
<br />
up trying to reproduce; quickly removed from the pool.  (Of course in
<br />
an everything universe there are still some survivors off in a corner
<br />
somewhere.)
<br />
<br />If we're not going to ignore our measure, then we seem to have an
<br />
obligation to increase it rather than just keep it from decreasing.
<br />
Presently there is not much we can do about it (especially if the units
<br />
are observer-moments); perhaps recording our thoughts in great detail so
<br />
that future technology can resurrect and replay them would be partially
<br />
effective.  Alternatively, working to advance technologies for reading
<br />
brain states and emulating them on computers might be our best bet to
<br />
increase our measure.
<br />
<br />If we don't spend our time doing such things, isn't this almost as bad
<br />
as accepting quantum suicide?
<br />
