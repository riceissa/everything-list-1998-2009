</em><br />
<br /><br />It depends about what the decision theory is for. If the decision theory
<br />
is used by a subject for maximalising some gain, only that subject can
<br />
decide what is a gain for him, and this (as Kant realised) can only be
<br />
based on first person experiences, lived and expected.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To be honest I have not understand your answers to Hal Finney last posts,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I agree with Hall's remark though).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's probably because I haven't explained my current overall position.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'll try to do that now. Do you agree with the following?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1. All computational facts exist. In other words all statements of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;form &quot;the output of GTM x converges to y&quot; or &quot;the output of GTM x doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;converge&quot; have objective truth values.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. (This is entailed by any form of arithmetical platonism).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. Any statement that has a truth value is equivalent to a computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;statement.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Mmh...In general this is false. Most arithmetical truth are beyond
<br />
computational accessibility, unless you count those truth proved by
<br />
machine betting theories (the dreaming machines!).
<br />
But with some formalised and explicit version of computationalism
<br />
(like in AUDA) you can restrict arithmetical truth to the computationnaly
<br />
accessible arithmetical truth. This is what I do with my restriction
<br />
to Sigma_1 sentences (which are equivalent to sentences with the form:
<br />
&quot;it exists n such that P(n)&quot;, P being an algorithmically verifiable
<br />
statement. So OK (but with comp).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;For example &quot;1+1=2&quot; is equivalent to &quot;The output of x is '2'&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where x is a GTM for computing 1+1.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;I will win the lottery tomorrow with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;m-measure at least 1/2 of my current m-measure, where m is defines as ...&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is equivalent to &quot;The output of x converges to 'true'&quot; where x is a GTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that simulates all universes in parallel, while keeping track of an upper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bound on m(me-now) and a lower bound on m(me winning the lottery
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tomorrow), and outputing 'true' when the ratio between the two drops below
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;2. 
</em><br />
<br /><br />I'm not sure what you mean by the GTM (Great Turing Machine?). 
<br />
I partially agree with you in the sense that I know there is a Universal
<br />
Dovetailer capable of simulating all &quot;universes&quot; in parallel (+ all
<br />
dream of universes, etc...) and capable of generating all version of
<br />
&quot;me-now&quot;, but I stop here, because no Turing machine can keep track
<br />
of the &quot;me-now&quot;, and besides, even if such machine could exist (and
<br />
it cannot by a theorem of RICE) then for any UD you can build another
<br />
UD which will, on any finite portion of its execution, give
<br />
different ratio between the me-now and their continuations (only in the
<br />
infinite will the &quot;ratio&quot; be the same).
<br />
(RICE theorem say that no machine can decide in finite time if two
<br />
presented machine have or not the same behaviour). 
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3. Caring about anything is equivalent to caring about computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;facts.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK but not necessarily recognised as such.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, your goals are equivalent to goals in the form &quot;I want the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;output of GTM x to converge to y&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not necessarily because I cannot associate or name x even I know
<br />
I want y. Comp entails non computationalist facts in the neighborhood.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This goal makes sense if you are part
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the computation of x and can influence its history. The problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness, or the mind-body problem, then becomes how do I tell which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations I am a part of?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree.
<br />
I believe (both from QM and comp) that it is very plausible that
<br />
we belong to an infinity (even a continuum) of computations at once.
<br />
This entails the first person indeterminacy which takes the
<br />
form of a wave (apparently). Well that is what remains to be
<br />
explained for those who bet on comp.
<br />
I don't believe we belong to a unique computation or a unique universe
<br />
and that we should quantify on all universes, I believe we belongs
<br />
to a sheaf of &quot;universe-computations&quot; and that the indeterminacy is 
<br />
relative to what we know and don't know.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;There is no objective standard about what goals one should have, or how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much weight one should put on each goal.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Absolutely!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From this position it appears that there is no need or room for an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective measure.
</em><br />
<br /><br />??? This is exactly what I don't understand (and where I agree with
<br />
Finney's reply). 
<br />
<br />Once such or such person has some (subjective and personal) goals,
<br />
and has decided to put much weight on that goal, it seems to me that
<br />
it is better for him/her to take into account the most objective 
<br />
measure she/he can calculate or bet on his/her continuations.
<br />
Exemple: 1) my goal is to drink a hot coffee. I put a recipient of
<br />
water onto the stove (or cooker?). I use some implicite high measure
<br />
on the probable boiling water phenomenon.
<br />
2) I use teletransport everyday because I got a job on Mars.
<br />
Now the channel has been made secure (thanks to some quantum
<br />
protocol). My goal here is to make as little as possible the
<br />
probability of being duplicate without my consent by some sadical
<br />
channel-pirate in need of flesh (not chair!). So I decide to pay
<br />
the bill for the quantum protocol.
<br />
<br />I don't pretend we can know for sure any objective measure, but
<br />
from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics we do have made some
<br />
progress.
<br />
And all what I say is that with comp we have an a priori explosion of 
<br />
continuations, and if comp is true that explosion should not
<br />
be greater that the &quot;natural&quot; Everett MWI one, and should behave
<br />
in that same strange wavy way. After all QM *does* quantify on our 
<br />
(first person plural) ignorance, like comp say any ultimate &quot;physics&quot;
<br />
should do.
