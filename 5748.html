<br />
John Baez, a widely respected physicist, responds to the question,
<br />
is time quantized:
<br />
<br />&quot;The brief answer to this question is, 'Nobody knows.' Certainly there
<br />
is no experimental evidence in favor of such a minimal unit. On the
<br />
other hand, there is no evidence against it, except that we have not yet
<br />
found it. There are no well-worked-out physics theories incorporating
<br />
a fundamental unit of time, and there are substantial obstacles to
<br />
doing so in a way that is compatible with the principles of General
<br />
Relativity. Recent work on a theory of quantum gravity in which gravity is
<br />
represented using loops in space suggests that there might be a way to do
<br />
something roughly along these lines--not involving a minimum unit of time
<br />
but rather a minimum amount of area for any two-dimensional surface, a
<br />
minimum volume for any three-dimensional region in space and perhaps also
<br />
a minimum 'hypervolume' for any four-dimensional region of space-time.&quot;
<br />
<br />So I think it is an oversimplification to say that it is widely accepted
<br />
that time is quantized.  It is pretty clear that something strange
<br />
must happen as we go to smaller and smaller time and distance scales,
<br />
but nobody knows what.
<br />
<br />Tipler's Omega Point theory is basically a theory of general relativity
<br />
and I don't think it incorporates quantum mechanics.  So it has to
<br />
be viewed as extremely speculative on that basis, although the same
<br />
thing might be said of the Big Bang, or of discussion of black hole
<br />
singularities, both of which involve infinities much like the Omega
<br />
Point theory does.
<br />
<br />I'll tell you something else about the OP that most people don't know.
<br />
Many people may think of the universal collapse as providing an energy
<br />
source and/or effective time speedup which leads to this prediction
<br />
that an infinity of calculating can be done.  But this is not the case.
<br />
With overwhelming probability, a natural Big Crunch will not allow
<br />
for infinite calculations, rather only a finite amount of computation
<br />
is possible.
<br />
<br />The only way to get an infinite amount of calculation is for the collapse
<br />
to take a very special and peculiar form, in which the universe oscillates
<br />
unstably from one extreme shape to another.  Instead of collapsing as
<br />
a nice little ball getting smaller and smaller, the universe has to
<br />
stretch in first one direction, then another, ever more extensively.
<br />
<br />Such wild gyrations will not occur naturally, yet they are the only way
<br />
for infinite calculations to occur.  Only this will create the ever more
<br />
extreme temperature variations that can drive ever-faster calculations.
<br />
<br />Tipler's idea is that life itself will take over control of the
<br />
universe's collapse.  Just as we may some day control the weather by
<br />
predicting its course with extreme accuracy and modifying inputs to
<br />
make it do what we want, so, Tipler theorizes, life could control the
<br />
very shape of the universal collapse by measuring it, making short
<br />
and long term predictions, and then making small modifications to the
<br />
energy and matter under life's control in order to shape the path.
<br />
Since the universal collapse is a chaotic system, as is the weather,
<br />
it might theoretically be possible.
<br />
<br />Life's task will become ever more difficult as each oscillation of the
<br />
collapse occurs.  With each gyration, life must move more quickly and
<br />
accurately to keep the universe on its path.  A single slip-up anywhere
<br />
along the line and the potential for infinite calculation is lost.
<br />
And meanwhile the temperature is rising exponentially, threatening the
<br />
physical stability of whatever substrate of mass and energy life has
<br />
adopted to provide for continuity of existence.
<br />
<br />Oh, and I forgot to mention that life at one side of the universe can't
<br />
communicate with life at the other side.  Infinite computation may be
<br />
possible but not infinite communication.  The photons won't get there
<br />
before the collapse occurs.  So all of this delicate balancing act must be
<br />
accomplished without any global communication, each part of the universe
<br />
must act on faith that every other part is going to perform exactly those
<br />
steps required to make the whole thing come together and work perfectly.
<br />
All this is without any pre-arrangment beyond what we can accomplish in
<br />
this era.  We better get our acts together before we head out colonizing.
<br />
<br />Given these immense challenges, which increase in difficulty
<br />
and complexity literally without limit, improbability piled upon
<br />
impossibility, we can throw in the still-unknown difficulties implied
<br />
by quantum theory, and a wildly unlikely theory becomes that much less
<br />
plausible.
<br />
<br />Then of course there is the new problem that the Big Crunch no longer
<br />
is a plausible outcome, tossing Tipler's theories into the trash.
<br />
<br />In short, while the Omega Point theory was an interesting speculation
<br />
on how infinite computation might be possible in a universe based on
<br />
General Relativity, it was never very plausible and is much less so now.
