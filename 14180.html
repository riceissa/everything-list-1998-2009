Hi David, Hi John,
<br />
<br />OK, here is a first try. Let me know if this is too easy, too 
<br />
difficult, or something in between. The path is not so long, so it is 
<br />
useful to take time on the very beginning.
<br />
I end up with some exercice. I will give the solutions, but please try 
<br />
to be aware if you can or cannot do them, so as not missing the train.
<br />
<br />John, if you have never done what has been called &quot;modern math&quot;, you 
<br />
could have slight notation problem, please ask any question. I guess 
<br />
for some other the first posts in this thread could look too much 
<br />
simple. Be careful when we will go from this to the computability 
<br />
matter.
<br />
<br />I recall the plan, where I have added the bijection thread:
<br />
<br />Plan
<br />
<br />0) Bijections
<br />
1) Cantor's diagonal
<br />
2) Does the universal digital machine exist?
<br />
<br />And for much later, if people are interested or ask question:
<br />
<br />3) Lobian machines,  who and/or what are they?
<br />
4) The 1-person and the 3- machine.
<br />
5) Lobian machines' theology
<br />
6) Lobian machines' physics
<br />
7) Lobian machines' ethics
<br />
<br />But my main goal first is to explain that Church thesis is a very 
<br />
strong postulate. I need first to be sure you have no trouble with the 
<br />
notion of bijection.
<br />
<br />================
<br />
0) Bijections
<br />
<br />Suppose you have a flock of sheep. Your neighbor too. You want to know 
<br />
if you have more, less or the same number of sheep, but the trouble is 
<br />
that neither you nor your neighbor can count (nor anyone around).
<br />
<br />Amazingly enough, perhaps, it is still possible to answer that 
<br />
question, at least if you have enough pieces of rope. The idea consists 
<br />
in attaching one extremity of a rope to one of your sheep and the other 
<br />
extremity to one of the neighbor's sheep, and then to continue. You are 
<br />
not allow to attach two ropes to one sheep, never.
<br />
<br />In the case you and your neighbor have a different number of sheep, 
<br />
some sheep will lack a corresponding sheep at the extremity of their  
<br />
rope, so that their ropes will not be attached to some other sheep.
<br />
<br />Exemple (your flock of sheep = {s, r, t, u},  and the sheep of the 
<br />
neighborgh = {a, b, c, d, e, f}.
<br />
<br />s --------- a
<br />
r ---------- d
<br />
u --------- c
<br />
t ----------- f
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------e
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------b
<br />
<br />and we see that the neighbor has more sheep than you, because b and e 
<br />
have their ropes unable to be attached to any remaining sheep you have, 
<br />
and this because there are no more sheep left in your flock. You have 
<br />
definitely less sheep.
<br />
<br />In case all ropes attached in that way have a sheep well attached at 
<br />
both extremities, we can say that your flock and your neighbor's flock 
<br />
have the same number of elements, or same cardinality. In that case, 
<br />
the ropes represent a so called one-one function, or bijection, between 
<br />
the two flocks. If you have less sheep than your neighbor, then there 
<br />
is a bijection between your flock and a subset of your neighbor's 
<br />
flock.
<br />
<br />If those flocks constitute a finite set, the existence of a bijection 
<br />
between the two flocks means that both flocks have the same number of 
<br />
sheep, and this is the idea that Cantor will generalize to get a notion 
<br />
of &quot;same number of element&quot; or &quot;same cardinality&quot; for couples of 
<br />
infinite sets.
<br />
<br />Given that it is not clear, indeed,  if we can count the number of 
<br />
element of an infinite set, Cantor will have the idea of generalizing 
<br />
the notion of &quot;same number of elements&quot;, or &quot;same cardinality&quot; by the 
<br />
existence of such one-one function. The term &quot;bijection&quot; denotes 
<br />
&quot;one-one function&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />Definition: A and B have same cardinality (size, number of elements) 
<br />
when there is a bijection from A to B.
<br />
<br />Now, at first sight, we could think that all *infinite* sets have the 
<br />
same cardinality, indeed the &quot;cardinality&quot; of the infinite set N. By N, 
<br />
I mean of course the set {0, 1, 2,  3,  4,  ...}
<br />
<br />By E, I mean the set of even number {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ...}
<br />
<br />Galileo is the first, to my knowledge to realize that N and E have the 
<br />
&quot;same number of elements&quot;, in Cantor's sense. By this I mean that 
<br />
Galileo realized that there is a bijection between N and E. For 
<br />
example, the function which sends x on 2*x, for each x in N is such a 
<br />
bijection.
<br />
Now, instead of taking this at face value like Cantor, Galileo will 
<br />
instead take this as a warning against the use of the infinite in math 
<br />
or calculus.
<br />
Confronted to more complex analytical problems of convergence of 
<br />
Fourier series, Cantor knew that throwing away infinite sets was too 
<br />
pricy, and on the contrary, will consider such problems as a motivation 
<br />
for its &quot;set theory&quot;. Dedekind will even define an infinite set by a 
<br />
set which is such that there is a bijection between itself and some 
<br />
proper subset of himself.
<br />
<br />By Z, I mean the set of integers {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
<br />
<br />Again there is a bijection between N and Z.  For example,
<br />
<br />0  1  2  3  4  5    6  7  8  9  10 ....
<br />
0 -1 1 -2  2  -3   3  -4  4  -5  5 ...
<br />
<br />or perhaps more clearly (especially if the mail does not respect the 
<br />
&quot;blank&quot; uniformely; the bijection, like all function, is better 
<br />
represented as set of couples:
<br />
<br />bijection from N to Z = {(0,0) (1, -1) (2, 1) (3 -2) (4, 2) (5, -3) (6, 
<br />
3) ... }. Because everyone know the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... we 
<br />
can also describe a bijection between N and Z (say) just by the 
<br />
sequence of images:
<br />
<br />0 -1 1 -2  2  -3   3  -4  4  -5  5 ...
<br />
<br />That bijection can also be given by a rule: send even number x on x/2, 
<br />
and send odd numbers on x  -((x+1)/2). But it is not necessary to get 
<br />
those rules to be convinced, the drawing is enough once you interpret 
<br />
it genuinely.
<br />
<br /><br />By AXB, I mean the set of couples (x, y) with x in A and y in B. It is 
<br />
natural to put them in a cartesian plane.  For exemple, if A = {0, 1} 
<br />
and B = {a, b, c}, then AXB = {(0, a) (1, a) (0, b) (1, b) (0, c) (1, 
<br />
c)}, and is best represented by
<br />
<br />(0, c) (1, c)
<br />
(0, b) (1, b)
<br />
(0, a) (1, a)
<br />
<br />You see that if A is finite and has n elements and if B is finite and 
<br />
has m elements, then AXB is finite and has m*n elements. Yet, again, 
<br />
NXN &quot;has the same number of elements&quot; that N.
<br />
<br /><br />NXN is obviously the infinite extension of the following 4X4 
<br />
approximation:
<br />
<br />...
<br />
(0,3) (1,3) (2,3) (3,3)...
<br />
(0,2) (1,2) (2,2) (3,2)...
<br />
(0,1) (1,1) (2,1) (3,1)...
<br />
(0,0) (1,0) (2,0) (3,0)...
<br />
<br />Do you see a bijection between N and NXN ?
<br />
<br />Here is one, which I will call the zigzagger (draw the picture above 
<br />
and draw the link between the couples, a bit like in little children 
<br />
drawing puzzles, so as to see the zigzag clearly).
<br />
<br />(0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (2,0) (1,1) (0,2) (0,3) (1,2) (2,1) (3,0) (4,0) (3,1) 
<br />
(2,2) (1,3) (0,4) ...
<br />
<br />Here is another one, due to Cantor, I think. To draw it you will have 
<br />
to raise the pen.
<br />
<br />(0,0) (0,1) (1,0) (0,2) (1,1) (2,0) (0,3) (1,2) (2,1) (3,0) (0,4) (1,3) 
<br />
(2,2) (3,1) (4,0) ...
<br />
<br />The inverse of that bijection, which exists and is of course a 
<br />
bijection from NXN to N  has a nice quasi polynomial presentation.  (x, 
<br />
y) is send on the half of (x+y)^2 + 3x + y.
<br />
<br />You see that (4,0) is send to 14 (ok ?, it is not 13 because we start 
<br />
from zero), and indeed the half of (4+0)^2 + 3*4 +0 is 14.
<br />
<br />And ZXZ extends in a similar way :
<br />
<br />...
<br />
... (-3, 3) (-2, 3) (-1,3)   (0,3) (1,3)  (2,3)  (3,3)...
<br />
... (-3, 2) (-2, 2) (-1,2)   (0,2) (1,2)  (2,2)  (3,2)...
<br />
... (-3, 1)  (-2, 1) (-1,1)  (0,1) (1,1)  (2,1)  (3,1)...
<br />
... (-3,0)   (-2, 0)  (-1,0) (0,0) (1,0)  (2,0)  (3,0)...
<br />
... (-3,-1) (-2,-1)(-1,-1)  (0,-1) (1,-1) (2,-1) (3,-1)...
<br />
... (-3,-2) (-2,-2)(-1,-2)  (0,-2) (1,-2) (2,-1) (3,-2)...
<br />
... (-3,-3) (-2,-3)(-1,-3)  (0,-3) (1,-3) (2,-1) (3,-3)...
<br />
...
<br />
<br />Do you see a bijection between N and ZXZ ? Here is the 
<br />
spiral-bijection, or spiraler:
<br />
<br />(0,0) (0,1) (-1,1) (-1,0) (-1,-1) (0,-1) (1,-1) (1,0) (1,1) (1,2) (0,2) 
<br />
(-1,2) (-2,2) (-2,-1) ....
<br />
<br />You see: a bijection between N and ZXZ assigns to each natural number 
<br />
one and only one couple of integers, and this in such a way that we are 
<br />
sure that all couples of integers is the image of a natural number by 
<br />
that bijection.
<br />
<br /><br />Little exercises:
<br />
<br />1) is there a bijection between N and N?
<br />
<br />2) Q is the set of rational numbers, that is length of segment which 
<br />
can be measured by the ratio of natural numbers (or integers).
<br />
<br />(equivalently: = the real with repetitive decimals, like 
<br />
0,99999999...., or 345,78123123123123123...). By the way, could find n 
<br />
and m (in N) such that n/m = 345,78123123123123123... ? (and could you 
<br />
explain why 1,00000000.... = 0, 99999999....?). But this will not been 
<br />
used later.
<br />
<br />Can you see that there is a bijection between N and Q? Hint: transform 
<br />
the bijection between N and NXN into a bijection between N and Q.
<br />
<br />3) The disjoint union of two sets A and B = their formal union together 
<br />
with a relabelling so as to distinguish the elements: exemple:
<br />
<br />N disjoint-union-with N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} U {0', 1', 2', 3', ...}, 
<br />
which I will write N U N' (read: N union N prime).
<br />
<br />Is there a bijection between N and (with obvious notation) N U N' U N'' 
<br />
U N''' U ...?
<br />
<br />I will write NXNXN for NX(NXN)
<br />
<br />can you build a bijection between N and NXNXN ?
<br />
can you build a bijection between N and NXNXNXN ?
<br />
can you build a bijection between N and NXNXNXNXN ?
<br />
<br />4) Very important for the sequel. Let A be a finite alphabet (for 
<br />
exemple: A = {0,1}). Let us denote by A° the set of all finite words 
<br />
build on A. By a (finite) word a mean any finite sequence of elements 
<br />
taken in the alphabet (like 000, or 10101, or 1101000011010110). Is 
<br />
there a bijection between N and A°, with A = {0,1}.
<br />
<br />Solutions will be given later, but ask for question if there are any 
<br />
problem. Don't hesitate to tell me the mistakes, which always exist! 
<br />
You can also ask question about motivation, like, &quot;for God sake why are 
<br />
you explaining us all this&quot;. Try also to keep those posts for later 
<br />
considerations.
