Dear Jesse,
<br />
thanks for the cool and objective words.
<br />
I take it back (not what I said: I mean the topic) further. Our edifice of
<br />
physical science
<br />
is a wonderful mental construct, balanced by applied math, all on quantities
<br />
fitting the reduced models of historical observations from the hand-ax on.
<br />
Explanations grew out from all consecutive levels  of our epistemic
<br />
enrichment and served as indisputable basis for later explanations (even if
<br />
they 'corrected' them, like the more than a dozen entropies and still
<br />
counting). Assumptions make good basis for thousands of level in consecutive
<br />
build-up we still use 'atoms', 'molecules' 'gravity' 'electricity', 'photon'
<br />
etc. etc. as our basis. Then comes your judgement that one theory in this
<br />
building looks finer than another. The learned
<br />
(brainwashed) scientist-mind finds them as natural as fish the nonexistence
<br />
of water. The huge amount of knowledge blocks any naive (elementary)
<br />
scrutiny of the basics.
<br />
<br />I do not argue with your learned examples; within the system matches are
<br />
found especially quantitative ones, visualizing our select domain and
<br />
scale-restrictions.
<br />
'Observational evidence' is a belief in our up-to-date instrumental readings
<br />
explained INTO the theoretical faith as evidence. Wilson found the
<br />
&quot;background radiation&quot; because he had readings they were fitable and he new
<br />
about the idea of such possibility in view of the Big Bang (- assumption -
<br />
as we believe it today in our present cosmology). Eric Lerner's book (90s?)
<br />
presented some doubts (The Big Bang Never Was (title approximate) -) I added
<br />
some more upon my feeble thinking. How many &quot;ether&quot;s and &quot;phlogista&quot; do we
<br />
still have?
<br />
We got rid of &quot;elan vitale&quot; - but did we really?
<br />
I do not start a crusade against conventional science and understand the
<br />
reluctance of the practitioners to accept the endangerment of their wisdom.
<br />
Reductionist thinking (science) is the only one our mind is capable of
<br />
exercising (mine included), but I feel it is time to take a breath and a
<br />
wider view to elevate from the age-old concepts to the acceptance of
<br />
something else, without paradoxes, givens, axioms, in interconnection of
<br />
them all and ready for a change. Human science went through changes over the
<br />
millennia, even fundamental ones at times, there are more to come. I
<br />
remember the time when tachyon-observation was denied as false, because they
<br />
seemed FTL and this was prohibited. Theory over observed. I do not claim
<br />
that 'my views' are the call for a future, I did not invent them, just
<br />
picked up changing views (not so few on this list) and opened my mind to let
<br />
them in. Since I was not committed to the 'old' I had no problem. I allow
<br />
myself to be wrong and argue cautiously:
<br />
you may be right, I may be wrong, but I have to see that in a view broader
<br />
than the conventional physical teaching. I don't believe today my own
<br />
'macromolecules' I made and got patented, they are good within the old
<br />
theory. I saw 'effects' and applied the 'wisdom'  to explain them without
<br />
scrutiny. They worked. Not perfectly, as all we have has flaws (e.g.
<br />
airplanes fall out from the sky, medicines fail, buildings collapse, etc.,)
<br />
but we  are very confident in our science.  Well, I am not without scrutiny.
<br />
<br />I love assumptions: they push forward our advancement. Just do not allow
<br />
them to become facts and basis for many levels of consecutive conclusions
<br />
without a grain of salt.
<br />
<br />Your expressions (&quot;Most physicists believe&quot;, &quot;they are fairly confident&quot;,
<br />
or: &quot;general
<br />
relativity is a trustworthy theory of gravity&quot; and I do not go into
<br />
'gravity'. nor into the words of curvature of spacetime) are carefully
<br />
chosen. Religious people talk more straightforward in their religious
<br />
argumentation.
<br />
<br />Excuse my lengthy reply,  I enjoyed your argument.
<br />
Regards
<br />
<br />John M

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Cher Quentin,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;let me paraphrase (big):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;so someone had an assumption: BH. OK, everybody has the right to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fantasize.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Especially if it sounds helpful.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, the basic assumption was more broad than that: it was that general
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relativity is a trustworthy theory of gravity. There's plenty of evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that supports various predictions of GR which differ from Newtonian
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gravity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like the precession of the perihelion of Mercury's orbit, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gravitational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lensing of light near stars and galaxies, and gravitational time dilation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which can be measured at different altitudes on Earth (and it also needs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be taken into account when programming the clocks on board the orbiting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; GPS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; satellites). One of GR's predictions is that a sufficiently large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collapsing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; star will form a black hole (another is that the universe must be either
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expanding or contracting, which lead to the Big Bang theory once redshift
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was observed). Black holes were theorized for a while, then in the last
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decades they found observational evidence for a large number of likely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; black
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; holes with telescopes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Most physicists believe general relativity's predictions will cease to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accurate at the &quot;Planck scale&quot; of very short distances and times and very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high energy densities, and that at these scales it will need to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; replaced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a quantum theory of gravity. So although they are fairly confident that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; GR is correct about large collapsing stars forming a black hole with an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;event horizon&quot; and a size proportional to its mass (given by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'Swarzschild radius'), they think that the prediction of a singularity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite density at the center could be wrong, and that we'll need a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of quantum gravity to understand what's really going on there.
