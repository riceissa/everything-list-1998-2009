</em><br />
call
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a machine. There is no norm in the existence for 'reasonable', as

Cohen
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Stewart showed in their chef d'oeuvre on Chaos in the imaginary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Zarathustrans&quot;.  We, with our 100 years ahead thinking and Bruno with
</em><br />
his
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 200 should be above such narrowminded limitations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2.to your 'delusion': it is correct&lt;G&gt;.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, but even with a normative definition of &quot;rational&quot;(if that is what
<br />
you mean) there are those who are either unable (due to illness, or
<br />
because they are infants, for example) or unwilling (due to expediency,
<br />
or laziness, or whatever) to be rational. Moreover, this is very common,
<br />
not just an exception to the rule.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; )&quot;...The single best test is to treat someone with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; antipsychotic medication and see if the delusion goes away.&quot;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is this to implant new delusions and see how the poor fellow reacts?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We had some intelligent dicussions about 'everybody is crazy' (George
</em><br />
at
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; al.) and so &quot;crazy&quot; is 'normal' and the &quot;norm&quot; may be crazy. Are the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; psych-professionals exceptions?
</em><br />
<br />Let me give you a real example. A patient claims that in the last month,
<br />
whenever he is away, or asleep, someone comes into his house and does
<br />
annoying things, like shifting personal items from one place to another,
<br />
putting holes in his socks, opening cupboards that were closed or
<br />
closing cupboards that were open, and so on. The culprit must know a lot
<br />
about electronic surveillance, because the cameras the poor victim has
<br />
installed do not show evidence of intrusion, and the neighbours might
<br />
also be involved because they all say they have seen nothing unusual,
<br />
even though it is happening almost every day. The patient stops going to
<br />
work or socializing, and drinks endless cups of coffee in order to stay
<br />
up as long as possible and catch the intruder, but it's no use: the
<br />
incidents become more frequent and more brazen. Finally, when the
<br />
patient starts talking about homicidal and suicidal impulses, his family
<br />
contact the local psychiatric crisis team, who make a diagnosis of
<br />
schizophreniform psychosis and persuade the patient to start taking
<br />
aripiprazole 15mg mane, which they supervise by visiting daily. The
<br />
patient only agrees to this because the alternative would be involuntary
<br />
hospital admission: he can explain, in great detail, why he is convinced
<br />
that the intruder is real, and to be fair, there is no way the
<br />
psychiatric team can prove him wrong, or be completely certain that he
<br />
is wrong. 
<br />
<br />Two weeks later, the alleged intrusions have almost completely stopped,
<br />
and our patient is thinking about going back to work again. He argues it
<br />
has nothing to do with the medication: maybe the culprit was scared off
<br />
by the psychiatric team, or maybe he just got sick of annoying him.
<br />
<br />Two years later, the patient has gone through a cycle of stopping and
<br />
starting the medication half a dozen times. Within a few weeks of
<br />
stopping, the intrusions start up again, and within a few weeks of
<br />
recommencing treatment, they stop. He still isn't convinced that he has
<br />
ever been paranoid, but to stop his family and psychiatric services from
<br />
nagging him, he agrees to stay on the medication indefinitely, and he
<br />
remains well.
<br />
<br />Given this story, are you still prepared to say that the patient's
<br />
reasoning that strangers are putting holes in his socks is just as valid
<br />
as that of the psychiatric team or his concerned family? It's worth
<br />
noting that his *deductive* reasoning remained intact throughout, so if
<br />
you could use this to explain logically where his *inductive* reasoning
<br />
went wrong, you might have saved the state the cost of an expensive
<br />
antipsychotic.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; An unreasonable machine would look like a brain. The minds of living

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; organisms, such as they are, evolved ...&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because we know so little about the ways a brain works and assume too
</em><br />
much
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on our present ignorance to explain everything still unknown.
</em><br />
There
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the terror of physicists forcing their primitive model on the world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; especially on domains where SOME features can be measured in
</em><br />
established
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'phisics-invented' concepts by the so fa &quot;physics-invented&quot;
</em><br />
instruments
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; read in &quot;physics-invented&quot; units, although the conclusions come from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'non-physics-related' activities (mentality, ideation, feelings,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;delusions&quot;, etc.,) all having parallel and physically measurable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phenomena
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the neurological &quot;sciences&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we use the 'brain' as a tool and have no idea how it works and for
</em><br />
what.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In your quoted fragment I feel an equating of brain and mind, which I
</em><br />
find
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at least premature. I don't know what a &quot;mind&quot; may be. I &quot;know&quot;(?) it
</em><br />
must
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be both atemporal and aspatial, while the material of the brain is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagined
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (physically) to be space and time related.
</em><br />
<br />The mind is not the same as the brain, of course, but the two are
<br />
connected. We know that whenever certain complex physical processes
<br />
which we call &quot;brain activity&quot; occur, certain other mysterious processes
<br />
which we call &quot;mind activity&quot; also occur. Is that a fair enough
<br />
statement?
