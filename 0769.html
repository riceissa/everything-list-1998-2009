<br />What might that be?  The Omega Point?  But evidence is mounting
<br />
that the universe is open, and that the expansion is accelerating.
<br />
<br />I call it Omega Zero. The acceleration of expansion will eventually
<br />
produce a precise model of the future in the same way that we now model
<br />
the past with the big bang. Imagine a small circle in front of you the
<br />
size of a pea. It expands outward rapidly. You stay at its edge. It
<br />
becomes the size of the Earth, a galaxy, a super cluster. You can no
<br />
longer detect curvature yet it is still there. The circumference of the
<br />
circle never reaches that extreme of being perfectly straight which you
<br />
can imagine exists between the circle in front of you and an identical
<br />
one behind you. Imagine if you could form a straight line, holding your
<br />
arms out perfectly straight, opposed to the curvature of the circle.
<br />
This represents a straight line, an extreme seemingly impossible result
<br />
of expansion.
<br />
<br />Now imagine two points along the curved line of the circle in front of
<br />
you, then imagine them expanding away from one another at the speed of
<br />
light. What have you got? Flatness; zero curvature, which happens also
<br />
to be the point of zero temperature, zero energy, zero density, zero
<br />
mass, zero time, zero volume, along with maximum expansion and entropy.
<br />
<br />(C.S Lewis)
<br />
Life is not like a pool but like a tree. It does not move toward
<br />
unity but away from it and the creatures grow further apart as they
<br />
increase in perfection. Good, as it ripens, becomes continually
<br />
more different not only from evil [ignorance] but from other good
<br />
[wisdom].
<br />
<br />Great insight but I think its said knowing only half of the fundamental
<br />
process of ordered systems. Imagine a game of checkers in front of you
<br />
set to play. All the reds grouped and all the blacks grouped is an
<br />
ordered pattern. Now imagine all the pieces moving on their own toward a
<br />
different ordered pattern (red, black, red, black), a pattern where the
<br />
pieces match the checkered  pattern of the board. In the transition from
<br />
one ordered pattern to the other their was chaos and divergence. One way
<br />
of ordering things was destroyed in order to create the other pattern.
<br />
My best piece of work is the theory that rather than order and disorder,
<br />
there are two kinds of order in nature. It happens that the order of one
<br />
kind is the disorder of the other. Of course, what goods a theory if no
<br />
one else is able to recognize its significance.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;How does our response change if we factually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know that the observer exists beyond death?
</em><br />
<br />Beg your pardon?  I certainly don't think the observer exists
<br />
beyond death.  I would substitute something else for the preposition
<br />
&quot;beyond&quot;, maybe &quot;beside&quot;.
<br />
<br />You can imagine the lives &quot;beside&quot; but you can't imagine &quot;in front of&quot;,
<br />
or &quot;in series with&quot;. What is it called when people reject an idea
<br />
because it feels too familiar to ideas they reject for unrelated
<br />
reasons. A good scientist doesn't polarize with such things as religious
<br />
beliefs; wishful thinking with no reasonable grounds, but rather, is not
<br />
influenced one way or the other. Scientists themselves harbor a vast
<br />
number of biases, establish political incorrectness, fears, and
<br />
expectations that are not always rational.
<br />
<br />The general reaction to your post revealed the measure to which those in
<br />
this group imagine and believe in the ideas being discussed concerning
<br />
the actuality of MWs. To most here, discussing these issues is a game,
<br />
just a technical following of theory. A way to exercise their mind,
<br />
their personality, their abilities. There is no real belief, no
<br />
heightened sense of the actuality of what surrounds us; what confronts
<br />
us. Soon as things get uncomfortable or unfamiliar, and the present
<br />
foundation shifts, instead of exploring, the imagination ceases up. That
<br />
is why I stayed up till five in the morning writing that last post,
<br />
because I was so sparked by the exposure.
<br />
<br />Well, it was nice to get a response.
