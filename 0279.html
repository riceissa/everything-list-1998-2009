<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like your fellow death-worshipers on this list, you have a very
<br />
mixed-up understanding of measure.  So once again I will take you guys to
<br />
school.  The class is RM 102 - Remedial Measure Theory.
<br />
<br />RM102 Syllabus:
<br />
1.	Historical background
<br />
2.	Effective probabilities
<br />
3.	Actual or 'unnormalized' measure
<br />
4.	The infinite universe model
<br />
5.	Application to quantum suicide
<br />
6.	Final Exam
<br />
<br />1.	The term comes from the mathematical theory of measures, of which
<br />
probability theory is a subset.  A probability is treated as a measure on
<br />
a set of events with the additional properties that the sum of the
<br />
probabilities is 1 and that they are nonnegative.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first use of the term 'measure' in the sense of this class,
<br />
related to effective probabilities, was in the 1957 thesis of Everett.
<br />
This simple concept is a prerequisite for understanding the basic concepts
<br />
of the MWI.
<br />
<br />2.	An effective probability is just what it sounds like, and replaces
<br />
the stochastic concept of probability found in single-world interpretations.
<br />
A typical observer should expect his observations to be as though they
<br />
were drawn from a probability distribution of observations equal to the
<br />
effective probability distribution.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By definition, the effective probability of an observation is
<br />
proportional to its measure.  Effective probability is fractional measure,
<br />
normalized so that the sum is 1.
<br />
<br />3.	Actual or 'unnormalized' measure is the actual amount of an
<br />
certain observation present in a model.  Only measure ratios affect
<br />
effective probabilities, but actual measure is also important.  In a
<br />
computationalist interpretation, actual measure of a computation is equal
<br />
to the number of implementations of a computation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By definition, if two people agree on the measure distribution for
<br />
a model, they agree both on all predictions (given by the effective
<br />
probabilities) and on how much consciousness is present in that model.
<br />
<br />4.	An infinite universe with a single-world interpretation is a
<br />
useful model, because it is easy to follow what is happening, and because
<br />
by (3.) only the measure distribution of a model is relevant to any
<br />
analysis of behavior relating to consciousness.
<br />
<br />5.	When an individual U chooses to commit suicide at time t, assume
<br />
he has an effective chance p of succeeding, as measured by an external
<br />
observer.  As usual, assume that the measure of an observation is
<br />
proportional to the number of observers in that branch of the
<br />
wavefunction, times the squared amplitude of that branch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the effects of the suicide, as opposed to what would
<br />
happen if U never attempted it?
<br />
-	The effective probability of an observation being one of those
<br />
associated with U is decreased.
<br />
-	The conditional effective probability, given an observation
<br />
associated with U, that it is after time t is decreased.
<br />
-	The total measure in the universe is decreased, and all of the
<br />
decrease is in the total measure of U's observations.  In sum, it is a
<br />
costly act for U.
<br />
<br />6.	Final Exam.  Are the circumstances under which it is a good idea
<br />
to commit suicide the same in the MWI as they would be in a single world
<br />
interpretation?  (Hint: you can use the infinite universe, single world
<br />
model for the MWI.)
