<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand why you consider the measures of the programs that do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulations. The ''real'' measure should be derived from the algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity of the laws of physics that describe how the computers/brains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work. If you know for certain that a computation will be performed in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe, then it doesn't matter how it is performed.
</em><br />
<br />I think what you're saying here is that if a mental state is instantiated
<br />
by a given universe, the contribution to its measure should just be
<br />
the measure of the universe that instantiates it.  And that universe's
<br />
measure is based on the complexity of its laws of physics.
<br />
<br />I used to hold this view, but I eventually abandoned it because of a
<br />
number of problems.  I need to go back and collect the old messages
<br />
and discussions that we have had and put them into some kind of order.
<br />
But I can mention a couple of issues.
<br />
<br />One problem is the one I just wrote about in my reply to Russell, the
<br />
fuzziness of the concept of implementation.  In at least some universes
<br />
we may face a gray area in deciding whether a particular computation,
<br />
or more specifically a particular mental state, is being instantiated.
<br />
Philosophers like Hans Moravec apparently really believe that every
<br />
system instantiates virtually every mental state!  If you look at the
<br />
right subset of the atomic vibrations inside a chunk of rock, you can
<br />
come up with a pattern that is identical to the pattern of firing of
<br />
neurons in your own brain.  Now, most philosophers reject this, they come
<br />
up with various technical criteria that implementations have to satisfy,
<br />
but as I wrote to Russell I don't think any of these work.
<br />
<br />The other problem arises from fuzziness in what counts as a &quot;universe&quot;.
<br />
The problem is that you can write very simple programs which will
<br />
create your mental state.  For example, the Universal Dovetailer does
<br />
just that.  But the UD program is much smaller than what our universe's
<br />
physical laws probably would be.  Does the measure of the UD &quot;count&quot; as a
<br />
contribution to every mind it creates?  If so, then it will dominate over
<br />
the contributions from more conventional universes; and further, since
<br />
the UD generates all minds, it means that all minds have equal measure.
<br />
To reject the UD as a cheating non-universe means that we will need a
<br />
bunch of ad hoc rules about what counts as a universe and what does not,
<br />
which are fundamentally arbitrary and unconvincing.
<br />
<br />Then there are all those bothersome disputes which arise in this model,
<br />
such as whether multiple instantiations should add more measure than
<br />
just one; or whether a given brain in a small universe should get more
<br />
measure than the same brain in a big universe (since it uses a higher
<br />
proportion of the universe's resources in the first case).  All these
<br />
issues, as well as the ones above, are addressed and answered in my
<br />
current framework, which is far simpler (the measure of a mental state
<br />
is just its Kolmogorov measure - end of story).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The algorithmic complexity of the program needed to simulate a brain refers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to a ''personal universe''. You can think of the brain as a machine that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simulating a virtual world in which the qualia we experience exist. That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world also exists independent of our brain in a universe of its own. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world has a very small measure defined by the very large algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complexity of the program needed to specify the brain.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with this, I think.  The program needed to specify a mental state
<br />
a priori would be far larger than the program needed to specify the laws
<br />
of physics which could cause that mental state to evolve &quot;naturally&quot;.
<br />
Both programs make a contribution to the measure of the mental state,
<br />
but the second one's contribution is enormously greater.
<br />
<br />The key point, due to Wei Dai, is that you can mathematically treat the
<br />
two on an equal footing.  As you have described it, we have a virtual
<br />
world with qualia being created by a brain; and you have that same
<br />
world existing independently as a universe of its own.  Those are pretty
<br />
different in a Schmidhuber type model.  The second case is the output of
<br />
one of the universe programs (a very very complex one).  The first case
<br />
is a rather intangible property of a universe program much like our own.
<br />
<br />To unify them we ask the question of how we can output a representation
<br />
of that virtual world with qualia, using the shortest possible program.
<br />
Assuming that there actually is a universe which naturally evolves
<br />
a brain experiencing this mental state, we can do it with a two-part
<br />
program: the first which creates and evolves the universe, and the second
<br />
which analyzes the output of that universe to output the virtual world
<br />
representation we seek.  This second part basically translates the brain
<br />
activity, part of the universe created by the first part, into whatever
<br />
reprsentation we have chosen for the virtual world and qualia.
<br />
<br />Given that the universe created by the first part does evolve the
<br />
brain states needed as input for the second part, the second part can
<br />
be a relatively simple translation from physical to mental states.
<br />
Therefore we can create a short program which outputs the virtual world
<br />
and qualia in all its glory, and this short, two-part program will be
<br />
the main contribution to the measure of that mental experience.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that in this framework, we do not start with this two-part
<br />
structure.  The starting point is much simpler: all we want to know
<br />
is, what is the Kolmogorov complexity of a mental experience?  It is
<br />
only once we begin analyzing the problem that we note as you did that
<br />
building that mental experience as a universe of its own would require
<br />
an enormously large program.  And then we realize that we can make a
<br />
much smaller program - with exactly the same output! - that has the two
<br />
part structure I described here.  We deduce that such a program is what
<br />
is actually responsible for the measure of the experience.
<br />
<br />And from this we conclude that the contribution of a universe to the
<br />
measure of a conscious experience is not the universe's measure itself,
<br />
but that measure reduced by the measure of the program which outputs
<br />
that conscious experience given the universe data as input.  This then
<br />
leads to the principle that a big brain in a small universe gets more of
<br />
that universe's measure; that multiple instantiations of a consciousness
<br />
within a universe mean more measure; and that fuzziness of the concept
<br />
of an instantiation is no problem because it only affects the size of
<br />
the numbers being multiplied together to get the measure contribution.
<br />
<br />As for the question above about the Universal Dovetailer universe, it is
<br />
easily solved in this framework.  The output of the UD is of essentially
<br />
no help in producing the mental state in question, because the ouput is
<br />
so enormous and we would have no idea where to look.  Hence the UD does
<br />
not make a dominant contribution to mental state measure and we avoid
<br />
the paradox without any need for ad hoc rules.
