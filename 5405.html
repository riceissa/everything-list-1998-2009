<br />Mine be not teachings, but only musings. Your thoughts
<br />
impress me as fully 180 to those musings and I am not so
<br />
sure that either of our musings are lacking in substantial
<br />
basis of experiment!

<br />

</em><br />
<br />I can not follow that logic, friend John. I can not hold to
<br />
the philosophical viewpoint that the universe exists because
<br />
it is envisioned. My opinion is 180 to that: all that exists
<br />
does so because the universe is so constructed as to have
<br />
made existence probable. Not certain, but merely probable
<br />
and perhaps not enduring. It is not necessary to think in
<br />
order for something to be true or false. Imagining the
<br />
number zero (nothingness) does not change its attribute.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Zero energy could not start anything, a universe has got
</em><br />
to
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get started. Do you assign that to &quot;outside&quot; factors only?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Or - as seen below - a nihilistic solipsism?
</em><br />
<br />No, I've not meant to infer that the self is the only
<br />
reality, nor do I mean to infer that values are baseless and
<br />
that nothing can be known or communicated.
<br />
<br />But yes, I did speculate to &quot;outside&quot; factors; I impute to
<br />
the other side of the boundary of our expanding universe
<br />
(the nothingness). Zero energy does not rule out
<br />
perturbation (virtual particles) as long as those
<br />
perturbations cease to exist. The difficult thing to confer
<br />
is the thought that space/time and matter/energy are 2
<br />
different things, unrelated to each other, and both are
<br />
constrained within the boundary of the perturbation. The
<br />
other side of the boundary, the domain of zero energy, seeks
<br />
for the perturbation to cease existence; it seeks for the
<br />
virtual particles to annihilate so that the average
<br />
condition of zero energy is maintained over eternity.
<br />
<br />But how can zero energy be expressed to have a factor called
<br />
eternity? In truth, it can not because space/time and
<br />
matter/energy do not exist within zero energy. Such terms
<br />
belong only within the boundary of a perturbation. From the
<br />
viewpoint of zero energy a perturbation both does, and does
<br />
not, happen simultaneously (it is only a probability).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I conceptualize 'my' multiverse as fluctuations of
</em><br />
inevitable
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stress-seeds in a Plentiude of Everything in total dynamic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exchange, an infinite symmetry where the completeness of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diversity produces violations of the invariance =
</em><br />
BigBangs,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; i.e. fluctuations into universes which re-dissipate into
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; symmetry in a timeless manner. This is outside the
</em><br />
boundaries
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of our universe.
</em><br />
<br />That is a lot to say in so few words! By total dynamic
<br />
exchange, do you mean equilibrium? If so, could equilibrium
<br />
be equivalent to zero energy? What are the attributes of
<br />
this symmetry? How to define that boundary of our universe?
<br />
What causes existence of stress-seeds?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The dissipating &quot;stress-seeds&quot;, however, are called 'energy'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the reductionist physics. So I disagree with your zero-energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; startup and only the endup is such when &quot;universe&quot; also 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disappears in the Plenitude.
</em><br />
<br />What causes the dissipation of stress-seeds? I do not yet
<br />
understand why you disagree, as those questions are not
<br />
resolved to my benefit.

&quot;The idea is that you could understand the world, all of
<br />
nature, by examining smaller and smaller pieces of it. When
<br />
assembled, the small pieces would explain the whole&quot; (John
<br />
Holland)
