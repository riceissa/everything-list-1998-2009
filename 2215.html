<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;If he believes the MWI however, then he knows there is a branch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;where a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;deer turns up and one where it doesn't.  He knows that for a usual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;day the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;effective probability of a deer turning up is about 1%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;Since he has no reason to believe the laws of nature are specially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;configured to correlate the amplitude of the wavefunction's branches 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;his actions (especially since such correlation would be hard to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;reconcile 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;with QM), he will still believe the effective probability of a deer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;turning 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt;up is just 1%.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You may be confusing subjective and objective probability.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Nope.  Why would you think I might do so?
</em><br />
<br />Adam might have reason to think that the objective chance of Deer is 1%, 
<br />
and nonetheless have reason assign a 90% (say) credence to Deer. Compare 
<br />
the situation to the case of a coin which has just been tossed in what 
<br />
you think is a fair manner; so you think there was a 50% chance of 
<br />
Heads. But suppose you have cought a brief glimps of the coin after it 
<br />
landed, and it looked like Tails, although you aren't absolutely sure. 
<br />
So your subjective credence may be 95%.
<br />
<br />David Lewis discusses the relation between objective chance and 
<br />
subjective credence. The upshot is that one should only set one's 
<br />
subjective credence equal to the objective chance if (1) one knows about 
<br />
the objective chance, and (2) one does not have impermissible evidence - 
<br />
such as having seen how the coin landed, but there are more subtle forms 
<br />
of inadmissible evidence as well.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    In both cases I have so far discussed, his Bayesian probaility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distribution for the objective probability is sharply peaked about a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(stochastic xor effective) probability of 1%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    A common way this might occur is if he has observed, over the 
</em><br />
course of 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;10 years (3652 days) that about 37 times a deer has turned up.  If he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumes that there is a fixed probability p, and initially has a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uniform 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bayesian distribution for p on (0,1), then his final distribution will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sharply peaked about 1%.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    The point, here, is that in such a case he *can't* suddenly assume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;today is different, so while on a usual day p=.01, I'll just have a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;uniform 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bayesian prior for p_today.&quot;, and then apply the &quot;Adam paradox&quot;.  So, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both the non-MWI and the MWI case, p~=.01 is his prior probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;before he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;considers his own situation regarding reproduction, but the effect of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;latter is different.  So far I think you agree with that.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think that's right so far. But prior probability is not the same 
<br />
as objective probability. If there is a wounded deer in the 
<br />
neighborhood, then the objective chance may be quite high (say, 78%). 
<br />
But Adam doesn't know whether there is such a deer in the neighboorhood, 
<br />
so his subjective credence that the objective chance is that high, is 
<br />
low (say 0.1%). So he shouldn't think that a deer will turn up; that has 
<br />
a low prior probability. But when he forms the appropriate reproductive 
<br />
intentions, then (assuming SSA with a universal reference class), he 
<br />
obtain reason to think that the objective chance is actually quite high. 
<br />
This also results in his subjective credence in Deer increases.
<br />
<br />(Note that I'm talking about an objective chance here which varies from 
<br />
day to day, depending on what the deer in the region are up to. The more 
<br />
deer nearby, the greater the objective physical chance that some will 
<br />
pass by Adam's cave within a certain time interval.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If there are all these other fat branches in the world, then yes, I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;agree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;with that. However, Adam and Eve were there from the beginning, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;before 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;there deer paths had begun to spread out much as a probability cloud 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the terrain. Or at least we can suppose they were - that's the nice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;thing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;about thought experiments!
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But it would be foolish of Adam to believe that.  Take his name, &gt;for 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;example.  (Other examples are easily found.)  There are millions of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;names he could have had.  The laws of physics (or initial conditions) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have to be set up in a very contrived way in order for the effective 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability of just the one name for the first man, Adam, to be of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one.  Of course, in the biblical story things are very contrived 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some guy (god) contrived it, and because this original guy was himself 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;unique to start with.  It's not a coincidence that such a situation is 
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;implausible, and even if it was true, only a fool would believe it.  
</em><br />
<br />Let's suppose then that Adam was a fool in that respect. It's irrelevant 
<br />
to the point of the gedanken. (Besides, I don't think Adam needs to have 
<br />
been that foolish, if we assume that he has had the right sorts of 
<br />
revelations etc., and no exposure to other religions; in such cases, a 
<br />
reasonable man might easily be led to believe in the christian God.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;And I do find the premise that he can be certain that no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;type of MWI can be true hard to swallow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;He wouldn't have to be certain about that.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Well, he would certainly have to assign a ludicrously high 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(e.g. 50%) to the idea that the MWI might be false.
</em><br />
<br />1. That is not ludicrous even today.
<br />
2. Adam might not know contemporary physics.
<br />
3. Adam would not have to assign a 50% probability to MWI being false; 
<br />
as long as there's some finite chance, one would get a shift in his 
<br />
posterior probabilty after forming the intention, and that is the point 
<br />
of the gedanken.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You still haven't presented any way to determine the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;proper &quot;reference class&quot;.  I suggest you use the logical approach: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;include 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;all observers.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I don't see what's so particularly &quot;logical&quot; about that. In either 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;case, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;have to deal with borderline cases and such, and make some seemingly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;arbitrary postulations.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Much less so if all observers are included.  And it's certainly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simpler 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than any alternative.
</em><br />
<br />We don't know that yet, since we haven't figured out what the 
<br />
alternatives are.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    As I see it, it is a priori possible that I could have been any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer.  Thus all observers must be included, by definition.
</em><br />
<br />I find the &quot;I could have been you&quot; talk quite suspicious and murky. It's 
<br />
not clear to me that this is the way to cast light on the situtation.
