<br /><br />You are welcome. You know on these matters we can never be sure :-)
<br />
<br />Now when you say that the first person is all there is I am not sure it 
<br />
fits nicely with
<br />
the methodology I am following. I am not sure I understand why you don't 
<br />
need the UD,
<br />
given that the UD is just a nice third person description of the comp 
<br />
plenitude.
<br />
[That such a thing could exist is a highly non trivial consequence of the 
<br />
closure of
<br />
the set of programmable functions for the diagonalization: the existence of 
<br />
a universal
<br />
machine. (The Post Turing discovery)]. Cf the diagonalization posts.
<br />
<br />You could as well just say you don't need comp. (But I use comp to just 
<br />
benefits from
<br />
computer science and mathematical logic taking into account Post Turing 
<br />
Church ...Solovay).
<br />
The first person essentially will be an intuitionist/constructivist 
<br />
machine, a self-extending
<br />
entity which goes through locally anti-symmetric sequences of knowledge states.
<br />
Physics seems to appears in the &quot;first person plural&quot; (where vast 
<br />
collection of interacting
<br />
machines are &quot;multiplied&quot;), but the last discovery ---(that a quantum
<br />
logic [even an infinity*] appears in the pure singular first person pov)--- 
<br />
surely makes
<br />
me more open to the importance of the pure (intuitionist) first person.
<br />
Please recall me your feelings about the comp hyp in the cognitive 
<br />
science/philosophy
<br />
of mind, if you mind.
<br />
I use comp if only because my more primary goal is to show that some hypothesis
<br />
could make some &quot;theological&quot; question empirically testable.
<br />
<br />Bruno
<br />
<br />* That infinity of QL (Quantum Logic) converging toward CL (Classical logics)
<br />
could be a form of *arithmetical decoherence* as experimented by all sound
<br />
Universal Machine with respect to their  normal neighborhoods/consistent 
<br />
extensions.
<br />
You should study logic just to see the beauty. (Or the error! This material 
<br />
is new,
<br />
and has not been verified by someone else. Caution.)
