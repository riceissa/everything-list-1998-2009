<br />
Bruno recently urged me to read up on Tim Maudlin's movie-graph argument
<br />
against the computational hypothesis. I did so. Here is my version of the
<br />
argument.
<br />
............................
<br />
<br />According to the computational hypothesis, consciousness supervenes on brain
<br />
activity and the important level of organization in the brain is its
<br />
computational structure. So the same consciousness can supervene on two
<br />
different physical systems provided that they support the same computational
<br />
structure. For example, we could replace every neuron in your brain with a
<br />
functionally equivalent silicon chip and you would not notice the
<br />
difference.
<br />
<br />Computational structure is an abstract concept. The machine table of a
<br />
Turing Machine does not specify any physical requirements and different
<br />
physical implementations of the same machine may not be comparable in terms
<br />
of the amount of physical activity each must engage in. We might enquire:
<br />
what is the minimal amount of physical activity that can support a given
<br />
computation, and, in particular, consciousness?
<br />
<br />Consider that we have a physical Turing Machine that instantiates the
<br />
phenomenal state of a conscious observer. To do this, it starts with a
<br />
prepared tape and runs through a sequence of state changes, writing symbols
<br />
to the tape, and moving the read-write as it does so. It engages in a lot of
<br />
physical activity. By assumption, the phenomenal state supervenes on this
<br />
physical computational activity. Each time we run the machine we will get
<br />
the same phenomenal state.
<br />
<br />Let's try to minimise the amount of computational activity that the Turing
<br />
Machine must engage in. We note that many possible pathways through the
<br />
machine state table are not used in our particular computation because
<br />
certain counterfactuals are not true. For example, on the first step, the
<br />
machine might actually go from S_0 to S_8 because the data location on the
<br />
tape contained 0. Had the tape contained a 1, it might have gone to S_10,
<br />
but this doesn't obtain because the 1 was not actually present.
<br />
<br />So let's unravel the actual computational path taken by the machine when it
<br />
starts with the prepared tape. Here are the actual machine states and tape
<br />
locations at each step:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S_0   s_8   s_7   s_7   s_3   s_2 . . . s_1023
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t_0   t_1   t_2   t_1   t_2   t_3 . . . t_2032
<br />
<br />Re-label these as follows:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s_[0] s_[1] s_[2] s_[3] s_[4] s_[5] . . .s_[N]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;t_[0] t_[1] t_[2] t_[3] t_[4] t_[5] . . .t_[N]
<br />
<br />Note that t_[1] and t_[3] are the same tape location, namely t_1. Similarly,
<br />
t_[2] and t_[4] are both tape location t_2. These tape locations are
<br />
&quot;multiply-located&quot;.
<br />
<br />The tape locations t_[0], t[1], t[2], ..., can be arranged in physical
<br />
sequence provided that a mechanism is provided to link the multiply-located
<br />
locations. Thus t[1] and t[3] might be joined by a circuit that turns both
<br />
on when a 1 is written and both off when a 0 is written. Now when the
<br />
machine runs, it has to take account of the remapped tape locations when
<br />
computing what state to go into next. Nevertheless, the net-effect of all
<br />
this is that it just runs from left to right. 
<br />
<br />If the machine just runs from left to right, why bother computing the state
<br />
changes? We could just arrange for each tape location to turn on (1 = on) or
<br />
off (0 = off) when the read/write head arrives. For example, if t_[2] would
<br />
have been turned on in the original computation, then there would be a local
<br />
mechanism that turns that location on when the read/write head arrives (note
<br />
that t_[4] would also turn on because it is linked to t_[2]). The state
<br />
S_[i] is then defined to occur when the machine is at tape location t_[i]
<br />
(this machine therefore undergoes as many state changes as the original
<br />
machine). Now we have a machine that just moves from left to right
<br />
triggering tape locations. To make it even simpler, the read/write head can
<br />
be replaced by a armature that moves from left to right triggering tape
<br />
locations. We have a very lazy machine! It's name is Olympia.
<br />
<br />What, then, is the physical activity on which the phenomenal state
<br />
supervenes? It cannot be in the activity of the armature moving from
<br />
left to right. That doesn't seem to have the required complexity. Is it in
<br />
the turning on and off of the tape locations as the armature moves?
<br />
Again that does not seem to have the required degree of complexity.
<br />
<br />It might be objected that in stripping out the computational pathway that we
<br />
did, we have neglected all the other pathways that could have been executed
<br />
but never in fact were. But what difference do these pathways make? We could
<br />
construct similar left-right machines for each of these pathways. These
<br />
machines would be triggered when a counterfactual occurs at a tape location.
<br />
The triggering mechanism is simple. If, say, t_[3] was originally on just
<br />
prior to the arrival of the read/write head but is now in fact off, then we
<br />
can freeze the original machine and arrange for another left-right machine
<br />
to start from that tape location. This triggering and freezing can be done
<br />
using a simple local mechanism at t_[3]. 
<br />
<br />For brevity, I have just sketched how the counterfactuals might be
<br />
implemented (see the original article for more detail). The point is that we
<br />
have implemented all this extra machinery for supporting counterfactuals,
<br />
but none of it is actually used during the original computation. It remains
<br />
silent and inactive. Olympia runs just as well without them. Does connecting
<br />
up all the counterfactual machinery make Olympia phenomenally aware? And
<br />
does disconnecting the machinery make her not phenomenally aware even though
<br />
exactly the same computation is taking place? 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the above, it would seem the following are inconsistent with each
</em><br />
other.
<br />
<br />1. Your phenomenal state at a time is entirely determined by your brain
<br />
activity at the time.
<br />
2. For any phenomenal state of consciousness there exists some program, some
<br />
tape configuration, and some sequence of machine states that brings about
<br />
that phenomenal state on any physical machine capable of running the
<br />
program.
<br />
3. A physical system supports a phenomenal state if that the system can be
<br />
implemented as a Turing Machine performing some computation.
<br />
<br />Maudlin's conclusion is that phenomenal states cannot supervene on physical
<br />
computational activity.
<br />
<br />This, of course, is where Bruno and co. step in.

<br /><br />Notes:
<br />
1. Bruno Marchal independently discovered the movie-graph argument in 1988.
<br />
2. Maudlin considered a machine that used water troughs in place of tape
<br />
locations, but I really didn't want to inflict that kind of imagery on Bill!
