2009/7/31 Rex Allen &lt;rexallen314.domain.name.hidden&gt;:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't see that the electron's experiential aspect contributes in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way to my experience of electrons.  And, in a easier to visualize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; vein, the same goes for chairs.  Maybe there's something that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to be a chair, but this is irrelevant to my conscious experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of chairs.  How could the chair's experience of its existence affect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my experience of the chair?
</em><br />
<br />The relevance of the chair's experience (though unremembered by the
<br />
chair) to your (remembered) conscious experience of the chair is just
<br />
that both awarenesses owe their existence to the same ontological
<br />
facts and events.  Furthermore, it's crucial to see IMO that at the
<br />
fundamental level, this awareness is critical to causal 'closure'.
<br />
Not to put too fine a point on it, what I'm saying is that the
<br />
fundamental relations between explanatory entities must depend on
<br />
perception and intention as well as action.  To speak somewhat
<br />
metaphorically, 'particle-particle' relations must entail that the
<br />
'particles' - however one defines them - in some minimum, but
<br />
irreducible sense, perceive, intend, and act with respect to each
<br />
other.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So in addition to conscious experience being uncaused, I take it to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also be acausal.
</em><br />
<br />Well, uncaused is one thing: you can dig down to the underpinnings
<br />
below the presentation level, IMO, but every regress has to stop
<br />
somewhere, as any schoolchild knows.  And of course the *vocabulary*,
<br />
so to speak, of consciousness - the rawness of the feels - is not
<br />
itself within the domain of explanation.   But acausal, that's a horse
<br />
of a different colour.  Indeed that's what you end up with in the
<br />
current world according to physics (which it's why I say it's
<br />
incomplete).  But if you believe this, you're with Spinoza and Liebniz
<br />
in believing that consciousness just parallels physics without
<br />
interacting with it in any way - and frankly I wouldn't even have a
<br />
clue what this could mean.
<br />
<br />The challenge is I think to see that there must be an evolutionary
<br />
point, in the end, to the effort that has gone into the complex
<br />
machinery of self-awareness we all possess.  There must be some things
<br />
that can only be achieved by taking things personally in that
<br />
particular way that can't be done impersonally - i.e. 'unconsciously'
<br />
by one of Chalmers' Australian zombies.  And for this to be so it must
<br />
supervene on the sort of causal principles I've tried to expose as
<br />
intrinsic to existence in this personal sense.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I take it to be acausal even to the extent that my current subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is not caused by my previous experiences.  Each moment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness stands alone, connected to it's predecessors and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successors only by the similarity of their content.
</em><br />
<br />You may be putting a heavier burden on the sense of 'causal' that it
<br />
needs to carry.  We just need to show - by similarity as you say -
<br />
that your states of consciousness are nomologically linked.  So it's
<br />
really a sort of self-fulfilling principle: you possess just enough
<br />
coherence to claim that your experience is coherent to that degree.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You can find all sorts of causal-structure models, in physics or in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; COMP, that can be fit to the contents of your conscious experience,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but these are just descriptive, not proscriptive.
</em><br />
<br />No, I think when properly conceived they are proscriptive in their own
<br />
terms.  There's no sense of 'necessary' that I'm aware of (with the
<br />
doubtful exception of Bruno's possibly necessary numbers) that can do
<br />
any more work than this.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It does seem likely to me that our conscious experience exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessarily.
</em><br />
<br />It's 'necessity' consists in it's being the defining characteristic of
<br />
existence-for-self.  Given the manifest presence rather than absence
<br />
of such existence, it is clearly necessary.  Nevertheless, in some
<br />
counterfactual sense, it might have been absent and never present.
<br />
But this is possibly excessively Talmudic.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Though for it to be a mystery would imply a hidden,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unknown cause.  But consciousness is uncaused, it just exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (necessarily), so there can be no mystery.
</em><br />
<br />The difference between 'uncaused' and 'mysterious' is somewhat elusive, perhaps.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So my point is simply: let's start from the understanding that to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exist is just and only what it is to exist-for-oneself: the defining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; characteristic of existence is 'taking everything personally'.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; standard put-down at this point is something like 'well how personally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; do you suppose an electron takes itself?' to which the riposte is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; simply 'precisely as personally as it needs to exist'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So I'm willing to believe that there might be &quot;something that it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like&quot; to be an electron, that electrons may in some way have some sort
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of subjective experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; BUT, as you say, that all happens in a different part of the forest.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Conscious experience only does one thing:  exist.  Consciousness just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is.  There's nothing else to it.  No other purpose for it.  No deeper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning in it.  No additional role that it plays in some larger

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; As to 'first' causes, I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; we've reached the end of the semantic road.  If you want, you can can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; elect to be a mathematical Prospero and conjure us from the deep by

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tautological force majeure, or you can accept the mystery of our
