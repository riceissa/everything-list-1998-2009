<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; It has often been pointed out on this list that universes are those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; parts of the multiverse down which information flows. So Harry
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;&gt; Potter &quot;universes&quot; are not in fact universes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What do you mean by &quot;parts of the multiverse down which information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; flows&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, let's start with information. I have in mind David's qualitative
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0104033">http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/quant-ph/0104033</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To quote:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1. A physical system S *contains information* about a parameter b if …
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the probability of some outcome of some measurement on S depends on b.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2. A physical system S *contains no information* about b if … there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists a complete description of S that is independent on b.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is meant by information flow is explained here:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Fabric-of-Reality/message/9247">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Fabric-of-Reality/message/9247</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Basically, information flows when the output depends in some way on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the input.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As David has shown, the structure of the multiverse is determined by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information flow. A universe is a part of the multiverse where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information flows freely.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />OK. I guess you know that this is not a standard use of the term 
<br />
&quot;information&quot;, like the one of Shannon, where the bits measure some 
<br />
degree of surprise and unpredictibility (and this can been make precise 
<br />
with notion of Kolmogorov/Chaitin/Solovay notion of information).
<br />
David Deutsch's notion of information can be related to some logician's 
<br />
attempt to define a sort of qualitative information, and as such it is 
<br />
quite interesting, but also natural, to find it in an attempt to 
<br />
retrieve classical computational histories from the quantum theory.
<br />
Now you should keep in mind that David does postulate the existence of 
<br />
some continuum causal structure, and, as you know, I am doubtful this 
<br />
can make sense once we accept the computationalist hypothesis (cf 
<br />
Maudlin's Olympia, my work, etc.). Actually I think David Hume makes 
<br />
already important steps in that direction.
<br />
Just to illustrate: imagine the case of iterated self-duplication with 
<br />
reconstitutions in Sidney and Beijing: S and B. From the point of view 
<br />
of the &quot;average candidate&quot; normal histories, in the form of sequences 
<br />
of P and S,  will be highly unpredictable, but in all case there will 
<br />
be no causal relations between the events &quot;I feel myself to be in S&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;I feel myself to be in P&quot;.
<br />
Exceptional histories, like the one in which the sequence gives the 
<br />
binary digits of the number PI, play the role, curiously enough, of the 
<br />
Harry Potter histories, in that case.
<br />
So the two notion of information are quite complementary. It is almost 
<br />
like one grows up when the other diminishes.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Harry Potter universes are just improbable, and information grows to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; much there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Things spontaneously organise themselves in an HPU, but the output
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does not depend on the input; there is no information flow in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense described above.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />So I agree. And of course I was considering a Shannon form of 
<br />
information.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; When Harry Potter does a trick, in almost all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes the trick does not work. But one cannot say the trick
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succeeded in those universes that do become HPU's because one can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single out beforehand those exceptionally rare universes that will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; become HPU's.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I agree.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It is almost like they got singularities in the amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; information. But death, well, really it is an open problem, because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you must take into account the normal (statistical, based on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; measure on the &quot;observer/moment/states/worlds...&quot;) possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; histories just going locally through exceptional states,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Meaningful histories must have a flow of information right?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I don't think so. I would say that meaningful histories are the 
<br />
relatively consistent (non contradictory) one---which will get some 
<br />
right measure assuming comp, and the correctness of my derivation, to 
<br />
be sure. Those meaningful histories will appear, from the observer 
<br />
first person point of view be related to some local flux of information 
<br />
in David's sense. But I don't know how to take for granted those 
<br />
meaningful histories at the start (unless, like David, you already 
<br />
postulate some &quot;prior programs&quot; as an explanation of the appearance of 
<br />
the universe. But then again you will be confronted with the comp 
<br />
version of the Mind/Body, or 1-person/3-person relations again.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories, the Universal Dovetailer has outputted a series of random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers that just happen to be indistinguishable from your life
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; history up to today. In these histories, your past state does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determine your present state (although they are in every way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indistinguishable from histories where your past state really does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; determine your present state).
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I would say you belong to all histories. But with comp you are so 
<br />
constituted that only the consistent one will make sense and will be 
<br />
stable enough.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Almost all of these histories will turn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to junk at the very next moment. But some won't.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Yes but here you touch the real difficulty which could one day kill the 
<br />
comp hyp. The difficulty is that &quot;junk&quot; can be consistent. Harry Potter 
<br />
universe are consistent. White Rabbits are consistent.  We can only 
<br />
thrown them away once we have shown they have low relative measure. 
<br />
Deutsch's justification is correct but incomplete, I think. It is 
<br />
complete only by postulating the existence of a causal realm, or of a 
<br />
special prior universal program a-la-Schmidhuber. I have already 
<br />
criticize such move once we assume comp keeping in mind the distinction 
<br />
between the points of view.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Let's suppose that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; huge meteorite is about to crash into your house.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Let us suppose .... (thanks!!!)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In most histories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you will be dead and vapourised.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Just to be clear, you and all other people (other than me) will seen me 
<br />
dead (and vaporized if you insist ;).
<br />
I will most probably not feel myself dead or vaporized (obvious with 
<br />
comp).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in some of the random histories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that give the illusion of order and information flow you survive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because the next state just happens to correspond to you sitting alive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - looking very black and charred - in a giant crater.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Can you really be said to be alive post-impact if these random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; histories are all that is left?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess you will answer that there will still be histories post-impact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where your next state really does depend on your previous state even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if those histories were random (in just the right way) during impact.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Correctomundo?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Quite correct. Why do you ask if you know the answer? You see, a 
<br />
machine cannot distinguish random stories (Shannon information high, 
<br />
Deutsch information low) from complex stories (Shannon information low 
<br />
or much less high, and Deutsch information high). In the normal 
<br />
situations, we can indeed survive only in those where Deutsch 
<br />
information is high, but &quot;near death&quot; we will survive in the &quot;most&quot; 
<br />
normal relatively to the normal histories which gave rise to us, and 
<br />
immediately &quot;after&quot; we will proceed in those new relatively normal 
<br />
extensions.
<br />
Deutsch paper is very interesting and I agree with many things there, 
<br />
but I would not take notion like continuum and causality as granted. I 
<br />
would say those things, like the &quot;collapse of the wave&quot;,  emerges from 
<br />
the relatively consistent observations available to us.
<br />
<br />In &quot;the structure of the multiverse&quot; deutsch write:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;This does not imply that such a subsystem constitutes half the region 
<br />
of the multiverse in which R exists. Proportions in the latter sense – 
<br />
which formally play the role of probabilities under some circumstances, 
<br />
as shown in Deutsch (1999) – are determined by the Heisenberg state as 
<br />
well as the observables, and do not concern us here because the present 
<br />
discussion is not quantitative.&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />My general problem here would be to find a way to relate more clearly   
<br />
the quantitative shannon form of information and  its probability link, 
<br />
with the Deutsch information notion.
<br />
Some logician like Abramsky (is he in Oxford?) seems to have make 
<br />
attempts in similar direction. Keith Devlin wrote also a book on 
<br />
&quot;non-shannon&quot; like information.
<br />
<br />Another direction would consist in deepening the interview with the 
<br />
universal (lobian) machine. Each theaetical knowledge notion should 
<br />
lead to an information structure. I cannot explain this without digging 
<br />
more on the modal logic of self-reference, and the theaetical 
<br />
transformations. So ask me on the everything list if you want me to 
<br />
make clearer that last paragraph. It could interest also the FOR 
<br />
people, because I do think that the difference between &quot;p &amp; 
<br />
provable(p)&quot; with &quot;consistent(p) &amp; provable(p)&quot; is akin to the 
<br />
&quot;correction&quot;, proposed by Popper/Deutsch and Rafe Champion here,  of  
<br />
the platonist &quot;true opinion&quot; notion of knowledge (= first theatetical 
<br />
trick) which leads to a more conjectural from of knowledge. By 
<br />
incompleteness &quot;consistent(p)&quot; is necessarily conjectural.
<br />
<br />...must go now. Hope I'm clear enough.
