<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Russell,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thanks for your answers.  I think my description and understanding of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Doomsday argument was overly simplified, but there is a very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar anthropic reasoning problem I heard before.  The situation is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are 5,000 females and 5 males that are created as part of some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment.  They are the only humans that exist at the time.  200
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years later after all the humans in the study have died the alien
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experimenter creates 5 females and 5,000 males.  Now if you are in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this experiment and find yourself to be male, you could reasonably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guess that you are part of the second batch of humans, since 99.9% of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; males in the experiments belong to the second batch.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The original 5 males short of being given extra information will also
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conclude they are part of the second group.  What would they conclude,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however, if they were told they are part of the first batch?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally I would conclude, &quot;Well it had to be someone, there was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after all, an original group.  I just happen to be one of those few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rare ones.&quot; 
</em><br />
<br />That you are even in such an experiment at all is a rare situation,
<br />
and a cause to look for explanations elsewhere.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; ASSA looks for explanations elsewhere, such as concluding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that perhaps the aliens likely never go through with the second half
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the experiment in the future, or maybe the aliens mess up the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creation of the humans and create non-conscious zombie males.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; danger I see in using SSAs to determine what animals can be conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is that inevitably there are human generated OMs, regardless of there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being ant OMs or not.  We may be extremely rare in the set of all OMs,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I don't see the probability that my OM is experienced as some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value between 0 and 1, I see it as 1.  This I think is the root of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; difference in conclusions between you and I.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />I don't think thought experiments work. We cannot arbitrarily define
<br />
the reference class like you did above. Sorry, but I don't find this
<br />
line of argument convincing.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regarding the mirror test, I see two problems with it.  The first is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is some bias to it, it is biased towards animals that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; visually orientated.  Dogs for example, do not pass.  However can a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dog recognize its own scent?  I believe they can, they can follow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their own tracks.  If Dogs ruled the world and subjected humans to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-smell test would humans be capable of passing?  Would it be valid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the dogs to conclude humans weren't conscious because they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; couldn't identify themselves by their scent?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Absolutely agree. I comment on this very thing on page 95 of my book.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My second objection is that I don't think self-awareness is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary requirement for consciousness.  I equate awareness with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness.  One could be aware of many things without being aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the self.  The phenomenon of &quot;ego death&quot; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a case when humans can lose the sense of self, yet they don't lose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness in the process.  
</em><br />
<br />As I have said before, it is only a requirement that one be capable of
<br />
self-awareness in order to be capable of consciousness, (this comes
<br />
from the anthropic principle reasoning) not that self-awareness is
<br />
required every waking moment. Nevertheless, it is still of passing
<br />
interest to see what people who've experienced this phenomenon
<br />
actually report of their consciousness, just as it is interesting to
<br />
see what people report of their experiences of sensory deprivation.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think there is some process in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain that generates the sensation of the self being a distinct actor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within an environment but I think this is just a tool that evolution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Sure.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; My view on consciousness is similar to Chalmer's, in that perhaps all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; informational processes might be conscious in some manner:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/254?in=00:22:04&amp;out=00:30:01">http://bloggingheads.tv/diavlogs/254?in=00:22:04&amp;out=00:30:01</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chalmers also mentions the more conservative view that only certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; types of informational processes are conscious. 
</em><br />
<br />An informational process is just a physical process that is
<br />
interpreted in a symbolic way by some observer. Consciousness must be
<br />
an objective property of a process. In order to be restrict
<br />
consciousness to just information processes independent of all other
<br />
observers, it has to  self-interpret symbollically, ie be
<br />
self-aware.
<br />
<br />Of course informational processes need not be self-aware, but in that
<br />
case they are information only by virtue of being so interpreted by
<br />
another conscious entity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Perhaps some type of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-reference is required, but I am not yet convinced.  I have Godel,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Escher, Bach on my reading queue and may change my opinion after
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading it, as my understanding of it is that it says consciousness is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the result of &quot;strange loops&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<br />Hofstadter has some extremely interesting speculations along these
<br />
lines, and GEB is a very entertaining read, however you won't find the
<br />
idea of strange loops well developed in that book. You would probably
<br />
learn more from the Wikipedia page. Apparently, he has written a more
<br />
recent book on the topic, or you could try Ian Stewart and Jack
<br />
Cohen's &quot;Figment of Reality&quot;.
<br />
<br />Incidently, strange loops are a recurring theme in my Theory of Nothing
