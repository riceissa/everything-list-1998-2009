Gilles H:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In fact there is no precise definition of what is a macroscopic world in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;MWI. This is one of the major difficulties of the theory; however it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical to consider that two different macroscopic worlds have by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definition negligible interference terms, which makes the conventional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interpretation of QM  work (reduction of the wave packet). Interference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;terms are important only at the microscopic level.[...]
</em><br />
<br />Bruno M:
<br />
OK, but MWI has been invented so that there is no need to distinguish macroscopic from microscopic. This is made still clearer in the decoherence approach.
<br />
The term world is also ambiguous. In the MWI if I measure the spin
<br />
of an electron which is in a superposition of spin states, I will just put
<br />
myself in a macroscopic superposition states, and Everett (+ Hartle, Omnes, etc.) provides a phenomenological explanation why it is difficult to exploit macroscopic interference. But it is really not the MACRO/MICRO distinction which play a role here: it is much more the ISOLATE or CLOSED versus OPEN which makes the difference. Isn't it ?
<br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Remember that with comp we are by definition informatical (in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;classical sense) entity, and we are (from a third person point of view)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;100% exactly duplicable. (In the same sense that you can make *in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;principle* a perfect copy of the 10E100 first decimal of PI).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; GH:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;...but not of PI in a finite time. Of course as we already discussed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe could be discrete. But you cannot make an  exact copy of it at its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finest level (ie Planck scale) with a machine embedded in it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The point is that when you say &quot;we are informatical&quot;, you probably mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that, like a computer, our computational structure can be described with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much less information than our physical one. That's why we can built
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perfectly reproducible computers, and we can duplicate them with very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different physical structures.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
That is indeed the point. By the comp hypothesis I mean  there is a level
<br />
of description such that I survive duplication at that level. I don't know
<br />
if comp is true. It is my working hypothesis. What I try to show is that 
<br />
if comp is correct then, independently of the correctness of QM, we get an
<br />
&quot;everything phenomenology (which could very well include &quot;continuous observable&quot; as I was tentatively explaining to Juergen in some post).
<br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But it can well be (and it is very probable) that the brain is not like our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simple computers...
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I agree with &quot;it can well be&quot;. I don't think it is very probable.
<br />
I mean I don't see why you think it is very probable. The brain is a very hot and stable physical system.
<br />
But honestly I don't care. If comp is true, it is a theorem that comp 
<br />
CAN be consistently asserted false.
<br />
I would care if you give me a kind of definite argument that the brain is in some relevant way a continuous non digitalisable object. In that case comp would be proved to be false. If you do that I will believe in physics and abandon the comp approach to the mind-body problem. But today I don't see the slightest evidence in that direction. I take QM as a very strong experimental confirmation of the immaterialist comp hypothesis(°).
<br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And in fact the brain is no more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;informatical in the first sense, because it may well be that you need the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complete description of its physical state. So unlike our artificial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computers, its evolution is NOT simpler than the evolution of any physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system. And if you have to go to the quantum level ,(even worse, to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Planck scale!) you are facing a practical impossibility: it is (even in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;principle) impossible to measure the complete quantum state of a single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system, and a fortiori to reproduce it (just because the complex value
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Psi(x,t) can not be an observable). And as we already discussed you will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lead to simulate the whole environment (ie visible Universe) at this level,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which is also impossible...
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I am sure you are consistent here, and it could be you are correct too,
<br />
at least in your conclusion. But the fact that the complete state Psi(x,t)
<br />
is not  reproducible or measurable is not relevant. The UD* platonistically reproduce it at all digitalisable level by definition; and I have given reason to think that that is enough to explain how the everything feature emerge.
<br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As you well know, it is impossible to prepare a macroscopic system in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coherent superposition because of the environment induced decoherence. So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your joke experiment is really impossible (the scientist is either mad or a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lier!).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What is possible of course, and very simple, is to prepare you in some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1/sqrt(|a_1|^2 + |a_2|^2)°*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [a_1*|you in-hell&gt;|world with you in-hell&gt; + a_2*|you in-paradise&gt;|world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with you in-paradise&gt;]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simply by measuring the spin of a polarized electron on a conveniently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chosen axis (with relative probability a1/a2) and decide to send you in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hell or paradize following the result. Of course as your states are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;incoherent you are back to simple probability calculus and the choice is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obvious.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
OK. But what is your point here ? Globally, we still have a multiplication of our state whith copy of me in hell and copies of me in paradise, in some proportion.
<br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What I meant is that if you think you die, your selfishness is useless. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;only need a minimal amount of altruism to choose B. If you are a pure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;selfish man, you won't care about your choice.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I don't understand. If I choose A, I expect myself to go in Hell with 
<br />
high probability. Why shouldn't my &quot;selfish ego&quot; care ?
<br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ok, Bruno may be you would choose B. What about if, despite my promises,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you are not completely confident in my capability of creating the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;999999 copies? (I assume of course that once in the box, you are totally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unaware of what happens really in the other boxes. As is well known, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will forget everything in paradise!)
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
You are changing the hypothesis of the thought experiment. I suppose here that you are capable of generating the 999999 exact copies.
<br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;May be this thought experiment is a proof that COMP (understood as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility of creating an EXACT copy of yourself) is false?
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I have already answer that. The thought experiment shows only that comp is unprovable and unbelievable (this aspect of the thought experiment can be
<br />
described with modal axiomatisation of belief,with some reasonable sense of &quot;believable&quot;: ...).
<br />
You only succeed in convincing me that you don't find comp believable.
<br />
But I tell you: no consistent machine can be sure of the correctness of comp. Some machine can bet on it. And my purpose is to explain to &quot;these machines&quot; that if they bet on comp, they must explain the deterministic and local feature of our neighborhood from the high mechanist (UD*-like) 
<br />
indeterminism and non locality. And that would provide an explanation of the lawfullness of our experiences.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Bruno.
<br />
<br />(°) To be sure I take the &quot;Q&quot; of QM as an experimental confirmation (not proof!) of comp. To be honest, the &quot;M&quot; of QM remains a rather big mystery.
<br />
For a mechanist, the &quot;mechanical action&quot; remains a rather curious think.
<br />
With comp the weird aspect of QM appears natural, the non-weird aspect of QM becomes weird!
<br />
I am not sure Wei Dai or Schmidhuber &quot;little-program&quot; explanation is enough
<br />
here.
<br />
I have some hope that Roy Frieden's work will help. But I am afraid that Frieden take &quot;space&quot; and &quot;time&quot; (or space-time) for granted.
