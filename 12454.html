Brent: 'However, all that is needed for the arguments that appear on 
<br />
this list is to recreate a rough, functioning copy of the body plus a 
<br />
detailed reproduction of memory and a brain that functioned 
<br />
approximately the same.  That much might not be too hard.  After all, as 
<br />
Stathis points out, you're not the same atoms you were a week ago'
<br />
<br />MP: Well! I'm not going to let YOU pull the levers or press any buttons 
<br />
if I have to be faxed anywhere soon! You make  philosophers' 
<br />
copy-machines sound like props for Frankenstein's  Monster or that movie 
<br />
'The Fly'. Furthermore &quot; ... memory and a brain that functioned 
<br />
approximately the same&quot; would seem to be rather less than what Bruno's 
<br />
arguments about copying require. But my point is that, whilst the ideas 
<br />
are cute, they are also nonsense any way. Most people have problems 
<br />
enough living from day to day, and the only time that 'copying' of a 
<br />
person really has any relevance is where surgery or prosthetic 
<br />
augmentation of some kind really should be done to alleviate suffering 
<br />
or prevent premature death.
<br />
<br />As for Stathis's assertion about seemingly minor changes which commonly 
<br />
occur to people's brains as they get older, like the odd little stroke 
<br />
here and there, it is always a question of the facts in each case. Some 
<br />
deficiencies turn out to be crucial in terms of quality of life: loosing 
<br />
the use of one or two fingers could be annoying, embarrassing and on 
<br />
occasion quite dangerous. Losing the ability to remember the names of 
<br />
all the people you know, would likewise not be nice. On the other hand, 
<br />
losing the ability to recognise things on the left side of your world, 
<br />
or losing the ability to see the people you knew before as being THOSE 
<br />
people such that you become convinced that the person you are with is a 
<br />
substitute, now that could be very dysfunctional and very distressing. I 
<br />
have seen it written that in fact most people who survive past middle 
<br />
age, do in fact suffer from 'micro' strokes quite often but usually the 
<br />
perceived experience is that of progressively weakened memory. Not 
<br />
Alzheimer's which is a league of its own, but just difficulty 
<br />
remembering certain things.
<br />
<br />I am just about to post another message which might stir some angst [or 
<br />
not in which case 'ho hum'], so I leave this here.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP:  :-) Yes, this much is easy to infer. The full scope of what this

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: Infinity, infinite, infinitely big or small; these are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; challenging concepts at the best of times and made very interesting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to the point of mind-boggling in the contexts of QM and relativity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; theory. In QM, there is apparently NOT an infinitely small level of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; existence that could be reached by any kind of measurement due to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; shortest length and shortest durations denoted by the Planck length 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; and Planck time. I personally wonder whether there is room to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; criticise this limitation. The underlying concept of Process Physics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [let me call that PP from now on] directly challenges the idea.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; MP: My point about measurement is to do with the fact that in seeking 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to get as exact a copy as possible, not just a working model, it is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; possible that the digital representations of salient features might 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; need more decimal places than the recording and/or transmission 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; systems can provide. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Lawrence Krauss wrote a book called &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot; in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which he discusses the &quot;transporter&quot; on the Enterprise.  He calculates 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that to measure the location of the atoms in a human body in order to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recreate it (as in 'Bean me up Scotty') would take an enormous amount 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of energy - something like converting the mass of the Earth to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; energy.  However, all that is needed for the arguments that appear on

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this list is to recreate a rough, functioning copy of the body plus a
