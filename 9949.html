<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I mean that is what material exists regardless of any mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; justification.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So this is your main hypothesis: what is material exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now my problem is that a term like &quot;material&quot; is very vague in physics,
</em><br />
<br />Huh ? Physics studies matter, energy, time and space. Those
<br />
are its topics. Physics may not have a single neat definition of
<br />
matter, but
<br />
that does not mean physicsts are a lot to know what it is.
<br />
Arguably, the whole of economics is a definition of &quot;money&quot;,
<br />
Likewise for physics and matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and  I would say experimentally vague since the birth of experimental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantum philosophy (EPR, Bell, Shimoni, Feynman, Deutsch, Bennett ...).
</em><br />
<br />Huh???? Electrons and photons are still matter...what *do* you mean ?
<br />
<br />(BTW, Deutsch uses the Johnsonian &quot;if it kicks back&quot; appraoch
<br />
to reality).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The big problem with the notion of *primary* matter =  how to relate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;1-experiences&quot; with &quot;3-experiments&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />The mind-body prolbem boild down to qualia, and
<br />
the problem of qualia and physics boils down to
<br />
the problem of qualia and mathematical description
<br />
<br /><br />Consciousness is a problem for all forms of materialism and physicalism
<br />
to some
<br />
extent, but it is possible to discern where the problem is particularly
<br />
acute.
<br />
There is no great problem with the idea that matter considered as a
<br />
bare substrate can
<br />
have mental properities. Any inability to have mental proeprties would
<br />
itslef be a property and
<br />
therefore be inconsistent with the bareness of a bare substrate. The
<br />
&quot;subjectity&quot; of
<br />
consciouss states, often treated as &quot;inherent&quot; boils down to a problem
<br />
of communicating
<br />
one's qualia -- how one feesl, how things seem. Thus it is not truly
<br />
inherent but
<br />
depends on the means of communication being used. Feelings and seemings
<br />
can be more readily
<br />
communicated in artistic, poetice language, and least readily in
<br />
scientifi technical
<br />
language. Since the harder, more technical a science is, the more
<br />
mathematical it is,
<br />
the communication problem is at its most acute in a purely mathematical
<br />
langauge.
<br />
Thus the problem with physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare
<br />
substrate)
<br />
but its other posit, that all properties are phycial. Since physics is
<br />
mathematical,
<br />
that amounts to the claim that all properties are mathematical (or at
<br />
least mathematically
<br />
describable). In making the transition from a physicalist world-view to
<br />
a mathematical
<br />
one, the concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was
<br />
never a problem
<br />
for consciousness) and the posit of mathematical properties becomes,
<br />
which is a problem
<br />
for consciousness becomes extreme.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The naïve idea of attaching consciousness to physical activity leads to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fatal difficulties.
</em><br />
<br />Do you mean the Maudlin/Olympia/Movie argument ? But that is
<br />
very much phsyical activity as opposed to physical passivity.
<br />
If you are the kind of physicalist who thinks
<br />
counterfactuals and potentials are part of the total
<br />
physical situation, the Maudlin argument has little
<br />
impact.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Well, why not, if that is your definition. I understand better why you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; say you could introduce &quot;matter&quot; in Platonia. Plato would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; disagree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; in the sense that &quot;matter&quot; is the shadow of the ideal intelligible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What is material exists. Whether Platonia exists
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is another matter. It is for Platonism to justify itslef
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in terms of the concrete reality we find oursleves in,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not for concrete reality to be justify itself in terms
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It depends of the assumptions you start from.
</em><br />
<br />Of course. I start from the assumption
<br />
that I exist, since I do.
<br />
<br />I don't start from the assumtion that numbers
<br />
exist supernaturally , floating around in Plato's
<br />
heaven.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The &quot;intelligible&quot; is a quasi-empiricist mathematical epistemology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Mathematicians are supposed by Platonists to be able to &quot;perceive&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; truth with some extra organ.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is naïve platonism. Already condemned by Plato himself and most of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; his followers. Read Plotinus for more on this (especially Ennead V).
</em><br />
<br /><br />The question then is whether numbers have any role at all,
<br />
if they have no epistemological role.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; I don't understand what you mean by &quot;numbers don't exist at all&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, I've never seen one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again that would be a critics of naïve Platonism. As I have said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;number n exists in Platonia&quot; means just that the proposition &quot;number n
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists&quot; is true. For example I believe that the equation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; x^2 - 61y^2 = 1 admits integers solutions independently of any things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related to me.
</em><br />
<br />If that is all it means, it cannot possibly support an argument
<br />
whose conclusion is that something really exists.
<br />
<br />The conclusion of a deductive argument has to be implicit in its
<br />
premisses.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Numbers exists in Platonia in the sense that the classical proposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;4356667654090987890111 is prime or 4356667654090987890111 is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; prime&quot; is true there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It's true here. why bring Platonia into it ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't understand what you mean by &quot;4356667654090987890111 is prime or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not&quot; is true here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it false or meaningless on the moon?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is it false or meaningless beyond the solar system?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is it false or meaningless beyond the Milky Way?
</em><br />
<br />It's true here, in the non-Platonic world.
<br />
<br />We don't need the Platonic World to *make* it true. It fulfils
<br />
no epistemological role.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; they they cannot even produce the mere appearance of a physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; world,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; as Bruno requires.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What doesn't exist at all cannot underpin the existence of anything --
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; even of an illusion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do agree with you. But, once we assume comp, we can attach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness to sheaf of computational histories (abstract
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations which can be defined precisely from the Fi and the Wi:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more in the diagonalization posts).
</em><br />
<br />Of course, *standard* computationalism doesn't by itself allow
<br />
you to attach cognition/consciousness to anything abstract.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those computations are entirely defined by infinite sets of true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relations among numbers. You could perhaps wait I define the &quot;Kleene
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predicate&quot; in the diagonalization posts. or read the beautiful work of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Matiazevitch on the diophantine equations. A set of numbers is RE, i.e.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a Wi set, if and only if it is given by the zero of a diophantine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; polynomial.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I dare say *algorithms* can be defined Platonically.
<br />
Computations can be multiply replicated at different points
<br />
in space and time (or not at all) so they are not Platonic.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In *all* situation, when I say a number exists, or when I say a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sequence of numbers exists, I only mean that the proposition expressing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that existence is true independently of me or you.
</em><br />
<br />Then nothing actually existing can possible &quot;emerge&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; With Church thesis all computations, as defined in computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; science (not in physics), exists in Platonia, exactly in the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; that for the prime numbers above.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; That is a most unhelpful remark. All you said above is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that true mathematical sentences have truth-values
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; independent of you. You have now started treating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that as a claim about existence. It is as if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; your are using &quot;is true&quot; and &quot;exists&quot; as synonyms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You did not read carefully what I have said. I am just using &quot;exists&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as a quantifier (in first or second order logic). Exists n P(n) = truth
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of &quot;exists n P(n)&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />Which still isn't helpful, since different
<br />
schools of mathematical philosophy put different
<br />
interpretations on the mathematical sense of &quot;exists&quot;.
<br />
<br />Some take it to mean &quot;can be defined wtihout contraciction&quot;,
<br />
some &quot;can be finitely constructed&quot; and so on.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe that there is an infinity of twin primes ... or not,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; independently of the fact that mathematicians on this planet or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elsewhere will solve, or not, that (currently open) problem.
</em><br />
<br />The point remains that existence cannot emerge
<br />
out of truth.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; This would explain not only the existence of computations with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; self-aware observers, but also they relative stability.-AT_SYMBOL-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; But MUCH more can be said, from Solovay theorem (justifying the modal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; logics G and G* for the provable and non provable by a machine/entity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; self-referential truth) I get not only an arithmetical quantization
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; justifying the quanta, I get a larger theory divided into sharable and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; non sharable measurement results. This means I get one mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; structure explaining not only the appearance of a physical world (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; quanta),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You have to explain how a mathematical structure can appear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at all, before you can explain how it can appear quantal (or whatever).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Honestly why?
</em><br />
<br />Logic. Something has to exist before it has any particular properties.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I presuppose some amount of arithmetic.
</em><br />
<br />Presume its existence or just its truth ?
<br />
Back to the usual ambiguity.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arithmetical  platonist I suppose those existential proposition are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true. Comma. I don't believe math truth are related to time or space.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The number 2, or any math structure, does not *appear*.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Then nothing can appear *from* it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The problem is the slide from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;mathematical statements are objectivley true&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;mathematical objects exist Platonically&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;mathematical objects are capable of having experiences (however
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; illusory)&quot;/
</em><br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK. I hope that what I say above has solved that problem. I recall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again. Note that I don't even pretend that mathematical statements are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objectively true (I am quite neutral about this). I say only this:
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Arithmetical statements are objectively true.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have never slipped into:
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical objects (numbers) exist Platonically&quot; EXCEPT in the sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that some existential arithmetical proposition is objectively true.
</em><br />
<br />And that *does* entail existence ?
<br />
<br />In any case, you do switch between epistemology (realism-qua-truth) and
<br />
&nbsp;ontology (realism-qua-existence), as these quotes  from
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf">http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/~marchal/publications/SANE2004MARCHAL.pdf</a>
<br />
show:
<br />
<br /><br />BM: 'Arithmetical Realism (AR). This is the assumption that
<br />
arithmetical proposition, like
<br />
''1+1=2,'' or Goldbach conjecture, or the inexistence of a
<br />
bigger prime, or the statement
<br />
that some digital machine will stop, or any Boolean formula bearing on
<br />
numbers, are
<br />
true independently of me, you, humanity, the physical universe (if that
<br />
exists), etc. '
<br />
<br />PJ: That's an epistemological claim then....
<br />
<br />BM: 'It is
<br />
a version of Platonism limited at least to arithmetical truth'.
<br />
<br />PJ: Is it ? But Platonism is an ontological thesis. As a standard
<br />
reference work has it: &quot;The philosophy of Plato, or an
<br />
approach to philosophy resembling his. For  example, someone who
<br />
asserts that numbers exist  independently of the
<br />
things they number could be called a Platonist.&quot;
<br />
<br />BM: 'It should not be confused
<br />
with the much stronger Pythagorean form of AR, AR+, which asserts that
<br />
only natural
<br />
numbers exist together with their nameable relations: all the rest
<br />
being derivative from
<br />
those relations.
<br />
<br />If Pythagoreanism is stronger than Platonism in insisting that
<br />
everything is
<br />
derivable from (existing) natural numbers, is Platonism weaker than
<br />
Pythagoreanism
<br />
in insisting that everything is derivable from existing numbers of all
<br />
kinds,
<br />
natural or not? Is Platonism not being taken as a claim about existence
<br />
here, not just a claim about truth ?
<br />
<br />BM: &quot;A machine will be
<br />
said an Arithmetical Platonist if the machine believes enough
<br />
elementary
<br />
arithmetical truth (including some scheme of induction axiom).&quot;
<br />
<br />PJ: Switching back to an epistemological definition of &quot;platonism&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />BM:'Instead of linking [the pain I feel] at space-time (x,t) to
<br />
[a machine state] at space-time
<br />
(x,t), we are obliged to associate [the pain I feel at space-time
<br />
(x,t)]
<br />
to a type or a sheaf of
<br />
computations (existing forever in the arithmetical Platonia which is
<br />
accepted as existing
<br />
independently of our selves with arithmetical realism).'
<br />
<br />PJ: Another use of Realism as a thesis about existence.
<br />
<br />PJ: And if the pain-feeling &quot;you&quot; exists eternally, how do
<br />
ever *not* feel pain ? There is an ontological gulf
<br />
between tokens and types, between the temporal
<br />
and the eternal, which has been leaped over  at a bound here.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I don't believe that mathematical objects, or even *any* 3-object,

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are capable of having experiences (which by definition are *never*

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; illusory).
</em><br />
<br />In which case it is hard to see how your argument could work at all.

<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only subject or person can have experiences, and subject and persons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerges from infinities of (sigma_1) relation between numbers.
</em><br />
<br />What can &quot;emerge&quot; from relationships between mathematical
<br />
structures except more mathematical structures ?
<br />
<br />&quot;And then a miracle occurs&quot;
<br />

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The UD
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generates those relations and assigns some weight to all of them.
</em><br />
<br />&quot;Weight&quot; of course being just another number -- not actual
<br />
existence.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is &quot;computationalism&quot; as understood in philosophy and cognitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; science, yes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am using computationalism in the standard sense, except that I make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it more precise than usual, given that I extract counter-intuitive (for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aristotelians) results from it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I just show that comp, even taken at first with his materialist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; background assumption, leads to the falsity of &quot;weak materialism&quot;:
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me that materialism can survive the Maudlin/Olympia
<br />
argument
<br />
with only a slight adjustment; phenomenal states supervene
<br />
on the total physical state, not just on the active physical state.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idea that there is something genuinely stuffy at the origin of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computations. Comp entails that the appearance of that genuine stuff
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emerges from the independent truth of some formula in arithmetic. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could even put them in polynomial form.
</em><br />
<br />You have a mathematical proof that phenomenality emerges from
<br />
mathematics ??? (And that's *phenomenality*, not uncertainty
<br />
or undecidability).
