</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually this is the whole subject of my thesis. Let me try to explain
<br />
briefly without technics. Let us suppose there is a physical universe.
<br />
Let us suppose &quot;we are living in a massive computer&quot; belonging to
<br />
that universe.
<br />
This means comp is actually true, that is: there is a level of description
<br />
of ourselves such that we could survive any functional substitution
<br />
made at that level. I guess you will agree with the following propositions:
<br />
<br />1) If the clock of that massive computer slows down, we cannot, from
<br />
our first person perspective, be aware of that slowing down. In case
<br />
the computer stops for one year, and then proceeds again, we cannot
<br />
be aware of that stopping. OK?
<br />
<br />2) If a description of the computer is made, at some stage, and then
<br />
destroyed by &quot;real inhabitants&quot; of that universe, and then build again
<br />
again we will not be aware of that destruction reconstruction. OK?
<br />
<br />3) Suppose now that the computer is again &quot;read&quot; and destroyed, and
<br />
then build, but now in two different places of the &quot;universe&quot;, and in two
<br />
slightly different states. I mean the inhabitant of the universe programs
<br />
the computers in such a way that in the simulation 1 some event A will
<br />
take place, and in the simulation 2 some event B (different from A)
<br />
will take place. Then in case the simulated person would be aware of
<br />
this (because the inhabitants of the universe would have tell us the truth,
<br />
we would know that we are completely ignorant about which events A or
<br />
B will take place. This is the first person indeterminacy.
<br />
<br />4) This remains true even if the first copy is run quasi-immediately, and
<br />
the second copy of the massive computer is run after a long delay,
<br />
because the simulated people cannot be aware of any imposed &quot;external
<br />
delay&quot; OK?
<br />
<br />5) As a particular case, we can consider that the inhabitants just make
<br />
a copy of the computer (in which A will be realized), and build from that
<br />
copy a version of the computer in which B be realized. Again the
<br />
first person probability of A and B remains the same (consider that the
<br />
first computer has been destroyed and reconstituted with a null delay, so
<br />
that this is a particular case of the preceding step).OK?
<br />
<br />6) This shows that if we are in a massive computer running in a
<br />
universe,  then (supposing we know it or believe it) to predict the future
<br />
of any experiment we decide to carry one (for example testing A or B)
<br />
we need to take into account all reconstitutions at any time of the
<br />
computer (in the relevant state) in that universe, and actually also
<br />
in any other universes (from our first person perspective we could
<br />
not be aware of the difference of universes from inside the computer).
<br />
<br />7) Here is an admittedly more difficult point: from the first person
<br />
point of view the simulated people in the computer cannot make
<br />
the difference between a &quot;real universe&quot; or any &quot;fictive universe&quot; which
<br />
belongs to Platonia. We can go back to this point later. This has been
<br />
discovered by myself and independently Tim Maudlin gave a better
<br />
(more informative) proof. See ref in my thesis.
<br />
<br />8) So, if we are being simulated by a massive computer somewhere
<br />
in a real universe, then to make any first person verifiable prediction
<br />
we must take into account all the possible computations going through
<br />
our actual state. So &quot;the laws of physics&quot;, which we can temporarily
<br />
define as the laws of whatever we can predict consistently, should
<br />
be given by a measure on those 1-person computational histories.
<br />
<br />9) Now, from computer science and logic, startlingly enough perhaps,
<br />
we can isolate a measure on the 1-person comp histories, and this
<br />
give us the laws of physics (this is too technical to be put here, and
<br />
actually I have derived only the logical structure of the probability
<br />
one, but I got something non trivial and very close to a quantum logic
<br />
(which can be seen as the logic of the quantum probability one, as
<br />
von Neumann has shown).
<br />
<br />10) Having extracted the necessary (with comp) physical laws, let
<br />
us compare it with the laws we can infer from our neighborhood (actually
<br />
simulated by your massive computer). If it is the same, then we can
<br />
conclude we are NOT simulated by a particular massive computer
<br />
embedded in a universe (only apparently so for the inhabitant of the
<br />
&quot;universe&quot;). More precisely we are no more simulated by it than by
<br />
any of those emulated in Platonia. Or we discover some discrepancies
<br />
between the inferred &quot;physical&quot; laws (from our experiences inside the
<br />
massive computer) and the laws which comes from the measure on
<br />
all comp histories, then, either comp is false and we are then
<br />
obviously not executed by a massive computer, or we keep comp,
<br />
and then, like in a lucid dream, we can correctly infer we are simulated
<br />
by a computer.
<br />
Put in another way, *either* the massive computer simulates the exact
<br />
laws of physics (exact with comp = the laws extractible from the
<br />
measure on all 1-computations) in which case we belong to it but
<br />
in that case we belong also to all its &quot;copy&quot; in Platonia, and our
<br />
prediction or physics relies on all those copies (so that to say
<br />
we belong to the massive computer has no real meaning: if it stops,
<br />
nothing can happen to &quot;us&quot; for example); *or* the massive
<br />
computer simulates only an approximation of those laws (like a
<br />
brain during the night), and then we can in principle make the
<br />
comparison, and find the discrepancies, and conclude we inhabit
<br />
a fake reality ... OK?
<br />
<br />If you want we can discuss the more subtle point 7, but please
<br />
let me know if you have followed the nine other steps. You can also
<br />
look at my URL and at some of the everything-list explanations for
<br />
some precisions, but don't hesitate to ask any question if I have been
<br />
unclear (at any steps).
