<br />Along these lines, the noted Berkeley mathematician Steve Smale has 
<br />
worked with others (cryptographers Blum, Shub) on what it would mean to 
<br />
have a computer work with _real_ instead of integers. This seems close 
<br />
in spirit to much of both what Hal refers to above and to the more 
<br />
general &quot;quantum computation&quot; systems (*).
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;(* where machines must be set up with very high precision to compute, 
<br />
via Shor's or Grover's algorithms, for example, even small 
<br />
results...and where large results will require precisions of many, many 
<br />
decimal places. There is hope that Zurek-type quantum error correction 
<br />
coding (QECC)  can fix this scenario where materials have to be 
<br />
positioned to, say, 50 decimal places of accuracy to compute some level 
<br />
of computation (epsilon-delta argument, of course), but some recent 
<br />
reports cast doubt on the rising energy requirements of QECC. But I am 
<br />
not (yet) as knowledgeable about quantum computing as I hope to be in 
<br />
several months, so go to the source materials if interested.)
<br />
<br />Here is one of many readily-findable references to the work:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/5445/0">http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/context/5445/0</a>
<br />
<br />&quot;An important example are computations over the real numbers based on 
<br />
the model of Blum Shub Smale. Computation over . In 1989 Blum, Shub, 
<br />
and Smale [14] introduced a model for computations over the real 
<br />
numbers (and other rings as well) which is now usually called a BSS 
<br />
machine. The important difference with, say, the Turing model is that 
<br />
real numbers are treated as basic entities and that arithmetic 
<br />
operations on the reals are performed in a .... &quot;
<br />
<br />Here's a review article by John Casti:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.heise.de/tp/english/kolumnen/cas/2414/1.html">http://www.heise.de/tp/english/kolumnen/cas/2414/1.html</a>
<br />
<br />(Note that he calls the machine a BBS machine, getting it wrong. He was 
<br />
probably confusing it with the BBS (Blum-Blum-Shub) random number 
<br />
generator, which is not at all the same thing as a BSS mahine. But 
<br />
Casti writes engagingly, so this is a good introduction.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />In a hand-waving sort of way, computing with real numbers cuts through 
<br />
a lot of the work to build arbitrary-precision (or length) strings of 
<br />
symbols.
<br />
<br />But are the reals real?
<br />
<br />A fascinating topic, perhaps too much of a digression here. Read on if 
<br />
interested.
<br />
<br />A real number is a point on a line. Its expansion in any base is of 
<br />
course infinite. Does such a thing &quot;really&quot; exist?
<br />
<br />David Lewis would argue that yes, lines and points and real numbers 
<br />
really do exist, but that they are inaccessible to us (in the way that 
<br />
the worlds where Germany won the second world war really exist, but 
<br />
cannot be visited or communicated with). Lewis uses a closeness metric, 
<br />
where he shows how we may &quot;approach&quot; the world of the perfect Euclidean 
<br />
line or point or space. &quot;Take any drawn line, make the pencil line 
<br />
thinner and thinner, straighten out the kinks, etc.&quot;
<br />
<br />In the possible worlds ontology, real numbers and Euclidean lines exist 
<br />
as possible worlds, but nothing in our experience or in what we 
<br />
understand of the working of the world we are in lets us reach these 
<br />
possible worlds.
<br />
<br />To the constructivist, or intuitionist (a la Brouwer, Heyting), this 
<br />
says that a real number is only the name we give to a process of 
<br />
construction (e.g., Dedekind cuts, the familiar epsilon-delta 
<br />
construction of the real numbers). The real number is not an actual 
<br />
thing, but a process, an algorithm. (As someone quoted within the past 
<br />
day, Kronecker's &quot;God made the integers, all else is the work of man.&quot;)
<br />
<br />To cut to the chase, so to speak, the reals don't actually exist in our 
<br />
world except as ideals (other possible worlds we can approach but never 
<br />
reach).
<br />
<br />An attempt to build a machine computing with the reals would be 
<br />
interesting, if only to show how buried in the attempt would be 
<br />
algorithms and constructions which are simulating real numbers to some 
<br />
precision. (Perhaps this is where quantum computers break down, if they 
<br />
do.)
<br />
<br />But the BSS work sheds a lot of interesting light on computability, 
<br />
further illuminating the fascinating links between the theory of 
<br />
recursive functions (aka lambda calculus), cartesian closed categories, 
<br />
and the effective topos of Hyland and others.
<br />
<br />By the way, once we think in terms of the real numbers and points on 
<br />
lines and planes not actually having any real existence, the 
<br />
idealization of a manifold (e.g., a Riemannian spacetime manifold) as 
<br />
being infinitely divisible becomes more and more farfetched.
<br />
<br />(Now it may well be that spacetime is in fact an ideal manifold, 
<br />
divisible and measurable at scales of 10^-35 m, or even at scales of 
<br />
10^-100 m. But it will not be surprising at all to many of us if 
<br />
spacetime is quantized, or foamy, or latticelike, at approximately 
<br />
Planck-length scales. What those lattice points are &quot;made of&quot; is itself 
<br />
a question, but the smoothness and continuity of spacetime is not 
<br />
necessarily &quot;real all the way down.&quot; Cf. the usual books and articles 
<br />
by MTW (&quot;Gravitation&quot;), Smolin (&quot;Three Roads...&quot;), Rovelli, 
<br />
Markopoulou, Crane, Baez, etc. for more on spin foams, lattice 
<br />
structures, etc. Greg Egan's &quot;Schild's Ladder&quot; novel has a description 
<br />
early on, a fictional description, of course.)
