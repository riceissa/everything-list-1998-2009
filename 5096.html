Hi Georges,
<br />
<br />I got that mail before. And I did answer it. Are you sure you send the 
<br />
right mail?
<br />

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems, but it isn't. Well, actually I have known *one* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematician,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (a russian logician) who indeed makes a serious try to develop
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some mathematics without that infinite act of faith (I don't recall
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; its name for the moment). Such attempt are known as &quot;ultrafinitism&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course a lot of people (especially during the week-end) *pretend*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not doing that infinite act of faith, but do it all the time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implicitly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;This is not what I meant. I did not refer to people not willing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;to accept that natural numbers exist at all but to people not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;wlling to accept that natural numbers exist *by themselves*.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Rather, they want to see them either as only a production of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;human (or human-like) people or only a production of a God.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What I mean is that their arithmetical property are independent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think this is very different. I could argue that even if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;natural numbers were not out there, as soon as anybody consider
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them, their properties automatically come with and impose themselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Even this seemingly weaker statement can be contested and it is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;actually weaker but equivalent since there might be no other way than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this one for natural numbers to be out there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some people do argue that there is no arithmetical property
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;independent of us because there is no thing on which they would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;apply independentkly of us. What we would call their arithmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;properties is simply a set of tautologies that do come with them
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;when they are considered but exist no more than them when they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are not considered.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Do you think those people believe that the proposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;17 is prime&quot; is meaningless without a human in the neighborhood?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot; &quot;17 is prime&quot; is meaningless without a human in the neighborhood&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is exactly the kind of claim these people make (possibly generalizing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the concept of human to aliens and Gods). After discussing with some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of them I think they actually believe what they claim. I am not sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;however that we always fully understand each other and that you or I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would exactly understand such a claim in the same way as they do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Giving that I hope getting some understanding of the complex human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from something simpler (number property) the approach of those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; people will never work, for me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And certainly vice versa. Though it is difficult to have them saying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it explicitely I have the feeling that the reason why they do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;want the natural numbers to be out there and even as not possibly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being considered as out there is that they do not accept that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complex human be understood from something simpler (number property).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They do not even accept the idea being considered, were it as a mere
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conjecture or working hypothesis. Their more official argument is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that such a view would prevent the foundation of human dignity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Also, I would take (without added explanations) an expression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like &quot;numbers are a production of God&quot; as equivalent to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; arithmetical realism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Yes and there are several ways to understand this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;And I said &quot;unfortunately&quot; because some not only do not want to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;see natural numbers as existing by themselves but they do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;want the idea to be simply presented as logically possible and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;even see/designate evil in people working at popularizing it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OK, but then some want you being dead because of the color of the skin,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or the length of your nose, ... I am not sure it is not premature wanting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to enlighten everyone at once ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I guess you were only talking about those hard-aristotelians who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; like to dismiss Plato's questions as childish. Evil ? Perhaps could you be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; more precise on those people. I have not met people seeing evil
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in arithmetical platonism, have you?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have not met any of them physically but I had discussion with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some of them via Internet. There might not be so many of them but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;there are. You will find, at least in the US, a lot of people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;considering the views of evolution and/or of the big-bang as evil.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If they finally have to abandon these positions due to the amount
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of evidence in favor of it, the last line of defence for their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conception of a personal God and for a significant role for Him
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be at the level of artihmetical realism. Artihmetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;realism by itself (not from a distinct personal God) is therefore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seen as evil by them. As I mentionned, they usually do not put it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that way. Rather they argue that such a view would prevent the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;foundation of human dignity and the like.
