</em><br />
<br />I agree that it isn't really a question of finite or infinite, rather
<br />
how infinite is the MWs.
<br />
<br />I fully understand and agree with your point about anything less being
<br />
an arbitrary condition. I think I was between ten and twelve when I
<br />
first concluded the universe must be infinite based upon the principle
<br />
that nature would not allow part of what is possible to exist. At the
<br />
time I put it, if one world managed to cheat its way past nothingness,
<br />
all else that is possible would also find the same way out.
<br />
<br />Again, the question of how infinite is the Universe that contains MWs.
<br />
Or said otherwise, how vast or how ruled is the possible world, assuming
<br />
all possibilities exist? In contrast to the seemingly necessary
<br />
conclusion that all possibilities is a radical infinitude, one that is
<br />
both incomprehensible and chaotic (what we would refer to as chaotic) is
<br />
the sensibility and consistency of our own world (to us) throughout the
<br />
passage of time.
<br />
<br />Considered first there is the set of all possible MWs consistent with
<br />
the forces and laws of nature responsible for shaping the cosmos, and I
<br />
assume all are consistent with the Big Bang origin. This is a small set
<br />
compared to a radical group of, for example, different origins, which
<br />
are imaginable to some degree. A far greater set would include all
<br />
possibilities that depart from our forces of nature, which may or may
<br />
not be imaginable. And here I question whether this line can be crossed.
<br />
Does the possible realm actually cross this line?
<br />
<br />If what is properly true physically or mathematically; if what is our
<br />
reality can be different in some other way of existing, such would
<br />
require that it is possible for our laws to break down. So if what is
<br />
real here for us is not real elsewhere, if such irreconcilable worlds
<br />
exist, then that set would be far greater and even seems to be the
<br />
ultimate set, if not simply defined as chaos. And within that chaos we
<br />
can imagine our world. Presently most who expect chaos justify the
<br />
consistency and structure of our space-time by imagining our reality is
<br />
closed, somehow cut-off from the greater chaos, for whatever reason, the
<br />
most reasonable proposal being the anthropic principle. But there is a
<br />
mistake being made, because we so innately expect a radical infinity to
<br />
be indefinite.
<br />
<br />There is actually no way to escape a radical influence of the deemed
<br />
chaos. If we imagine a far larger set of worlds than those that are
<br />
somehow closed and internally consistent and so rational, which are
<br />
rational up till any given moment, but then suddenly decay, the closed
<br />
is one possibility compared to the temporarily closed. The exclusion of
<br />
those worlds as not the most possible for our future at any given moment
<br />
places us in an arbitrarily configured system, which has to have a
<br />
reason for being so, a reason that would not be consistent with the
<br />
cosmology of a radical infinitude or chaos.
<br />
<br />I am even to the point now that I disbelieve the meaning of the word
<br />
chaos, in the same context that I recognize the meaning of non-existence
<br />
is an anomaly, since there is no such state or possible meaning for the
<br />
word to represent, and because of a more complex theory of my own that
<br />
what we call disorder is actually a different kind of order, so that
<br />
there is actually two kinds of order in nature, making the order of one
<br />
the disorder of the other.
<br />
<br />But before I lose anyone, my concluding point is my own conclusion that
<br />
what is possible is far more definitive than we all expect. One idea is
<br />
that the possible realm is satisfied by being all possible states,
<br />
rather than all possible systems, and that systems are secondary
<br />
substratum, not more than but contained within, like potentiality, but
<br />
actual. For example, in binary, there are two possible states. We can
<br />
write a billion computer programs with those two states, or an infinite
<br />
number, and we can imagine them all running simultaneously, but the
<br />
ensemble of all possible programs does not include more than what is
<br />
possible from the two undistorted original elementary states. The
<br />
radical infinity of what is possible, in this case, includes 0 and 1.
<br />
Everything else is inside.
<br />
<br />As scientists are now getting serious about MWs, perhaps the expectation
<br />
of simplicity and fundamentals is being overlooked, similar to how
<br />
thinking has always evolved, from chaos to clarity.
