As I wrote in my response to Russell Standish:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I think [Russell's] 'kicks back' = physical = measurable in some
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;way, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* I think 'exists' is a generic, irreducible, ultimate value. In
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fact it is THE generic, irreducible, ultimate value and it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;underlies mathematical objects such as numbers as well as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything else.
<br />
<br />I think also [something of the waggy tail of this dog] that we are beset 
<br />
by irreducible paradox in our experience as conscious beings, which does 
<br />
not have to be terminally traumatic but does mean that we will always be 
<br />
prone to potentially embarrassing mistakes of perception and thought.
<br />
<br />NB: I will be happy to be proven wrong, but this will require that the 
<br />
proof is translatable into 'plain-English' :-)  and, preferably points 
<br />
to clear empirical evidence for backup.
<br />
<br />My main problem with Comp is that it needs several unprovable 
<br />
assumptions to be accepted. For example the Yes Doctor hypothesis, 
<br />
wherein it is assumed that it must be possible to digitally emulate some 
<br />
or all of a person's body/brain function and the person will not notice 
<br />
any difference. The Yes Doctor hypothesis is a particular case of the 
<br />
digital emulation hypothesis in which it is asserted that, basically, 
<br />
ANYTHING can be digitally emulated if one had enough computational 
<br />
resources available. As this seems to me to be almost a version of Comp 
<br />
[at least as far as I have got with reading Bruno's exposition] then 
<br />
from my simple minded perspective it looks rather like assuming the very 
<br />
thing that needs to be demonstrated.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruno:'All this provides mathematical clean interpretation of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neoplatonist researchers (like Plato, Plotinus, Proclus). If you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;want I show that concerning machine's theology it is wrong to reify
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matter or nature.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that I am using the term &quot;materialism&quot; in a weaker sense than
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its use in philosophy of mind. But materialism I mean the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metaphysical reification of Matter. The idea that some primitive
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;matter exists. '
<br />
<br /><br />MP: Well at least I can say now that I have some inkling of what 
<br />
'machine's theology' means. However, as far as I can see it is inherent 
<br />
in the nature of consciousness to reify something. I have not seen 
<br />
anywhere a refutation of my favoured understanding of consciousness 
<br />
which is that a brain is creating a representation of its world and a 
<br />
representation of itself and representations of the relationships 
<br />
between self and world. The 'world' in question is reified by the 
<br />
maintenance and updating of these representations, this is what the 
<br />
brain does, this is what it is FOR. Our contemplation of numbers and 
<br />
other mathematical objects or the abstract entities posited as particles 
<br />
and energy packets etc., by modern physics is experientially and 
<br />
logically second to the pre-linguistic/non-linguistic representation of 
<br />
self in the world, mediated by cell assemblies constituting basic 
<br />
qualia. [In passing; a quale must embody this triple aspect of 
<br />
representing something about the world, something about oneself and 
<br />
something significant about relationships *between* that piece of the 
<br />
world and that rendition of 'self'.]
<br />
<br />I appreciate that the UDA and related treatments in mathematical 
<br />
philosophy, can be rigorous, and enormously potent in their implications 
<br />
for further speculation and development within their universe of 
<br />
discourse, but I remain very sceptical of any advertised potential to 
<br />
bootstrap the rest of the universe.
<br />
<br />I have been trying to create a worthy reply to Jason's posting of 14 Jan 
<br />
07 on the Evidence for the simulation argument. In it I am trying to 
<br />
confront this very issue I think .I guess my basic complaint comes down 
<br />
to these things:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* actual existence is an irreducible value or Values
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* structure entails more than just the existence of mathematical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;objects of/with numerically representable values, it entails
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;differences and separation which are not just conceptual but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ontological, so maybe what I am saying is that structure is in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some way irreducible, which might be better put in some minimalist
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;formula like: structuring has an irreducible minimum ontological
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensionality
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* this seems to require that we acknowledge that things which really
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exist ARE SOMEWHERE now - and I know Bruno has already asserted
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that this is not so 'if Comp is true' but I have certainly not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;encountered any kind of plain-English exposition that refutes the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;problem as I see it
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* the Church Thesis, as I understand it, is an assertion about
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;digital computations saying, more or less, that any kind of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;digital computation can be emulated by and within another digital
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computation system, and this is fine as far as it goes but I have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seen an argument put that there are various aspects of physical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;existence which cannot be translated exactly into digital
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;representation, so any digital *emulation* will be a Zenoverse,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o this was in an edition of New Scientist Magazine several
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years ago [and I will try and track down my paper copy
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because I don't have access to the on-line version like I do
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for Scientific American Magazine]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of course Bruno and others will argue that they are not saying that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OUR universe is being emulated but merely that it is numerically
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implemented, but as far as I can see all the 'teleporter' brand of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arguments DO rely on emulation which must thus need effectively
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;infinite resources if they are to 'fool' a scientifically competent
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;victim [for indeed the fate of he or she who is 'read' will be death
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at that time, or else at very least they will be damaged goods when
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the door is opened again :-]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* entropy is a significant feature of our universe which affects
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every aspect of our existence, and I maintain that, as much as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anything else, it is the PRICE of our existence [of course Xians
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like to complicate this simple observation with subtle
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;refinements, but I am Ex-Xian so I ignore these and do not enter
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into discussion about them]. I reckon it is valid to look upon
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entropy in our daily lives as the expansion of the universe writ
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;small. Were the universe not expanding, there would be no space
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visible between the stars in the night sky, so the whole sky
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everywhere and always would look like the Sun and 'here' would be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same temperature as 'there', i.e. to hot for comfort  :-) As
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we exist and reliable evidence seems to indicate that we live in a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universe which is both unimaginably big and expanding, I believe
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have to take entropy seriously. I think this poses problems for
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;theories of infinite alternative universes which are purported to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have some kind of connection with ours.
<br />
<br />And there I ran out of steam!
<br />
<br />Regards
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course! Like babies can use their brain without understanding it ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     SO, yes I will ask: What do you mean by 'physical'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It concerns the stable appearance described by hypothetical &quot;physical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theories&quot; (like classical mechanics, QM, etc.).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I found an argument showing that IF comp(*) is correct THEN those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stable appearances emerge from arithmetic as seen from internalized 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; point of views. Those can be described in computer science, and It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; makes the comp hyp falsifiable: just extract the physical appearance 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from comp and compare with nature. I will say more in a reply to Stathis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (*) comp means there exist a tuiring emulable level of description of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;myself&quot; (whatever I am), meaning I would notice a functional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution made at that level).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     And next: what do you mean by 'exist'?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are mainly two sort of existence. The absolute fundamental one, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the internal or phenomenological one.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you understand the Universal Dovetailer Argument, you can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand that, assuming the comp hypothesis, it is enough to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpret existence by the existential quantifier in some first order 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; logic description of arithmetic. (like when you say &quot;it exist a prime 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All the other existence (like headache, but also bosons, fermions, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anyons, ...) are phenomelogical, and can be described by &quot;It exist a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stable and coherent collection of machines correctly believing from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their point of view in &quot;bosons&quot;, etc. (I simplify a bit).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you want, I say that IF comp is true, only numbers exist, all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rest are dreams with relative degree of stability.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     These are very basic questions, and in our context here, 'dumb'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     questions for sure, but without some clarification on how people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     are using these words, I don't think I can go any further.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are welcome, and I don't believe there is dumb questions. I have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; developed the Universal dovetailer argument, in the seventies, and it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was a pedagogical tools for explaining the mathematical theory which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consist in interviewing an universal machine on its possible physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have published all this in the eighties and defend it as a thesis in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the nineties. I am aware it goes against materialism (based on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concept of primary (aristotelian) materialism.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; All this provides mathematical clean interpretation of neoplatonist 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; researchers (like Plato, Plotinus, Proclus). If you want I show that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concerning machine's theology it is wrong to reify matter or nature.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that I am using the term &quot;materialism&quot; in a weaker sense than its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use in philosophy of mind. But materialism I mean the metaphysical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reification of Matter. The idea that some primitive matter exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hope this helps a bit. Perhaps you could study my last version of UDA 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in my SANE04 paper to see the point. You can ask question for any 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step. Then if you are willing to invest in mathematical logic, you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will see how the UDA can be made entirely mathematical *and* falsifiable.
