<br />
Jesse, nobody on this list is unaware of Carter's paper, to which I and
<br />
others have referred in several of our papers. The point is, life is a
<br />
high-level concept, not relevant to the more fundamental debate I thought we
<br />
were having. What was the point of Anthropic Reasoning 101?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So my question for you is, when you say &quot;the anthropic principle is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universally mis-applied,&quot; are you saying that you think only Carter's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; original version of anthropic reasoning is valid, while the copernican
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anthropic principle is not?
</em><br />
<br />As I thought was obvious form my posts, both assume that there is more than
<br />
just this current thought. Both apply to 'life' in 'space' etc. Both assume
<br />
a physical universe which is the substrate for a system which generates
<br />
thoughts. I think this is bollocks. A 'physical' universe is a massive
<br />
assumption, which I say again: I do not share. I assert that only your
<br />
current thought exists, as far as you know. An your current thought includes
<br />
a contemplation of the anthropic principle.
<br />
<br />Or do you accept the copernican anthropic
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle but think the &quot;reference class&quot; can only consist of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moments that are using anthropic reasoning?  Or something else?
</em><br />
<br />Yes, the reference is OMs which include thoughts about the anthropic
<br />
principle.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;You ask: &quot;Is it just amazing luck that I find myself to be one of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;extremely rare complex observer-moments?&quot; - surely you don't mean this.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;That
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;is equivaent to the traditional question &quot;Is it amazing luck that the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;universe supports my life&quot;, to which the traditional mis-application of
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;anthropic principle is the ripost.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This ripost only works if you assume multiple universes/regions, although
</em><br />
I
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suppose you might say it doesn't work even then.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Yes, I do say that it doesn't work even then. It assumes that 'life'
<br />
requires a suitable physical substrate. I believe that this is almost
<br />
certainly false.
<br />
<br />Clearly, OMs containing thoughts about the anthropic principle can exist.
<br />
That much we can say. We have no firm evidence to suggest that any other
<br />
constructs exist (although, of course, my current OM does include 'memories'
<br />
of other thoughts).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Obviously, if you were not one of these rare complex observer moments you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;would not be asking why you were one. Luck has nothing to do with it. It
</em><br />
is
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;a 100% certainty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You misunderstood my point.  I was saying that if my &quot;reference class&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; includes all &quot;self-referential thoughts&quot;, and if my definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; self-referential thoughts is such that simple ones greatly outnumber
</em><br />
complex
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ones, then I can *not* use anthropic reasoning (of either sort) to explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why I find myself to be a rare complex one rather than a simple one...so
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fact that I am a complex one would be very, very lucky in this case.  This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then becomes a reason to say the original choice of reference class may
</em><br />
have
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been incorrect.
</em><br />
<br />See above. It is pure speculation that 'simpler' thoughts can exist. I'm not
<br />
sure how you define thought complexity. It is perfectly likely that the
<br />
thought you are having now is the simplest thought in existence - even
<br />
though it includes speculation about what possible, 'simpler', thoughts
<br />
_might_ exist.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And this is still true if you replace &quot;self-referential thought&quot; with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;thought about the anthropic principle&quot; or something similar.  I can write
</em><br />
a
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simple program that prints out &quot;I am thinking about the anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle&quot;, and the number of physical systems that implement this program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is probably still much greater than the number of systems that implement
</em><br />
the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; complex processes going on in my brain (unless you take Hans Moravec's
</em><br />
view,
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which any system can be seen as implementing any 'thought' under the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right mapping).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
You don't even know that 'you' have a 'computer' - something that itself
<br />
requires a 'physical world'. You are making dozens of unjustifiable leaps
<br />
here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in that case, why do you think that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moments of the laws of physics operating normally should be any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more common than observer-moments seeing crazy violations of physical law?
</em><br />
<br />Can you not understand that I don't believe in physics? There is no proof of
<br />
a physical world. There is no proof of a physical world. There is no proof
<br />
of a physical world. There is no proof of a physical world. There is no
<br />
proof of a physical world. There is no proof of a physical world.  There are
<br />
no laws. There is just this OM, that is all 'I' know. All 'I' know is this
<br />
current thought.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would a program that prints out &quot;I am thinking about the anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; principle&quot; count as a &quot;thought&quot; about the anthropic principle?  If not, on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what basis do you rule it out?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
See above.
<br />
