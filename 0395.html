<br />
Several people have noticed that a very simple program can create a
<br />
pattern or even, by some definitions, a process which imitates our minds.
<br />
A trivial counting program eventually creates all possible patterns,
<br />
and you can map any string into a four-dimensional space-time diagram
<br />
which is isomorphic to an entire universe.  It seems, then, that even
<br />
a trivial program like this ought to be able to create structures which
<br />
are identical to our minds down to the smallest detail, and therefore,
<br />
perhaps, we should conclude that we are likely to be the product of such
<br />
a trivial program.
<br />
<br />If I understand him, Wei suggests that a way around this is to notice that
<br />
the valid mind or valid universe produced in this way is buried amidst
<br />
an unimaginably large amount of garbage.  To estimate the contribution a
<br />
particular program makes to instantiating a mind we should look not only
<br />
at the size of the program, but also at the difficulty of identifying
<br />
or locating the mind amongst its output.  Here we have a very simple
<br />
program, but if we then wanted to point to where in its output we had
<br />
a mind-creating universe being produced, we would have to specify a
<br />
huge amount of information.  Combining these two we find that the total
<br />
information needed to both *create* and *locate* the mind in the output
<br />
of the program is very large, making the contribution of that program
<br />
be very small.
<br />
<br />This approach also offers a solution to the problem that even in our
<br />
own universe, you can select subsets of, say, water molecule collisions
<br />
which produce patterns identical to our own consciousness.  A vat of water
<br />
as big as my brain has billions of water molecules in each region which
<br />
is of the size of my neurons, and in the time my neurons fire, billions
<br />
of water molecule collisions will occur in each such region.  By paying
<br />
attention to only a tiny subset of these water molecule collisions, we
<br />
can find a pattern of collisions which is identical to the pattern of
<br />
firings of my neurons when I am thinking.  Of course, to do this we have
<br />
to ignore the billions of other collisions we aren't paying attention to,
<br />
but it might seem that adding more collisions cannot change the existence
<br />
of the patterns that are sufficient for consciousness.
<br />
<br />However, Wei's approach calls attention to the size of the program needed
<br />
to select those molecules to pay attention to.  In practice we would seem
<br />
to need a full-sized neural simulation to do that.  This would be a very
<br />
large program, so the actual contribution of such random collisions to
<br />
my consciousness would be vanishingly small.
<br />
<br />This approach seems to move away from the question, is this system
<br />
conscious?  That is no longer seen as having a yes/no answer.  Instead, we
<br />
try to say, how much contribution does this system make to a given mind?
<br />
If we can have a short program to define the laws of physics which govern
<br />
the system, and another short program can identify the mind states with
<br />
states of the system, then it makes a relatively large contribution.
<br />
But if either of these two programs must be large, then it makes a
<br />
small contribution.
<br />
<br />It is somewhat counter-intuitive to downgrade the mental contribution
<br />
of a pattern just because it is lost among a large amount of noise.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the external perspective, maybe it makes sense; information that
</em><br />
is buried is less useful than information which is easily exposed.
<br />
But mental activity seems like an &quot;inner&quot; quality; the string doesn't
<br />
&quot;know&quot; whether it is surrounded by noise or is out in the open; it should
<br />
be equally conscious either way.
<br />
<br />However if we accept the initial idea that short programs make more of
<br />
a contribution, I don't see a problem in saying that short *output* also
<br />
makes more of a contribution.  Why, after all, should minds produced by
<br />
short programs be considered to make a larger contribution than those
<br />
for long ones?  We have to make some implicit assumptions in order to
<br />
make this work.  Sometimes we imagine an actual computer cranking out
<br />
programs and running them, with short programs getting more run time
<br />
than long ones.
<br />
<br />With this kind of mechanistic picture, we could also imagine that programs
<br />
which take more time to produce their output could also make less of a
<br />
contribution.  Programs which produce larger output could be penalized
<br />
in this way or simply by virtue of their greater resource requirements.
<br />
<br />There does not seem to be a unique measuring system for estimating
<br />
the contribution of any given program to the overall reality.
<br />
Penalizing programs for program size, run time, or output size all seem
<br />
somewhat plausible.  With this kind of model it does make sense that the
<br />
contribution a given output pattern makes would depend on details of how
<br />
it was produced by the program, including how much other output there was.
