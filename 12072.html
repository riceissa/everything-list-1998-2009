<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was going to give my two cents when I was so rudely interrupted by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more immediate reality: work.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My opinion on the marketing aspect (as a mathematician and engineer,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; laugh here; then stop laughing and go to next statement;), would agree
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with Brent's, something like &quot;Machine Theology&quot; would be an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eye-catching first book that introduces people to the mind-bending
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ideas, sort of like Penrose's Emperor's New Mind, I know that's not a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; good example.  But then there's the follow-up larger book (like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Penrose's Road To Reality) that is intended to help with the actual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; integration of the new concepts into the existing body of knowledge, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the morphing of existing knowledge into the new paradigm (even though I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still don't believe that your paradigm and mine are ultimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compatible, but you never know for sure ;)... ).  You should expect
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some major collisions between yours and existing paradigms, including
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finding out that major parts of your arguments, or all, are wrong,


</em><br />
I have believed a long time that I should be wrong, but I seriously 
<br />
begin to doubt that.
<br />
It would be a relief if someone could show I am wrong or even just show 
<br />
that some part of the argumentation is not well supported. But except 
<br />
for minor point this has never happened.
<br />
I could go back to pure number theory which I appreciate, not for the 
<br />
love of truth, but for the love of beauty ....


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as Penrose has, and having to backpeddle or totally modify, or start
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from square one with the kernel of truth that remains after the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; collisions.


</em><br />
I don't want to look presomptuous, but there has been people very 
<br />
motivated in showing my work being wrong, but except for rumors nothing 
<br />
concrete has ever been provided.




<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But in the end, you will have added to the advance of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge, just as I believe Penrose has in spite of his mistakes.


</em><br />
Sure. Penrose and Lucas did an important mistake which is recurring 
<br />
again. But logicians today are not interested in philosophy or 
<br />
physics---if only because it has been a big struggle for them to make 
<br />
logic accepted as a branch of pure mathematics----and they stop reading 
<br />
a paper once they see an error. Some papers can be rejected if they 
<br />
give too much motivation ....



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; envision that somewhere down the line somebody might write a book that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; takes the kernel of truth from your collisions and goes to the next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; step.  That's sort of what Penrose said he hopes happens with his Road
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to Reality.  This won't be it, but an example might be something like,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;New Theory of Everything Proposes A Totally New Way Of Looking At The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Whole Quantum Mechanics Vs. General Relativity Landscape&quot;.  Of course
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that would be in the context of how your paradigm effects the problems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; physicists are trying to solve.  But then there would be another book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about &quot;New Theory Of Everything Proposes A Totally New Way Of Looking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At The Mind-Body Problem&quot;... for the philosophers etc. It just seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that this whole process is just too big to try to get our minds around
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at one point in history.


</em><br />
Yes but you exaggerate a little bit too also (I know your point is 
<br />
laughing .... ).
<br />
You know I can summarize my thesis like this:

<br />
&quot;If you are interested in the Truth, look deep inside your Self.&quot;

<br />
Now I am modern, and what I really say is:

<br />
&quot;If you are interested in the Truth, and if you are too busy to look 
<br />
deep inside yourself, then you can program a Universal Machine to look 
<br />
deep inside her Self (and if you are too busy to write the program, 
<br />
download it on my web page, or copy the main algorithm from Boolos' 
<br />
book or Solovay's paper&quot;.


<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (even though I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; still don't believe that your paradigm and mine are ultimately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; compatible, but you never know for sure ;)


</em><br />
It is still possible that we are compatible (or that you are compatible 
<br />
with comp). Just answer this question: could it be that your &quot;personal 
<br />
God&quot; is &quot;yourself&quot;?
<br />
About this, have you read books by Alan Watts?  Or by eastern religious 
<br />
people among those who tend toward the idea that &quot;I am the unnameable&quot;, 
<br />
whatever &quot;I&quot; could refer temporarily ...
<br />
In that case, the apparent difference between you and me could be that 
<br />
I emphasize on the first and second hypostases (the zero and third 
<br />
person machine point of view), and you seem to emphasize, I guess like 
<br />
George Levy and David Nyman, on the third hypostase (the first person 
<br />
pov). It is something which I find extraordinary: that the first person 
<br />
inherites the main &quot;godlike&quot; attribute: total unnameability. And the 
<br />
order of the hypostases is immaterial ...
<br />
Of course in our occidental country this move is rarely appreciated ....



<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course I'm hoping for something like &quot;New
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Theory Of Everything Finds A Meta-Correspondence (Called The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Marchal-Caylor Correspondence) Between Logic And Logos&quot;  (a la Galois
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Correspondence).  (you can laugh here without stopping...)

</em><br />
... thanks!

<br />
:)

<br />
Bruno
