</em><br />
<br />I can agree with the thrust of this, but let me break it down a bit.
<br />
<br />I agree that, &quot;Observers are defined by the programs that generate them.&quot;
<br />
One complication is that any output, including an observer, may be
<br />
produced by multiple programs, which leads to Bruno's first-person
<br />
indeterminacy.  But that's not important here.
<br />
<br />I pretty much agree that, &quot;If we identify universes with programs then
<br />
observers are just embedded universes.&quot;  However I think the terminology
<br />
is being stretched quite a bit here, calling observers embedded universes.
<br />
What I would say is, programs produce every possible kind of information
<br />
structure.  We could call all of these structures &quot;universes&quot;, although
<br />
the word is going to be more applicable in some cases than others.
<br />
For example, there is a program which outputs the sequence of integers.
<br />
Is that sequence a &quot;universe&quot;?  It's a stretch, but okay, we can call
<br />
it that.
<br />
<br />But there are also programs which output the dynamic information patterns
<br />
that recognizably correspond to observers.  The structure of such programs
<br />
is a key part of the &quot;book&quot; which Lee Corbin suggests I have been in
<br />
effect writing.  If we stick to the definition that all outputs are
<br />
(in some sense) &quot;universes&quot; then yes, I agree with your statement that
<br />
observers can be thought of as embedded universes.
<br />
<br />Actually I'm not sure I fully agree about the &quot;embedded&quot; part.  I'm not
<br />
sure what you mean by that.  Maybe you mean that the observer (whom we
<br />
have defined as a universe) is himself embedded in a larger universe,
<br />
the world we see around us.  I agree that this will often be the case.
<br />
<br />&quot;An observer moment is just a qualia experienced by the observer,
<br />
which is just an event in the observer's universe.&quot;  I think I see what
<br />
you're saying here.  If we focus on the observer as a &quot;universe&quot; we can
<br />
think of him as being sort of self-contained.  Yes, in practice he is
<br />
probably embedded in a larger world, but we can restrict our attention
<br />
to the observer himself, as an abstract process that is going through
<br />
a sequence of states.  These momentary states are what you are calling
<br />
the &quot;events&quot; of the observer &quot;universe&quot;, and these would correspond
<br />
to observer-moments.
<br />
<br />In our space-time we have a notion of &quot;events&quot; as the four dimensional
<br />
points out of which space-time is built.  But you are saying that the
<br />
internal structure of an observer as a sort of self-contained universe is
<br />
not really four-dimensional.  Maybe it's trillion-dimensional.  It is an
<br />
abstract structure which, while embedded in our space-time, exists on its
<br />
own terms with its own internal data representation.  You are defining
<br />
&quot;events&quot; within that data structure, that self-contained universe.
<br />
They don't have a direct correspondence with four dimensional space-time
<br />
events in the larger universe that the observer is embedded in.
<br />
<br />This reminds me of Jesse Mazer's conjecture about consciousness as a
<br />
causal pattern.  I asked whether he could imagine an abstract causal
<br />
network as capturing the essence of a given moment of consciousness.
<br />
I could see that concept as being closely related to your idea of the
<br />
observer as a universe, embedded in a larger structure.  However I may
<br />
be merely projecting both of your ideas into my own framework.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think that Hal's idea of identifying brain patterns with OMs will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; successful. The brain is just the hardware that runs a program (the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer).
</em><br />
<br />I don't think we necessarily disagree about this.  In
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m7453.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m7453.html</a> I wrote:
<br />
<br />&quot;To apply this concept to observers, we first need to think of an observer
<br />
as an information pattern.  I adopt a block universe perspective and think
<br />
of time as a dimension.  Then we can see the dynamic activity that is
<br />
part of an observer's thinking as producing a pattern in space and time.&quot;
<br />
<br />So I have an observer as being a *dynamic* pattern in space and time.
<br />
It is not just the hardware, it is the temporal pattern of activation of
<br />
the neural network.  I then went into painstaking albeit crude detail in
<br />
the rest of that message to try to estimate just how much information
<br />
it would take to capture a certain number of seconds of firing of the
<br />
neural network.  Again, this is a pattern of activity, a series of
<br />
related events, not just a static snapshot.
<br />
<br />I also discussed in detail in that message how an observer as a self
<br />
contained information pattern could be considered to be embedded in a
<br />
larger universe, and how that would affect the measure of the observer.
<br />
That seems very much like your conception above, if I understood it
<br />
correctly.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I run a simulation of our solar system on a computer, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relevant events are e.g. that Jupiter is in such and such a position. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is associated with the state of the transistors of the computer running the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program. But that same pattern could arise in a completely different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; calculation. You would have to extract exactly what program is running on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the machine to be able to define OMs like that. To do that you need to feed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the program with different kinds of input and study the output, otherwise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you'll fall prey to the famous ''clock paradox'' (you can map the time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolution of a clock to that of any object, including brains).
</em><br />
<br />I'm not sure I fully understand this, but I'll make two comments.  First,
<br />
a simulation of the solar system is vastly simpler than the calculation
<br />
needed to create an observer.  Intuitions based on the first case will
<br />
fail when applied to the other.  It may be plausible that two different
<br />
calculations could create matching representations of Jupiter's orbit.
<br />
But it's completely implausible that two calculations could accidentally
<br />
both create the same sequence of observer moments.  I estimated in the
<br />
message above that the chance of that happening would be one in 2^(10^18).
<br />
No human alive can even begin to grasp the impossibility of such an event.
<br />
Think of the most absolutely, totally, completely impossible event you
<br />
could ever imagine, and you won't be anywhere near as improbable as that.
<br />
It is beyond human comprehension.
<br />
<br />Second, this clock paradox has been discussed before.  Years ago Jacques
<br />
Mallah on this list pointed out that algorithmic complexity disposes of
<br />
it neatly.  Sure, you can map any two calculations together, but if the
<br />
map becomes bigger than the calculations, then all the correspondence
<br />
is in the map and none in the calculations.
<br />
<br />In measure terms, it still comes down to how short a program you can
<br />
write to produce the output that corresponds to an observer.  Go ahead
<br />
and write your clock or counter program, but its output does not match my
<br />
canonical representation of an observer moment.  The challenge is to write
<br />
a translation program that turns the output of your clock into the OM's
<br />
canonical representation (which is 10^18 bits in size!).  Such a program
<br />
is going to be as big as the OM data itself.  The clock is of no help.
<br />
<br />On the other hand consider a program which (we would agree) really
<br />
does output or create the observer-moment, but perhaps not in the nice
<br />
canonical representation I might have defined.  Then we can write
<br />
a mapping program which will be relatively short, to turn one data
<br />
representation into another.  Even though we have 10^18 bits of data,
<br />
the mapping program will still be much smaller than this, because its
<br />
complexity does not depend on the size of the data to be translated.
<br />
This shows that the program really did create the observer-moment, because
<br />
there was little extra data in the map program.  The correspondence was
<br />
in the calculation, not in the map.
<br />
<br />With such large data sets as observer-moments, the point becomes
<br />
very clear.  There is effectively no ambiguity about whether a given
<br />
calculation instantiates an OM or not.  Clocks don't do it; neural network
<br />
simulations can do it (with proper input); universe simulations can do it
<br />
(using a subset of their output).
