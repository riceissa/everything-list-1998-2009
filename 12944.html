<br />
The word infinity comes from the latin word meaning Unbounded, or
<br />
indistinct.
<br />
<br />In geometry and the world, what makes something distinct from
<br />
something else? Only a few things: Area's, dots and boundaries. Lines
<br />
are just merged dots or dots stitched together (merged) or separated
<br />
(dispersed).
<br />
<br />Now there are many definitions of infinity, but to think of infinity
<br />
in the general sense it makes sense if you begin with boolean logic.
<br />
In boolean logic this would mean, either filled or not. either you
<br />
exist, or you do not. Either on or off, instantaneous velocity or
<br />
transmission velocity. There is no sequence of in between movements in
<br />
boolean space, you are either in the space (filling it) or not filling
<br />
it. You &quot;Jump&quot; instantaneously between areas in boolean space. To help
<br />
think about this concept, imagine 2 concentric circles on the ground,
<br />
and you jump between them and land exactly in the middle of each one,
<br />
except when you make the jump you are instantaneously transported from
<br />
the middle of the first circle to the middle of the next. The empty
<br />
space in the 2nd circle is instantly transported (displaced) to the
<br />
first circle behind you. (it helps to imagine it as 2 spheres
<br />
connected by an &quot;infinitely reflective point&quot; (a node of instant
<br />
transmission) in the middle.
<br />
<br />People try to think of infinity in the real world as a &quot;number&quot;, but
<br />
it can't actually &quot;be&quot; a &quot;number&quot; in the traditional sense of how we
<br />
understand numbers, because a number is a an object and objects are
<br />
BOUNDED (have boundaries, have distinction) to mean something. When
<br />
mathematicians count numbers or create them in their imaginary
<br />
symbolic space, they don't always realize that we use numbers to
<br />
describe things that are for the most part could be described with
<br />
infinitely many points, it's just where we continue to stop (create a
<br />
boundary around and choose a number).  To see how this works in the
<br />
real world, imagine you're polishing a mirror for a new space
<br />
telescope do you make an object &quot;infinitely&quot; smooth, by dividing and
<br />
dividing again the measurements, or do you at some point stop and the
<br />
mirror is smooth enough?
<br />
<br />Now if you really want to see what it is like to understand infinity,
<br />
go get a hand held mirror and cover it partially with a piece of solid
<br />
or semi translucent tape that is easy to unstick from the mirror. Then
<br />
stand in front of another one like your bathroom mirror and reflect
<br />
the mirror back on itself. That is probably the best way to see the
<br />
essence of infinity: The point of infinite reflection, something that
<br />
unidirectionally reflects back on itself to a central point like a
<br />
circle spinning casting rays toward the equidistant center. Infinity
<br />
is a surprisingly easy concept to understand once you understand that
<br />
its infinitely reflective, or in simpler language  &quot;it just is&quot;.
<br />
<br />To help us understand imagine boolean conception of infinity, we must
<br />
understand by trying to imagine it in the real world the real world as
<br />
a *unidirectional* geometric series of &quot;vortex like (spinning) conic
<br />
rays towards a point in space, or a surface like your mirror, that
<br />
fades (compresses) into a point that merges.  Now back to our mirror
<br />
experiment, because all the images when you look off into that &quot;hall
<br />
of mirrors&quot; you've just created merges into an area (a completely
<br />
filled space near the &quot;Vanishing point&quot; (the point where objects lose
<br />
their boundaries and become unbounded)), all the images created from
<br />
that eternal reflection, at some point become squished together
<br />
&quot;infinitely&quot; (completely filled) where no object is distinguishable
<br />
from any other object: all objects merge and lose their boundaries!
<br />
(That is to lose distinction or boundedness)
<br />
<br />Mathematicians and scientists the symbolic terrorists
<br />
<br />Traditional mathematics obscures the concept of infinity because math
<br />
is a tool for measurement, but most mathematicians forget that math is
<br />
arbitrarily defined symbols we apply to positions on a line or surface
<br />
somewhere located in a space. We simply choose a point and then begin
<br />
counting (creating ones or subdivisions of 1) in a direction (a vector
<br />
or simply an arrow pointing in a linear direction), in school you
<br />
really only count 1's and fractions of 1 in one or two directions on
<br />
the old fashioned number line (... -2 -1 0 1 2 3 ... ), they never
<br />
teach you that you can count geometrically in 3D space, from any angle
<br />
in any direction and even many or all directions at once from
<br />
arbitrarily chosen points in a space until much later if at all if you
<br />
make it to that point educationally.
<br />
<br />The concept of one or one-ness
<br />
<br />The concept of one-ness, what is a number? Well I'll tell you what
<br />
numbers really are, they are whole or partial reflections of the
<br />
concept of one. Or, numbers are BOUNDED OBJECTS or an object that is
<br />
bounded (distinct) from something else. Why do I say this? Because all
<br />
numbers are nothing more then reflections (creations of one, fully or
<br />
partial like 1, 1/3 or 0.5 (5x0.1) or reverse reflections
<br />
(destructions (partial or total seperations) of 1), and you can
<br />
infinitely create (knit/stitch) ones together or infinitely destroy
<br />
them into infinitely many pieces. Why do I say create or destroy?
<br />
Because as you remember: Numbers are bounded objects, numbers by
<br />
definition have boundaries, and bounded objects are necessarily
<br />
finite.  Numbers are DESCRIPTIONS of OBJECTS in the real world. Be it
<br />
binary data, or the length of a wall, or the &quot;mass&quot; (how filled with
<br />
energy) of an atom.
<br />
<br />Now why do I say infinity is simply unidirectionally reflective
<br />
geometric series towards a point? Just look in the mirror, geometric
<br />
series existed before we assigned numbers to them, (1/2, 1/4, 1/16,
<br />
1/32, ...) what you see in the mirror is such a series, all you need
<br />
is two (or more) mirrors reflecting back on itself to DISCOVER certain
<br />
things that about math, and how we choose to assign decimal based
<br />
symbolic representations (1,2,3,4) to things we see like (i.e.
<br />
geometric series) which in the real world can be seen visually
<br />
(instead of in symbolic numeric notation) as we look at the two
<br />
mirrors reflecting an object or parts of objects back on themselves.
<br />
<br />Math is a symbolic subset of measurement (&quot;detecting, feeling and
<br />
sensing things&quot;)
<br />
<br />Math is really the concept and field of Measurement, and not just
<br />
measurement, measurement of shapes, colors, lights, sounds and
<br />
objects. Basically math is the measure of objects that have boundaries
<br />
and distinction. Now say we want to know how long the coastline of
<br />
Britain is, from a mathematical standpoint we'd want to fill all the
<br />
cracks and crevices along the coast with a ruler that gets smaller and
<br />
smaller and smaller, but now lets try something else. Draw a circle on
<br />
a 2D piece of paper, and measure it with a ruler... a problem starts
<br />
to occur, the more you measure, you hit a point where you keep adding
<br />
measurement nodes to the circle, or you hit a point where all your
<br />
measurements begin to merge (imagine a circle where you keep creating
<br />
dots on a growing ruler by dividing the distance again and again, over
<br />
time, and you see this circle animating, kind of like a dots traveling
<br />
around the boundary in/on a wave, as the previous scale dots keep
<br />
moving and moving.
<br />
<br />Therefore infinity is a data space, or boolean probability field, it
<br />
is not a number, the only thing infinity can be is a boundary, and an
<br />
existant.  To try to think of infinity imagine an existant white sheet
<br />
of paper with no boundaries and an ethereal bubble of 1 and zero
<br />
joined together inside the bubble flickering/vibrating, in &quot;half on&quot;
<br />
and &quot;half off&quot; state, or in a union state)... basically. the state
<br />
between zero and 1, existing in unboundedness, unidirectionally
<br />
existant. Now when we choose a number and define one, what we are
<br />
really doing is pulling strings of data (0's and 1's, ons and offs)
<br />
from an infinite (that is boolean probability field) ball of string
<br />
and making sequences, be they dots, or whatever data you want to make
<br />
and then connecting dots with lines and making shapes with them
<br />
(boundaries). It is the creation of boundaries around a chosen point.
<br />
<br />Now lets say we're god for the sake of argument and we want to build a
<br />
new universe, for my example we'll do it in 2D. We have a plane of
<br />
paper in front of us that represents the &quot;pre (always, remember
<br />
boolean, you exist or you dont), the blank sheet of paper (basically
<br />
no space-time (or rather space-matter) has been created yet).
<br />
<br />So how do we create an area? and how do we create bounded objects that
<br />
have distinction? Well first we'll try by drawing dots (nodes).  That
<br />
is by drawing binary points that we cause to exist.. So we begin to
<br />
draw a few dots around a chosen center point on our paper, in an
<br />
equidistant manner creating a concentric circle. So now we have dots,
<br />
but no boundaries,  if we tried to create something there would be no
<br />
box or space for it to exist in because we realize that SPACE is a
<br />
SOMETHING, and must be created, space is not a nothing, or a non-
<br />
existent entity.  Boolean logic demands that you either exist or you
<br />
do not.  So now what we do is we draw a boundary (a concentric circle)
<br />
around one of the dots and another concentric circle around one of the
<br />
other dots and join them  together in our minds eye. So now they form
<br />
a boolean chain.   We will fill the first ring with, energy from
<br />
existance (1), and the second with all not filled (all energy that is
<br />
the opposite, so our existing &quot;energy atom&quot;, can actually move).  So
<br />
Vaccuum in space is not nothing, it is a energy inverse, because true
<br />
energy (that which exists) can not ever stop existing (convservation
<br />
law), so the substance of space as well by definition, if ever
<br />
converted back to its proto existent atomic form, would always exist.
<br />
<br />So now we have a Uni-binary data unit that can create things (space,
<br />
matter, boundares, etc that 1) have space to exist 2) Have existence.
<br />
Now we have a boundary around an area or a &quot;space&quot;, but in the
<br />
creation of that finite space, that finite space is now connected to
<br />
&quot;unified existant energy&quot;.
<br />
<br />The easy way to understand how its connected is by simply imagining
<br />
sciences belief in the unbroken chain of cause-and-effect, if the
<br />
chain is unbroken everywhere for all time, then it must be connected
<br />
by ever present boundary (or else there would be no distinction
<br />
between objects) and that central point holding these bondaries
<br />
together must have always existed and is ever present in the
<br />
inaccessable boundaries between all things. (because in boolean, you
<br />
either exist or you do not).  And in our world, using boolean logic
<br />
there could be no unbroken chain of cause and effect, and cause and
<br />
effect breaks down completely when there are no boundaries between
<br />
objects and all energy in the universe merges back to &quot;unity&quot;, and the
<br />
dots and boundaries we have made have collapsed into the unified
<br />
always existing or what can only be called unified boolean field
<br />
space. (I call it a boolean field, simply because it makes
<br />
understanding the process in reverse easier, to a finite (bounded)
<br />
object it would be a probability field)
<br />
<br />The unity data  (the boundary that binds zero and 1, and creates the
<br />
boundary between them, or simply &quot;the indistinct existing omega-
<br />
boolean, the set that contains the boolean set&quot; (the undivided
<br />
boundary)
<br />
<br />So if infinity is &quot;unbounded&quot; (ever present, omnidirectional,
<br />
everywhere) and the finite is parts (dividing) of the existent (the
<br />
existent), then through the the binding of objects and creation of
<br />
distinction and boundaries between them must exist infinity.  You can
<br />
only have boundaries, in boolean logic (you exist or you dont) if
<br />
there is a superset that creates boundaries and distinction between
<br />
being and not being.  Through having boundaries from the one source
<br />
(which we will define as infinity) because only an &quot;unbound&quot; existent
<br />
can bind objects to create distinction between what a finite being
<br />
would perceive as 'existant' and 'not existant', the truth is when
<br />
people die their matter-energy disperses, they are not truly non-
<br />
existant since the matter that they are made of existed before they
<br />
existed, therefore, what we understand as 'non-existance' is no such
<br />
thing, it is non-consciousness of the that which exists, or the
<br />
existent.  Or the unidirectionally everywhere present boundary from
<br />
every angle that holds all energy back from wanting merging with
<br />
itself. (1 existing, energy all filling, all directional)
