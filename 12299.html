</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; I believe the answer to the question, &quot;What is Truth?&quot; which Pilate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; asked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; Jesus, was standing right in front of Pilate: Jesus himself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hmmm.... Perhaps in some symbolical way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;crux&quot; is that he is not symbolic...
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I respect your belief or faith, but I want to be frank, I have no 
<br />
evidences for the idea that &quot;Jesus&quot; is &quot;truth&quot;, nor can I be sure of 
<br />
any clear meaning such an assertion could have, or how such an 
<br />
assertion could be made scientific, even dropping Popper falsification 
<br />
criteria. I must say I have evidences on the contrary, if only the fact 
<br />
that humans succumb often to wishful thinking, and still more often to 
<br />
their parents wishful thinking.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; The Christian definition of truth goes back to the core of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everything, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; is personal.  As I've said before, without a personal core, the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;personal&quot; has lost its meaning.  In the context nowadays of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; impersonal-based philosophy, &quot;personal&quot; has come to &quot;mean&quot; something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; like &quot;without rational basis&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Of course that *is* a pity. It is bad, for human, to develop such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;self-eliminating&quot; belief.  It is not rational either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree.  cf my examples (Skinner...) in response to Stathis.  But how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do *you* define rationality and persons?
</em><br />
<br /><br />A richer lobian machine (like ZF) can define those notions with respect 
<br />
to a simpler lobian machine (like PA), and then lift the &quot;theology&quot; of 
<br />
the simpler machine to themselves (a third lobian machine or entity, 
<br />
richer than ZF, can justified such induction.
<br />
Then rationality can be defined by relative provability or 
<br />
representability in some shared theories. This leaves open the 
<br />
interpretations of those theories which ask for us implicit faith in 
<br />
our own consistency or relative correctness.
<br />
The notion of persons are defined by each hypostases (third person = 
<br />
Bp, first person = Bp &amp; p, etc.).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You also seem to reduce it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to numbers.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is a reduction only if you already defend a reductionist conception 
<br />
of numbers, and this can be considered as doubtful from the study of 
<br />
numbers, especially from the &quot;things&quot; that can emerge from their 
<br />
&quot;collective behaviors&quot; (arithmetical relations).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the sophistication of incompleteness simply hides
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that it is still a &quot;castle in the sky&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Like any falsifiable but not yet falsified theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By the &quot;direction&quot; of replacement I didn't mean chronologically, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Plato replaces Aristotle.
</em><br />
<br /><br />... in Plotinus, ok.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I meant that the impersonal core replaced
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the real personal core, independent of Aristotle's views.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You have said before that the Christians emphasize matter more than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mind, as opposed to the Platonists and neo-Platonists.  There may have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been a few Christians who reclaimed a belief in nature, like Thomas
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Aquinas, when the mind/grace was being emphasized too much.  But, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be seen in the Christian &quot;interpretation&quot; of the Greek hypostases,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the core of Christianity, being rooted in the Hebrew God who is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; source of all things/persons, is really first of all a downward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emanation, like the neo-Platonists thought.   There can be no upward
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emanation unless/until a sufficient downward emanation is provided.  In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christianity, the downward emanation is &quot;God loves us&quot;, and then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; upward emanation is &quot;We love God&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Plotinus insists a lot on the two ways: downward emanation and upward 
<br />
emanation. The lobian machine theology is coherent with this, even if 
<br />
negatively. It is coherent with Jef idea that pure &quot;theological 
<br />
imperatives&quot; can only be addressed by adapted &quot;story telling&quot; and 
<br />
examples, like jurisprudence in the application of laws. But then there 
<br />
is a proviso: none of the stories should be taken literally.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; He (the Holy Spirit) fills in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; the gaps when we cannot find words to talk to him.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Like G* minus G does for any self-referentially classical machine. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; lobian machine).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes. By the way, you said to Brent that &quot;you&quot; know that you are lobian.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How do you know?
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, sorry, I was assuming (weaker-)comp. Any machine or even larger non 
<br />
godlike entity believing in a sufficient amount of arithmetical truth 
<br />
is lobian. Actually a lobian machine, as I have define it, is just a 
<br />
universal machines knowing that she is universal (more precisely such a 
<br />
machine/entity can prove that if p is &quot;accessible by its own local 
<br />
provability ability, then she can prove that fact.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I can take this as a poetical description of the relation between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; internal modalities or the hypostases.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is not poetry.  Heidegger said to listen to the poet, not to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; content, but just to the fact that there is a poet, which gives us hope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that there is meaning.  However, unfulfilled hope does not provide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning.
</em><br />
<br />Hope is something purely first-personal, if I can say. So I have no 
<br />
clue how hope does not provide meaning. Even little (and fortunately 
<br />
locally fulfillable hope) like hope in a cup of coffee, can provide 
<br />
meaning. Bigger (and hard to express) hopes can provide genuine bigger 
<br />
meaning, it seems to me. I am not opposed to some idea of ultimate 
<br />
meaning although both personal reasons and reflection on lobianity make 
<br />
me doubt that communicating such hopes can make any sense (worse, the 
<br />
communication would most probably betrays the possible meaning of what 
<br />
is attempted to be communicated, and could even lead to the contrary).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The content of these words speak of the *actual* fulfillment
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the hopes of the Greeks expressed in their hypostases.
</em><br />
<br /><br />?   Are you talking about mystical enlightening experiences. Like 
<br />
losing any remaining doubts about immortality because you have already 
<br />
seen the whole of the eternal tergiversations all at once ?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; We have seen his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; glory, the glory of the One and Only, who came from the Father, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; full of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; grace and truth.&quot; (John 3:1,2,3,14)  So the particular finite form 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; we have, God somehow took on that same form.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; This, on the other way, could be a comp sort of blasphemes. Comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;ethic&quot; could even makes God eliminating any creature so arrogant that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; they take they their realities and images of God for granted. With
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; comp, if we are divine, we can only be divine *hypotheses*. We can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hope
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; being God last word, but this is really something which depends on our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; work and can never be taken for granted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is the ultimate irony that Jesus was taken to be blaspheming when he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; said he was &quot;one with the Father&quot; and &quot;before Abraham was, I AM&quot;, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;no one can say that they are God&quot;..... the mistake is the missing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; phrase at the end: &quot;...except God&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I mean, here, that we can agree on an important disagreement, 
<br />
making both of us quite coherent with respect to my &quot;faith&quot; in comp and 
<br />
your faith in non-comp. Here the comp theology is simpler: &quot;no one can 
<br />
say that they are God&quot;. The comp would add (inferring on G*): &quot;even, if 
<br />
not especially, (a) God&quot;. No God can assert &quot;I am (a) God&quot;,  I mean, 
<br />
not in public.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; In this way God showed us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; (who are in his image) true truth about himself in a way which we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; understand (just as a father tells truth to his children), without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; having to tell us infinite exhaustive truth.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Again this can have Plotinian sense. But there is a danger (for us
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; human) to take those assertions too much literally.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes it is a mistake to say that we understand God fully, but it would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also be a mistake (would it not?), if God were to tell us something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true (but of course not exhaustive), for us to say that we do not know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the thing that he told us.
</em><br />
<br /><br />But expressions and statements are always is need of interpretations, 
<br />
be it God's or Nature's or Colleagues' statements.
<br />
<br />As you know I am already skeptical about a &quot;physical universe&quot; if only 
<br />
because of lack of evidences (that is besides its lack of explanation 
<br />
power with comp), but then I am a realist so I do have faith in some 
<br />
accessible reality, by observation, introspection, dialog ... But term 
<br />
like &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Universe&quot; or &quot;Reality&quot; or &quot;Truth&quot; cannot been used in 
<br />
any sense presupposing that the utterer has some special connection 
<br />
with them (and this despite the most obviously probable existence of 
<br />
such connections).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  It is like (in fact IT IS) the relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between a father and a child.  (In fact, the earthly father/mother and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; child relationship is a shadow/projection of the heavenly, rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the other way around.)
</em><br />
<br /><br />How do you know? Are you willing to assume this clearly and build some 
<br />
axiomatization?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree that it is dangerous for a child to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep taking a father too literally when the father tells him/her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something.  At first, the child should take the father/mother's words
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at face value, trusting that the parent is saying the right words for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the child to understand what the parent wants them to know.  But to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; keep living with only those words, and not continue to try to learn a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deeper understanding and grow through more communication and exchange
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of love,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I feel uneasy to be loved by someone because that someone has been 
<br />
asked to love me. &quot;Love&quot; is essentially a &quot;second&quot; person construct. 
<br />
Again &quot;telling stories&quot; will go here beyond the ten thousand 
<br />
&quot;treatises&quot; . Love stories ok, love theories, why not. But normative 
<br />
love = end of love.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be to deny the true nature of what it means to be a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; person.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I recognize many important idea though, but I'm afraid that a too 
<br />
literal interpretation of many terms here could harm the principle.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Any time we stop because we think we have attained all of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; knowledge we need, that is when start to die.  I know you are saying a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar thing.
</em><br />
<br />Thanks for granting this.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I am saying that as a person, we are always able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; look at any description or approximation, for instance described by G,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and say, &quot;I am more than that&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Exactly!  This is the root of the inference of Dt.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; We are always able to change our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paradigm to a higher understanding.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Exactly. Like any lobian entity. Provably so.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is the sense that I mean when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I say that, &quot;I am not a machine.&quot;
</em><br />
<br /><br />But this is the sense in which the machine itself says: &quot;I am not a 
<br />
machine&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And this can be done only on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis of the ultimate infinite Person.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Again I agree. I would say the arithmetical hypostases describes such a 
<br />
person. In a precise theoretical frame where any one can verify the 
<br />
statements following from the axioms. Actually your &quot;ultimate inifinite 
<br />
Person&quot; is still very vague so that there are still many arithmetical 
<br />
candidates for the &quot;ultimate infinite person&quot; related to a simpler 
<br />
machine like Peano Arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; This bridges the gap
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; between the celestial/divine and the terrestial/human.  Christ is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; fixed-point between heaven and earth, the axis of the universe for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; In Christ, we all see in third-person the Way, the Truth and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Life.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Again if &quot;Christ&quot; denotes a symbolic value I can make sense of what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are saying, but in my opinion the relation between Christians and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Christ are extremely fuzzy. There has been a lasting confusion of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; power
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which makes me skeptical. Too much propositions has been deformed by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; their authoritative institutionalization. Still today &quot;theology&quot; tends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to be separated from science (i.e. from accepting doubts and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; infinite number of attempts of clarity and rigor). This separation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; resulted into the abandon of the fundamental questions to the fanatics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (who mocks clarity, rigor, and doubts).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now I am aware of the last century &quot;repentance&quot; of the Catholic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Church,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; including the necessity of restricting faith with rationality, like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; many open minded school of Muslims already warned us in the eleven
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; century, but not for a very long time).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This has been very unfortunate.  This is a result of Christians
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thinking that they understand everything about God.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  This ironically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; results in the Church turning into a (pre-Godelian in your opinion)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine.  When you think you understand everything about God, then your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; God turns into a machine and strangles you to death.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. This is almost my favorite axiom for &quot;love&quot;, &quot;heat&quot; &quot;God&quot; 
<br />
&quot;Universe&quot; :
<br />
When you think you understand everything about X, then X turns into a 
<br />
(pregodelian, total) machine and strangles you to death.
<br />
(with X = &quot;love&quot;, &quot;heat&quot; &quot;God&quot; &quot;Universe&quot;  ...)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But on the other hand, I think that our post-Godelian ignorance results
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in our being even more lost that before!
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can perhaps imagine, at least at first sight.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The fact that now we CANNOT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know, if we are a machine, which machine we are, makes us even more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lost in a sea of meaninglessness than before.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure, because we can bet. We can make act of faith. We can 
<br />
learn from our mistakes, we can change our minds and still keeping 
<br />
faith, faith corrected by reason and experiences can only grow. Only 
<br />
&quot;bad or wrong faith&quot; (generally based on wishful or fearful thinking) 
<br />
can fear to be &quot;corrected&quot;.
<br />
A bit like it is more easy for a parent to &quot;punish&quot; his child when the 
<br />
parent &quot;truly&quot;  loves it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Our hope has become even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more hopeless, not that the reductionist hope was well-founded either.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Why should our hope become more hopeless? On the contrary, knowing that 
<br />
we know less, we can expect more. With comp we can hope for more (and 
<br />
fear for more too, to be precise).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; As you say, &quot;We can hope being God last word, but this is really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something which depends on our work and can never be taken for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; granted.&quot;  I agree that we will never get God's last word (they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite), and as above it is deadly to assume we have.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; saying that we have not received ANY words from God.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />I have never said that. (Unless by God you mean this one, or this one, 
<br />
or this one, ...).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  In this case, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have absolutely NO downward emanation, it is ALL upward.
</em><br />
<br /><br />As far as the arithmetical interpretation of Plotinus hypostases are 
<br />
Plotinian, I reassure you that comp makes the &quot;emanation&quot; working in 
<br />
the two ways: up and down (or left/right in the map of the 8 
<br />
hypostases).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Arithmetic Truth&quot; is our God,
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually it can't be! It is the God of &quot;simpler lobian machine&quot; than 
<br />
us, like PA.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  there remains an *infinite* gap to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fulfill our aspirations, which will always remain unbridged.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It depends on what you mean by &quot;fulfill&quot;. Comp could be consistent with 
<br />
some complete fulfilment in some limit. It is hard to work out, and 
<br />
indeed it could be related with unpersonhood. (But the point is to take 
<br />
our theory seriously and see where we are led)
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; working from nothing, one step at a time, we will never get there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Forever Unfulfilled&quot;, there can be no true fulfillment, only through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; deceiving ourselves, which also leads to death...
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am not sure your &quot;pessimist&quot; derivation is valid. One of the 
<br />
arithmetical comp hypostase (Bp &amp; p) is both divine and personal.
<br />
We could agree on everything except for the idea that &quot;sacred text&quot; 
<br />
should not be taken literally. And we could differ on that just for the 
<br />
contingent reason we have been educated differently.
<br />
Note that I am not saying that Jesus is not the son of God, just that I 
<br />
have less evidence for that than for the *primitive* physical universe, 
<br />
in which I still don't believe either.
<br />
I know I am demanding, concerning evidence and conviction.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; P.S.  I am about to read Smullyan's &quot;Who Knows?&quot; about &quot;religious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I find it quite interesting.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry I am not yet committed to reading Forever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Undecided,
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think that Church thesis gives a bridge from &quot;Forever Undecided&quot; and 
<br />
all its technical &quot;diagonalisation/self-reference&quot; stuff to &quot;Who knows&quot; 
<br />
or &quot;Tao is silent&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  but I am halfway through Cutland's book on recursive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; functions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So the best remains, I envy you ;)
