<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Returning to your example, if God creates a person, call him A, and a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;day
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; later kills him, A will be really dead (as opposed to provisionally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dead) if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there will never be any successor OM's to his last conscious moment. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; suppose God kills A and then creates an exact copy of A along with his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; environment, call him B, on the other side of the planet. B has all of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;A's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; memories up to the moment before he was killed. This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;destruction/creation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; procedure is, except for the duplication of the environment, exactly how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; teleportation is supposed to work. I think most people on this list 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; agree that teleportation (if it could be made to work, which not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;everyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; does agree is possible) would be a method of transportation, not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;execution:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; even though the original dies, the copy has all his memories and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provides
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the requisite successor OM in exactly the same way as would have 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happened if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the original had continued living. So in the example above, if B is an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exact
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; copy of A in an exact copy of A's environment, A would &quot;become&quot; B and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; even notice that there had been any change.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure I would put it like this, although I agree that this would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probably become a common way of describing it.  But there are some aspects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the process by which A becomes B which are different from our usual,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moment-to-moment continuity of identity.  One obvious difference is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is a divine miracle.  This can hardly be neglected.  Even if we imagine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this being done technologically rather than miraculously, with A's brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being scanned and transmitted to where B will be created, the process of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;making this scan will increase the measure of that OM for A by virtue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of storing it in extra places.  This may manifest as the potential for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;future copies of A to be created starting with that exact mental moment.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;People may come to view transporting as a dangerous activity which puts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them at risk of the creation of unauthorized copies.
</em><br />
<br />Wouldn't it be relatively simple to do this sort of experiment if, in the 
<br />
far future, most people live as sentient software on a computer network?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;These are all ways in which seemingly abstract and metaphysical questions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;become manifest in the real world.  I think it is important to see that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;these are not merely imperfections in the thought experiments which we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should ignore in the interests of getting at the real issues.  In my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;model, the number of implementations is all important.  It is a major
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;determinant of measure.  Any technology which messes around with this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stuff is likely to affect the measure of the relevant observer moments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Having your mental state recorded increases its measure, which manifests
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physically as a greater chance that it can interact with the world.
</em><br />
<br />I agree that there may be good reasons why running multiple copies of an 
<br />
individual may come to be seen as desirable, the most obvious one being 
<br />
backup in case of disaster.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Now, consider the same situation with one difference. Instead of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creating B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at the instant he kills A, God creates A and B at the same time, on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;opposite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; sides of the planet but in exactly the same environment which will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;provide
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; each of them with exactly the same inputs, and their minds at all time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; remain perfectly synchronised. God allows his two creatures to live for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; day, and then instantly and painlessly kills A. In the previous example, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; agreed that the creation of B means that A doesn't really die. Now, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *exactly* the same situation when A is killed: B is there to provide the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; successor OM, and A need not even know that anything unusual had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happened.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; How could the fact that B was present a day, a minute or a microsecond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; before A's death make any difference to A? All that matters is that B is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the correct state to provide continuity of consciousness when A is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;killed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Conversely, A and A's death cannot possibly have any direct effect on B. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is not as if A's soul flies around the world and takes over B; rather, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; just so happens (because of how A and B were created) that B's mental 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;states
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; coincide with A's, or with what A's would have been if he hadn't died.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If we focus on observer-moments, there are no A and B as separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;individuals.  There are two instantiations of a set of OMs.  Each OM has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;double measure during the time that A and B exist, then it has single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure after A has been destroyed.  It is meaningless to ask, after A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dies, if B is now A or still B, or maybe both?  (I am curious to know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how you would try to answer this question, using your terminology!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Rather, there is then a single instantiation of the set of OMs.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with this; there is no way from a first person perspective that A 
<br />
and B can identify themselves as separate individuals, or perceive that 
<br />
anything has changed when one of them is terminated. I called them A and B 
<br />
for the sake of argument because I thought that is what you were implying, 
<br />
given that you have maintained that someone has died when a fraction of 
<br />
multiple instantiations of an individual are terminated. But I can see that 
<br />
this was probably presumption on my part, as you would say that the 
<br />
individual's measure was decreased due to the deaths.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Who's measure is decreased here, A's or B's? How would any of them know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; their measure had been decreased? It seems to me that neither A nor B 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *possibly* be aware that anything had happened at all. The only benefit 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; having multiple exact copies of yourself around would seem to be as 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;backup
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if one is destroyed. If your measure were surreptitiously increased or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; decreased, what symptoms would you expect to experience?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, we've been discussing this all along, and I have tried to answer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it several times, but I can only do so by analogy.  Having your measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decreased is like having a chance of dying.  Having it increased is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;like... well, I can't analogize it to anything, because it has never been
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible and we have no experience of it.  Only if technology advances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to allow mental copies will it be possible for us to increase measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What will it be like?  It will be like gaining greater influence over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the world, greater ability to put our plans into fruition (just as death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;represents a loss of those abilities).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; What about if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; were a piece of sentient software: surely having multiple instantiations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the ones and zeroes could not make any difference; if it did, wouldn't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be a bit like expecting that your money would have greater purchasing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;power
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; if your bank backed up their data multiple times? Or like saying that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;2+2=4&quot; would be more vividly true (or whatever it is that increasing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; measure causes to happen) if lots and lots of people held hands and did 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; calculation simultaneously?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think those are accurate analogies.  Your money would not have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;multiple purchasing power if it were backed up multiple times, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that information would have greater measure.  Measure is a property of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information.  When the information about your money has greater measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this will tend to give it greater robustness and more opportunity to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interact with and influence the world.  Specifically, it can't be deleted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and lost as easily.  Multiple backups have real value and any legitimate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bank will make sure to use them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I can't be completely sure that increasing your measure would have no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; effect. Maybe there would be some sort of telepathic communication 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the various copies, such as is said to occur between identical twins, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; some as yet undiscovered physical phenomenon. However, there is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;absolutely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no evidence at present for such a thing, and I think that until such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evidence is found, we should only go on what we know to be true and what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; logically be deduced from it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;No, I have absolutely no expectation of any such nonphysical effects from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;increasing measure.  I am confident that we agree about the third-party
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;effects of making copies.  No copy will demonstrate that he is able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;read the minds of his fellows.  I can only say that increasing measure is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the opposite of decreasing measure, that our measure decreases every day,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that we fight as hard as we can to keep it from decreasing faster.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I believe that you view this fight as a philosophical mistake, but your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;genes don't agree!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Your genes are not content to have just one copy.  A gene doesn't say,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it doesn't matter how many of me there are, as long as at least one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exists I am still alive.  No, each gene fights its hardest to increase
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;its measure.  It wants to occupy as much of the universe as it can.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It wants to increase its influence, its redundancy, its robustness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is what increasing measure means to your genes.  If people lived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a regime where increasing measure were possible, I believe they would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;come to adopt similar views, and for the same reason our genes did.
</em><br />
<br />I would agree that increasing your measure makes you more robust in the same 
<br />
way that backing up information makes it less likely that the last remaining 
<br />
copy of the information (and hence, the information itself) will be 
<br />
destroyed. I agree that it might also help you achieve your goals faster, 
<br />
although here we are deviating a little from the initial argument about 
<br />
exact copies running in parallel (if you asked your copy to help you dig a 
<br />
hole, running in parallel wouldn't be a good idea). I can also see how 
<br />
people, for these reasons, might conclude it would be a good idea to have as 
<br />
many copies extant as possible, and to protect them from coming to harm. But 
<br />
to clarify that this is all you meant, would you agree that a person would 
<br />
have no way of knowing if his measure were suddenly increased or decreased, 
<br />
provided that he didn't suddenly drop dead? And why would it be a bad thing 
<br />
to increase a person's measure and then some time later return it to what it 
<br />
was, given that it won't affect him in any way other than to temporarily 
<br />
decrease the probability that he will drop dead?
