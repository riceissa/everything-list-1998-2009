Physicist Max Tegmark has an interesting discussion on the
<br />
physics of a universe with more than one time dimension at
<br />
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.html">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.html</a> , specifically
<br />
<a href="http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.pdf">http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.pdf</a> .  In the excerpts
<br />
below, n is the number of space dimensions and m the number of time
<br />
dimensions, so when he writes m &gt; 1 he means more than one time dimension.
<br />
Quoting Tegmark:
<br />
<br />: What would reality appear like to an observer in a manifold with more
<br />
: than one time-like dimension? Even when m &gt; 1, there is no obvious
<br />
: reason why an observer could not, none the less, perceive time as being
<br />
: one-dimensional, thereby maintaining the pattern of having &quot;thoughts&quot;
<br />
: in a one-dimensional succession that characterizes our own reality
<br />
: perception. If the observer is a localized object, it will travel along
<br />
: an essentially one-dimensional (time-like) world line through the (n +
<br />
: m)-dimensional spacetime manifold. The standard general relativity notion
<br />
: of its proper time is perfectly well defined, and we would expect this
<br />
: to be the time that it would measure if it had a clock and that it would
<br />
: subjectively experience.
<br />
:
<br />
: Needless to say, many aspects of the world would none the less appear
<br />
: quite different.  For instance, a re-derivation of relativistic mechanics
<br />
: for this more general case shows that energy now becomes an m-dimensional
<br />
: vector rather than a constant, whose direction determines in which
<br />
: of the many time directions the world line will continue, and in the
<br />
: non-relativistic limit, this direction is a constant of motion. In
<br />
: other words, if two non-relativistic observers that are moving in
<br />
: different time directions happen to meet at a point in spacetime, they
<br />
: will inevitably drift apart in separate time directions again, unable
<br />
: to stay together.
<br />
:
<br />
: Another interesting difference, which can be shown by an elegant
<br />
: geometrical argument [10], is that particles become less stable when m
<br />
: &gt; 1....
<br />
:
<br />
: In addition to these two differences, one can concoct seemingly strange
<br />
: occurrences involving &quot;backward causation&quot; when m &gt; 1. None the less,
<br />
: although such unfamiliar behaviour may appear disturbing, it would seem
<br />
: unwarranted to assume that it would prevent any form of observer from
<br />
: existing. After all, we must avoid the fallacy of assuming that the
<br />
: design of our human bodies is the only one that allows self-awareness....
<br />
:
<br />
: There is, however, an additional problem for observers when m &gt; 1,
<br />
: which has not been previously emphasized even though the mathematical
<br />
: results on which it is based are well known. If an observer is to be
<br />
: able to make any use of its self-awareness and information-processing
<br />
: abilities, the laws of physics must be such that it can make at least
<br />
: some predictions. Specifically, within the framework of a field theory,
<br />
: it should, by measuring various nearby field values, be able to compute
<br />
: field values at some more distant spacetime points (ones lying along its
<br />
: future world line being particularly useful) with non-infinite error
<br />
: bars. If this type of well-posed causality were absent, then not only
<br />
: would there be no reason for observers to be self-aware, but it would
<br />
: appear highly unlikely that information processing systems (such as
<br />
: computers and brains) could exist at all.
<br />
<br />Tegmark then goes into quite a technical discussion about solving the
<br />
equations of physics given various ways of specifying initial values,
<br />
the upshot of which is that if m &gt; 1 (i.e. more than one time dimension)
<br />
observers would not be able to predict the state in the rest of the
<br />
universe from their observations, which would seem to preclude the
<br />
existence of observers.  I'm not sure I fully understood this argument.
<br />
<br />However the earlier part is quite instructive in giving us a picture of
<br />
how a universe could look that had multiple time dimensions.  Any one
<br />
entity would still have a single time line, but different ones might
<br />
disagree about which direction the future was, and time loops would
<br />
be possible.  Personally I think this is a more serious problem than
<br />
Tegmark's idea about prediction difficulties, although he seems to gloss
<br />
over it as mere unfamiliar behavior.
<br />
<br />Nevertheless I think it is instructive to realize that multiple time
<br />
dimension universes are a conceptual possibility even if they are unlikely
<br />
to contain observers like us.  Tegmark is implicitly writing within the
<br />
block universe perspective which is generally adopted by physicists.
<br />
Translating this into a &quot;flow of time&quot; view seems quite challenging
<br />
and suggests that that viewpoint may not be as flexible in terms of
<br />
deep understanding of the notion of time.
