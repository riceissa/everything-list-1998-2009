Basically []p = provable p in such a precise way that

<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; BM: Here I gave a little sketch of the translation of UDA in a &quot;consistent

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I hope that you realize that there are many ideas that you are assuming

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tacitly that I and others are not familiar with and/or may have other

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;definitions for.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I constantly refer the interested lister to Boolos 1993 book. Or 
<br />
Smorynski 1985.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;For example: exactly what do the words &quot;consistent&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;machine&quot; and &quot;language&quot; mean?
</em><br />
<br />BM: See above.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I take &quot;consistent&quot; means that given some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;formal model, whose exact definition must be given somehow ...
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Any machine or theory extending classical logic and capable of
<br />
proving elementary arithmetical theorems.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;... or, at least,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;must be familiar to your readers, a &quot;consistent machine's language&quot; is one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;where there is no contradiction obtainable given any possible combination of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the machine's language.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Not &quot;any possible combination&quot;, only those who respect classical logical
<br />
inference rule. I interview (in AUDA) the platonist computationalist machine!
<br />
<br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     We may note that &quot;machines&quot; are usually defined by some set of functions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;N -&gt; N, where N are the Natural numbers.
</em><br />
<br />BM: Read my to diagonalisation post for making this precise. I would say that
<br />
controlable machine, constructive reals, and total computable function (where
<br />
total means defined on all N, can be, in our context, identified. But
<br />
such a set is not *recursively* (mechanically) enumerable!!!!
<br />
All &quot;my&quot; enterprise, and actually Church thesis, are made consistent by the
<br />
fact that the set of total computable function is a necessarily fuzzy set
<br />
include in the set of all computable functions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am very skeptical that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(countable) set of numbers alone is sufficient in itself to cover the range
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of all possible systems in Nature (the Totality of possible existential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expressions, including all mathematics). Given this caveat, is this within
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your notion of a definition of these words?
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Please read carefully the diagonalisation post. Church thesis is really the
<br />
&quot;schroedinger equation&quot; of comp. I mean a highly non trivial statement in the
<br />
fundamentals of mathematics. It is the roots of the incompleteness phenomenon.
<br />
Before Church thesis you could have believed that &quot;to be a machine&quot; is a
<br />
simplifying assumption. After Church thesis we know that machines, 
<br />
and universal
<br />
machines in particular&quot; have unbounded complexity. Universal machines are
<br />
mostly lucky unpredictable being.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt;SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;     Ok, I am not questioning whether or not there &quot;exists&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-referential
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;programs (plural???) or a &quot;Univiversal program&quot; (singular???), I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;wondering about how do we go from formal existence postulation to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;possibility of &quot;maniferstation&quot; itself. This is where I think that there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;a problem if only in that the domain of explanatory power of such models
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;only applies to a very narrow range.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I am really afraid you don't take Church thesis into account. The explanatory
<br />
power applies to range which you can not even bound by formal tools.
<br />
Even the whole Cantor Paradise is too poor to explain *in general* universal
<br />
machine behavior.
<br />
Some people still believe that the computer industry will make our life
<br />
more simple. They will be disillusioned. A good thing perhaps.
<br />
Now, for an explanation of the qualitative aspect of the &quot;manifestation&quot;,
<br />
well this is all the purpose of my thesis. Note that I acknowledge an
<br />
explanatory gap, but I show that comp justifies the existence of a talk
<br />
on explanatory gap by the machine's first person.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; BM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Not with comp by hypothesis. Manifestation are indexicals. Strictly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;speaking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  this follows from the UDA + OCCAM RAZOR, or better UDA + MOVIE GRAPH.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  (we can come back on this latter). See Maudlin 89 for something equivalent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  to the movie graph. Maudlin realises the incompatibility between the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  &quot;physical supervenience thesis&quot; (sup-phys) and comp. Because he want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  sup-phys, he abandons comp. Because I postulate comp, I abandon sup-phys.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     What I am trying to argue is that we can not abondon eiter sup-phys nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comp except in the very very special case where the distinguishability
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between the two vanishes, e.g. a neutal monism that obtains in the infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limit of all possible existential (or ontological) expressions and,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;additionally, we must not be so cavalier in our postulations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     As I have tried to argue before, the notion that the mind is UTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emulable is not a proven fact and at this point should be considered to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;merely a conjecture.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
It cannot be taken as a conjecture. It is an hypothesis which has the
<br />
curious feature that if you add it as an axioms it becomes false!
<br />
(This is a known feature of modal logics or intensional mathematics).
<br />
So &quot;the notion that the mind is [consistently] UTM emulable&quot; is not only
<br />
not a proven fact, but it will never be a proven fact, even in the
<br />
seemingly trivial sense as being provable in a theory which take it as
<br />
axioms. I use modal logic because it is so easy to be wrong in intensional
<br />
(modal) context.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The thought experiement using classical cloning and or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;teleporting of minds has several assumptions that are contrary to known
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physical facts, such as the imposibility of simulataneously measuring the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;position and momenta of all the required atoms of a brain such that a UTM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;could be defined that would emulate its behaviour. This, in itself, leads me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to reject the entire notion of &quot;brain cloning&quot; and any idea that depends on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it as simple idealistic. It is as fantastic as a pink unicorn. I see not way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in which the classical teleportation is possible in the &quot;real world&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I use brain cloning (and the neuro hypothesis) to make my argument
<br />
simpler. Then I explicitely eliminate that hypothesis.
<br />
The elimination is based on the fact that the UD will generate all
<br />
your digital quantum state.
<br />
You can postulate that you are not a quantum digital machine, for example
<br />
that you are some analogical quantum machine capable
<br />
of handling in finite time infinite precision. But in that case you are no
<br />
more in the context of the comp hypothesis. I have no problem with that.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Nice. I didn't see it!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;  Exactly what is the formal statement of &quot;if she looks closely enough to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;its probable local implementation&quot; or equivalently, &quot;near its comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;substitution level&quot;? Are you assuming some kind of &quot;delta-epsilonics&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  BM:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  It means that your substitution level are the neurons and you look at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  the molecules which constitute the neurons. Or your substitution level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  is the quarks and you look at anything apparently making up the quarks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  It happens when  you look at a so much fine grain that you face the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  undistinguishable stories. I am not assuming &quot;delta-epsilonics&quot; things,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  it is an open problem if sort of &quot;delta-epsilonics&quot;  is not dormant here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  CF: the UD dovetails on the reals, oracles, ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Umm, this confuses me! How can we think of UD as &quot;generating&quot; all of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physicality via computational simulations but yet seems to require the prior
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existence of the reals (numbers), oracles, etc. This looks like a &quot;chicken
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the egg&quot; problem!
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
You always seem to forget that I don't postulate any form of physicality.
<br />
For me term like &quot;matter&quot; or &quot;universe&quot; are like the term &quot;phlogistic&quot; or
<br />
&quot;God&quot;. That is very, very, very, ..., very vague term which confuses us on
<br />
fundamental questions. Those term have local use but we will not progress
<br />
if we reify them and take their referent for granted. It would be like to
<br />
finally criticize a molecular biologist because he has not yet explain the
<br />
vital principle.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;  &gt; &gt;SPK:

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Please

<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt;point me to the definitions again. ;-)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     This is just more on the classical teleportation idea that I am arguing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is impossible in the real world!
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
That impossibility is not relevant for the demonstration. I insist. See

above.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Again, you can not do this &quot;postulating&quot; and make ontological claims.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is not like Euclid's postulation of points! But furthermore, why do you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not postulate more than just N-&gt; N and arithmatic operations? It seems to me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that Goedel's incompleteness theorems necessitate and infinite nesting of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;metatheories to span the universe of mathematics such that a Totality of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;mathemacial universe&quot; is not even enumerable!
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
You are right. But Godel's theorems are provable by the machines, and that
<br />
is the reason why I don't need to postulate explicitily those tranfinite
<br />
progressions. Numbers in numberland also dream about infinite nestings of
<br />
metatheories. There is a sort of SKOLEM paradox here. I postulate just the
<br />
meaningfulness of the standard model of &quot;Peano Arithmetics&quot; (let us say),
<br />
and then I show that this countable model, seen from inside (1-view), is
<br />
bigger than what any machines can ever imagine, and is highly structured too.
<br />
That 1-bigness will provide jobs for mathematical psychologists, for ... ever.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     As a matter of fact, I have no way to prove that you are not a machine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and you can not prove that this post is not just the output of a random
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;letter generator. All we have is likelyhoods and assumptions. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Sure.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SPK: I fail to see how notions such as &quot;time&quot;, &quot; casuality&quot; and &quot;1-person /
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3-person distinctions are shown to be necessary by your model. My point is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that if our 1-person experience of a world is nothing more that a string of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;symbols existing a priori in Platonia,
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
But it is not! A first person is a person with her feelings, pains, hopes,
<br />
joys, headache, and many personal memories. Nothing else. Certainly not
<br />
a 3-string, not a 3-bunch of 3-particles, not a 3-machine, neither a 3-brain.
<br />
The magic of comp, is that you can 3-study the 1-person discourse.
<br />
The 1-person are much more than the arithmetical platonia, even if that
<br />
much more is just platonia seen from inside.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;why do we have enless debates about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the notion of a &quot;flow of consciousness&quot;? It can not be &quot;explained&quot; away as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just an illusion or &quot;intensional stance&quot;. Immaterial strings might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;capable of encoding each other as subsets but unless we have some means to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explain how Nature solves mathematical problems that are both intractible by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;finite TMs and require that we include the means of explaining concurrent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computations, e.g. we have to explain, at least, the appearence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;interactions between a plurality of systems not just a single computational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system.
</em><br />
<br />BM: That's exactly what I begin to do in my thesis.
<br />
<br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I am sorry, Bruno. But unless you can recover your proof independent of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;classical teleportation&quot; your explanation is grossly insufficient, at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least, for me. :_(
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Read very carefully the UDA, and you will see that I explicitely eliminate
<br />
the &quot;classical teleportation&quot;. It is the point 13 in the m1726.
<br />
<br /><br />SPK:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Our ideas seems to be very similar but I think that you have truncated a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lot of ideas into COMP that need to be more carefully examined. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possibility that we need to define a generalization for COMP that involves,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at least C -&gt; C functions (C = complex numbers) obtains in my thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Pratt's notion of Chu spaces with k = Complex seems to get close.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     I am working on a post on Pratt's ideas but have many distractions and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so do not know when it will be ready to post.
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
Take your time. I am busy too. Apparently, also, my computer is again sick
<br />
(damned).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;SPK:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Let us continue our explorations of ideas and I hope to explain to you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;how I am neither a PHYSICAList nor a COMPutationalist. I have a thought that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;might show how there might be a flaw in your reasoning and it is that just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;because UTMs are independent of any particular physical implementation does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not obtain that UTMs do not require, at least, some approximate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implementation in physicality. Numbers are meaningless if there does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exist some 1-person notion of &quot;numberness&quot;. Like the number three is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaningless symbol, at best, if there is not some set of objects that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;associable with &quot;threeness&quot;. More on this in the next post. ;-)
</em><br />
<br />BM:
<br />
I am not sure there is any problem between us. You don't like very much
<br />
neither comp, nor what I derive from it. People who postulates comp and
<br />
who does not like the consequence are more troubled, like most
<br />
monist materialist.
<br />
I have skip the &quot;Finkelstein part of the post&quot; because I prefer to reread
<br />
him before). I am a little less finitist than Finkelstein, I think).
<br />
Apology also for having (non purposefully) attribute some of my prose
<br />
to you ;-).
<br />
<br />Bruno
