Hi Wei,
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm not sure I do understand it. Do you think the &quot;measure of comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeterminacy&quot; is relevant in decision theory? Before you answer that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;question, please read the book _Foundations of Causal Decision Theory_
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that I recommended earlier so you can understand what it is that I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;asking. If the answer is yes, then please explain how it can be used in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;decision theory. If the answer is no, then I believe the &quot;lemma&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;meaningless.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK I will try to read Joyce's book asap. In general I am quite skeptic
<br />
about the use of the notion of &quot;causality&quot;. I have also no understanding
<br />
of your posts in which you argue about a relationship between the search
<br />
of a TOE and decision theory.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Perhaps the trouble is that you are not really aware of the mind-body
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  problem?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm aware of *a* mind-body problem. I'm not sure if it's the same one you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have in mind. The one I have in mind is this: how do I derive a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probability distribution for the (absolute) SSA from a third-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;description of the multiverse?
</em><br />
<br />The mind-body problem I am talking about is the one formulated by Descartes
<br />
(but also by Hindu philosophers before J.C). It is really the problem
<br />
of linking private (first person) sensations and third person communicable
<br />
phenomena. How a grey brain produces sensation of color, as someone put it.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; This is where the list splits in two. Those aware of a measure problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  and the other ... It is linked to our all debate between RSSA and ASSA
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  (Relative Self-Sampling Assumption/Absolute SSA).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I guess we're going in circles a little bit, except I now have a better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understanding of how decision theory would work given the absolute SSA. (I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still have to write down my thoughts on this matter.) But I still do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;see how it could work with the RSSA.
</em><br />
<br />Remember that I have argue the RSSA is not an option but follows from the
<br />
comp hypothesis in the cognitive science.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Because we want to understand the nature of reality and where does it comes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  from.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think we can do that without first-person indeterminancy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Not with comp, imo. We *face* 1-person indeterminacy. we just cannot throw it
<br />
out.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Consciousness is part of the data we must explain,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's still a hard problem (i.e. we have no theory of consciousness) but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't see how first-person indeterminancy helps.
</em><br />
<br /><br />It is not intended to help us. It is part of the computationalist formulation
<br />
of the problem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think that's fairly easy, at least conceptually. It's &quot;just&quot; a matter of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;showing that almost all observer-moments are experiencing or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remembering lawful phenomena. Again, I think that can be done without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first-person indeterminancy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Same remark.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; With comp the laws emerge from the relation between numbers, but as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  seen from inside, so that I don't see how to avoid the modal distinctions in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  a search toward a toe. I think you fail to appreciate the &quot;proof&quot; character
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  of the uda.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What axioms are you assuming for the proof?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Those I have encapsulated in the label &quot;comp&quot;. Precisely it consists in
<br />
1)accepting a minimal amount of arithmetical realism, i.e. the truth of
<br />
elementary statements of arithmetic does not depend of me or us ...
<br />
2) the Church Thesis (also called the Church Turing Thesis, or the 
<br />
Post Law, etc.)
<br />
i.e. all universal machine are equivalent with respect to their simulation
<br />
abilities (making abstraction of the duration of those simulation).
<br />
3) The existence of a level of description of my body (whatever it 
<br />
is) such that
<br />
my first person experience remains invariant through a functional substitution
<br />
made at that level.
<br />
<br />(Note that the Arithmetical uda makes it possible to eliminate the &quot;3)&quot; above).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  I'm not sure you are not a sound machine especially when proving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  things on numbers. In the worst case take my &quot;restriction&quot; as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  simplifying assumption. But I don't think there is any restriction here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  The amazing fact is that the sound machine has (through the Z logics) an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  amazingly large non-monotonical layer. Remember that &quot;inconsistency&quot; has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; been shown consistent in Peano Arithmetic, ZF theory, etc. Sound machines,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  sound at the basic level I interrogate them, can be consistently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;very unsound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  once entangled to deep computational histories. I am taking the full nuance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  given by the second incompleteness theorem into account here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Unfortunately I don't understand much of what you say in this paragraph,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;especially these two sentences:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Remember that &quot;inconsistency&quot; has  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  been shown consistent in Peano Arithmetic, ZF theory, etc. Sound machines,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  sound at the basic level I interrogate them, can be consistently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;very unsound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  once entangled to deep computational histories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The first sentence obviously refers to some result from metamathematics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but you have to remember that I'm still learning about it and be more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;explicit (at least use a standard name to refer to the result so I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;look it up).
</em><br />
<br /><br />I was referring to the second incompleteness theorem by Godel: a consistent
<br />
machine cannot prove its own consistency. This means that if you add the
<br />
inconsistency as a new axiom the machine will not derive a contradiction,
<br />
(because if the machine derive a contradiction from her inconsistency, she
<br />
will prove its consistency by reductio ad absurdo). So a consistent machine
<br />
will not be inconsistent when she asserts its own inconsistency.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I have no idea what the second sentence means.
</em><br />
<br />OK. It is not clear and not really relevant.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; You would be really unsound, through my basic use of the term, only if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  were able to give a finite proof of a false proposition, not just pretend
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  you could find it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Of course I can give a finite proof of a false proposition. I just have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;use an unsound logic to do the proof. If you restrict us to using sound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logics, then nobody can give a finite proof of a false proposition, so if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that's your definition of sound machine, I'm not sure what the point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;qualifying &quot;machine&quot; with &quot;sound&quot; is.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Of course I restrict us and the machines I interview to sound logics. Why
<br />
should I interview unsound machines? It would be like an historian working on
<br />
a biography of Napoleon, and interviewing a mad guy in an asylum pretending
<br />
to be Napoleon. I limit my interview to sound machine for the same reason
<br />
I would stop reading papers by someone if I realize
<br />
he is using (systematically) a theory which is unsound.
<br />
Except for clinical case I have never find someone using unsound 
<br />
basic theories.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;  &gt; Because with comp the relation between our first person inspired decisions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  and third person (or first person plural) realities remains to be explained.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  The comp indeterminacy, by the invariance lemma, pertains on the whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  of UD* (the computationalist form of everything).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  Of course you can forget comp, postulate a reality (defined by what you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  see and expect to see) and take your decisions. But we are looking for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  a toe, not a recipe for life. You don't need quantum gravity for everyday
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  decision do you? But you can imagine quantum gravity being related to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  search of a TOE, ok? Well, what I try to say is that if you take seriously
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  the hypothesis that our private experience are invariant for functional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  substitution at some level, then the utimate explanation of quantum gravity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  is accessible by UTMS pure introspection, and that the toe is a mixture
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  of machine's machine psychology (G), and machine psychology (G*).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  The advantage of my way is that it gives an explanation for the origin
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  of physical laws and at the same time of physical sensations. It 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;has no direct
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  use in decision theory, except perhaps by predicting new phenomena, perhaps
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  exploitable, like any new theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  No doubt I make simplifications here and there, but what remains is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  very complex and unknown. I would be glad if someone find a flaw or some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;  implicit hypothesis I use unconsciously ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would be happy to try to find some flaw or implicit hypothesis in your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument, but I'm still waiting for the English paper you've promised us.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;:( Until then I'm just trying to understand your explicit assumptions and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conclusions.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Fair enough. It is discussion like this one which could make higher the
<br />
probability that I write that paper.
<br />
<br />[snip]
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't have to explain how I &quot;keep being in the same computation&quot; because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't know or claim that. I'm not sure that's even a meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sentence.
</em><br />
<br />It seems to me you claim it in your next sentence, here:
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;All I do claim is that for any given computation, if I am in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that computation, I care about the future version of me in that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation, and I can causally affect its future (and only its future).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In other words, the causal influence of my actions stay in the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computation.
</em><br />
<br /><br />The whole point of the uda thought experiment consists in showing that
<br />
expressions like &quot;I am in that computation&quot; are not well defined. The uda shows
<br />
also that we have a lot of futures (&quot;future, btw, is a first person construct:
<br />
there is no notion of future in any &quot;block-reality&quot; approach).
<br />
The fact that  &quot;I can causally affect its future&quot; is not clear at all,
<br />
and any clearer version should be justified.
<br />
Let me give you a simple example.
<br />
Suppose you decide to drink a cup of coffee.
<br />
You will prepare that cup of coffee hoping this will causally affect &quot;its
<br />
(yours!) future, in a way such that you make the first person experience
<br />
of drinking that cup of coffee.
<br />
But the UD, because he is shallow, will generate an infinite number of
<br />
computations in which you will experience drinking a cup of tea (if 
<br />
not a white rabbit), and this although you have the same experience 
<br />
of the past which include
<br />
your preparing that cup of coffee).
<br />
The &quot;invariance lemma&quot;  prevents &quot;easy&quot; use of (Kolmogorov or 
<br />
Chaitin) complexity
<br />
notion for dismissing those abnormal stories.
<br />
The comp indeterminacy hints to transform that problem into a search 
<br />
of a measure,
<br />
and into showing that relatively abnormal consistent 
<br />
extension/stories are rare.
<br />
This is not unlike the Feynman integration on path in quantum mechanics.
<br />
<br />Bruno
