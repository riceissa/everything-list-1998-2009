<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Stathis [from the other posting again]: 'There is good reason to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; believe that the third person observable behaviour of the brain can be

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; emulated, because the brain is just chemical reactions and chemistry is a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; well-understood field.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; MP: Once again it depends what you mean. Does 'Third person observable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; behaviour of the brain' include EEG recordings and the output of MRI
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; imaging? Or do you mean just the movements of muscles which is the main
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; indicator of brain activity? If the former then I think that would be very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; hard, perhaps impossible; if the latter however, that just might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; achievable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Huh? I think it would be a relatively trivial matter to emulate MRI and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; EEG data, certainly compared to emulating behaviour as evidenced by muscle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity (complex, intelligent behaviour such as doing science or writing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; novels is after all just muscle activity, which is just chemical reactions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the muscles triggered by chemical reactions in the brain). &quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: 'relatively trivial'? I think perhaps you underestimate what it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; involved; '... the brain is just chemical reactions, and chemistry is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well-understood field' reinforces this view. My point is that it is NOT just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical reactions, but chemical reactions which take place in embodiment of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple overlapping, inter-penetrating and self-organising hierarchies of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic structures. I think that various avenues of research are showing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that a key feature of brain functioning which 'binds' together the 'just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chemical' activities of multiple brain regions at any given moment and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneously at multiple scales of size, intensity and frequencies, is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; harmonic resonance and interference patterns generated by wave forms which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are made up of the combined actions of billions of neurons propagating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thousands of impulses per second to form dynamic interaction patterns.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />How could it not be chemical reactions? The fact that they are large and
<br />
complex macromolecules with some very complex physical chemistry involved
<br />
does not mean it's not chemistry, and neither does the fact that it is
<br />
easier to look at the emergent behaviour of the brain as a whole. If all the
<br />
relevant chemical reactions occur in the right order and the right
<br />
configuration, that is necessary and sufficient for a functioning brain.
<br />
<br />I think the only way to truly grasp the scope of what is occurring is
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through visual imagination but linking one's ideas also to the experience of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; musical polyphony and rhythms. The trick is to 'see' in the mind's eye that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the *effective* structures which make things happen and which constitute our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiences are in fact the wave patterns composed of swarms [or flocks,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; herds, shoals, clouds] of depolarisations. The neurons, ganglia, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whatever other 'physical' structural features you like to think about, are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; WHERE the dynamic interaction structures take place. Much work has been done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to show that synapses vary in a metastable way in response to how they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; used by the interaction patterns in which they participate, as also do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dendrites which may move, extend, contract or die off in response to how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they are used. The figurative nature of these patterns is embodied in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiple, distributed locations in which most of their activity takes place
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and also in the characteristic temporal consistency of interaction between
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the spatially discrete or contiguous but contrastive locations. Furthermore
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seems very likely, if not yet certain, that many synergistic effects will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be occurring such as the occurrence of electric fields oscillating in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directions orthogonal to the propagation of impulses.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />Sure, but it's still just chemical reactions underlying all this.
<br />
<br />MRI scans may be very good for pinpointing the topological features of this
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dynamic activity but not so the temporal details. On the other hand EEG
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; records can give much better detail for some temporal features but the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; spatial resolution is very course and confined to areas near the skull. New
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; techniques using laser beams passed through parts of the brain are capable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of giving millisecond resolution to some events occurring deeper within. So
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also can very thin electrodes which report events within or near individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neurons, but here the problem is the limit to how many needles are allowed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be inserted into a human cortical pin cushion: not many! One day though
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone is going to develop a kind of nanobot which can migrate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unobtrusively through brain tissue and broadcast radio pulses describing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activity of neurons near by as well as key features of electric fields and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other ambient conditions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />OK, but I thought you said that MRI and EEG data is difficult to emulate,
<br />
which it is not.
<br />
<br />Stathis:'As for scientific research, I never managed to understand why Colin
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thought this was more than just a version of the Turing test. '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: I think the key point is that successful basic science involves a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; degree of spontaneous creativity that is not merely an algorithmic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; implementation of rules, as opposed to, say, a competent chess-playing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program or a merely classificatory program. It involves the construction of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a new way of looking at the world, and then the testing of predictions which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arise from the construct. In passing I would say this also is a key test for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defining what is a REAL world. I tend to think that a Matrix of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eponymous Hollywood movie type, would suffer from being a Zenoverse: the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resolution of time and space would be so lumpy as to REQUIRE a belief in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; designer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />The idea of the Turing test is that &quot;an algorithmic implementation of rules&quot;
<br />
will give the required &quot;degree of spontaneous creativity&quot;. If you don't
<br />
believe in this, then you don't even believe in weak AI, let alone strong AI
<br />
or computationalism. That is not a common position among scientists and
<br />
philosophers of mind; even John - anticomputationalism - Searle agrees that
<br />
the laws of physics necessitate that human-indistinguishable AI should be
<br />
theoretically possible. Roger Penrose, and Colin, are very much in the
<br />
minority.
<br />
<br />Stathis: 'I can meaningfully talk about &quot;seeing red&quot; to a blind person who
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has no idea what the experience is like ... '
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MP: OK, but can he or she meaningfully understand you?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />They can understand many things about sight without actually understanding
<br />
what it is like to have it, just as we can understand many things about a
<br />
bat's sonar, in many ways much more than the bat understands. But that part
<br />
of vision or bat sonar which cannot be understood unless the observer has it
<br />
himself, no matter how good the collected empirical data, is what is meant
<br />
by first person experience.
