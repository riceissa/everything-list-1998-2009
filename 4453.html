Russell Standish refers to his earlier post,
<br />
<a href="http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m781.html">http://www.escribe.com/science/theory/m781.html</a> and now writes:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Noone that I could recall came up with a convincing argument against
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Euthanasia issue - it would seem that committing euthanasia on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone is actually condemning them to an eternity of even greater
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; misery than if you'd just left things alone - quite the contrary to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what one expects in a single universe notion of reality.
</em><br />
<br />The problem Russell points out is that in the MWI if we try to kill
<br />
someone, we will succeed in many branches, but fail in some others.
<br />
And in those in which we fail, we will probably injure the victim.
<br />
The effect from the point of view of the continuations of the victim is
<br />
that their quality of life has been worsened.
<br />
<br />I think a counter-argument comes if we look at the larger picture, not
<br />
just the particular branch in which we are acting.  Suppose that the
<br />
victim has suffered some injury which led to their unfortunate condition,
<br />
where we are now considering committing euthanasia.  In other branches,
<br />
then, the victim is alive and healthy.  If we eliminate them from most
<br />
of the branches in which they are injured, then in the big picture their
<br />
average quality of life has been improved.  Even though there are a few
<br />
branches where our attempts to kill them have failed and have made their
<br />
life worse, those are small in proportion to the set of branches which
<br />
encompass their entire life.
<br />
<br />Now it may be said that this perspective is invalid, because the
<br />
injured person here in front of us is the only one we can affect.
<br />
His consciousness will never re-join the branches where he was not
<br />
injured.  We can only affect him, and therefore we should judge our
<br />
actions only based on their effects on him and his future continuations.
<br />
<br />However, if we step back and consider things before the injury which
<br />
caused him harm, he might have said at the time, if I am injured, please
<br />
arrange to have me killed ASAP.  (In fact, people often do this even if
<br />
they believe in a single universe, via &quot;living will&quot; documents.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From his perspective, both the injured and non-injured versions are
</em><br />
in his future.  He can choose to manipulate the probabilities so that
<br />
the greater part of his future experiences are in positive rather than
<br />
negative conditions.  In effect, that is exactly what all decisions
<br />
consist of in the MWI - manipulations of probabilites and measure so as
<br />
to maximize the weight of the positive outcomes.  From that perspective,
<br />
I think it is reasonable to choose to have oneself euthanized in case of
<br />
negative outcomes, so that the average quality of all future experiences
<br />
is improved.
<br />
<br />Another angle on this argument takes an even broader view.  Let us
<br />
consider all observer-moments in the multiverse.  By eliminating those
<br />
observer-moments which have a negative quality of life, we improve
<br />
the average quality of all observer-moments and therefore we make the
<br />
multiverse a better place to live.  This is the same basic argument, but
<br />
applied to all observers rather than just the individual who was injured.
<br />
