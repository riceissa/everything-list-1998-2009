Mark:
<br />
<br />Accepting broadly your summary up to this point...............
<br />
<br />MP:  But I have to *challenge you to clarify* whether what I write
<br />
next really ties in completely with what you are thinking.
<br />
<br />DN:  My seconds will call on you!
<br />
<br />MP:  Consciousness is something we know personally, and through
<br />
discussion with others we come to believe that their experience
<br />
is very similar.
<br />
<br />DN:  OK, but If you push me, I would say that we 'emerge' into a personal
<br />
world, and through behavioural exchange with it, come to act consistently as
<br />
if this constitutes an 'external' environment including a community of
<br />
similar worlds. For a nascent individual, such a personal world is initially
<br />
'bootstrapped' out of the environment, and incrementally comes to
<br />
incorporate communally-established recognition and explanatory consistencies
<br />
that can also be extrapolated to a embrace a wider context beyond merely
<br />
'personal' worlds.
<br />
<br />MP:  This can be summarised as 'The mind is
<br />
what the brain does', at least insofar as 'consciousness' is
<br />
concerned, and the brain does it all in order to make the body's
<br />
muscles move in the right way.
<br />
<br />DN:  I would say that 'minds' and 'brains' are - in some as yet
<br />
not-fully-explicated way - parallel accounts of a seamless causal network
<br />
embracing individuals and their environment.  Depending on how this is
<br />
schematised, it may or may not be possible to fully correlate
<br />
top-down-personal and bottom-up-physical accounts.  Nonetheless, ISTM more
<br />
natural to ascribe intentionality to the individual in terms of the
<br />
environment, rather than 'the brain getting the body's muscles to move' -
<br />
i.e. &quot;I move my hand&quot; runs in parallel with a physical account involving the
<br />
biology and physics of brain and body, but both ultimately supervene on a
<br />
common 'primitive' explanatory base.
<br />
<br />MP:  The answer is that the brain is structured so that behaviours -
<br />
potentially a million or more human behaviours of all sorts - can be
<br />
*stored* within the brain. This storage, using the word in a wide sense, is
<br />
actually changes to the fine structures within the brain [synapses, dendrite
<br />
location, tags on DNA, etc] which result in [relatively] discrete,
<br />
repeatable patterns of neuronal network activity occurring which function as
<br />
sequences of muscle activation
<br />
<br />...........&lt;snip&gt;.........
<br />
<br />Behaviours, once learned, become habitual i.e. they are evoked by
<br />
appropriate circumstances and proceed in the manner learned unless varied by
<br />
on-going review and adjustment. Where the habitual behavioural response is
<br />
completely appropriate, we are barely conscious of the activity; we only pay
<br />
attention to novelties and challenges - be they in the distant environment,
<br />
our close surroundings, or internal to our own bodies and minds.
<br />
<br />DN:  Your account reads quite cogently, and we may well agree to discuss the
<br />
issues in this way, but crucially ISTM that our accounts are always oriented
<br />
towards particular explanatory outcomes - which is why one size doesn't fit
<br />
all.  So let's see if this shoe fits............
<br />
<br />MP:  I have put this description in terms of 'behaviours' because I
<br />
am practising how to deal with the jibes and stonewalling of
<br />
someone who countenance only 'behavioural analysis'
<br />
descriptions
<br />
<br />DN:  Ahah....  I confess I've had a little peek at your dialogues with a
<br />
certain individual on another forum, and I think I discern your purpose and
<br />
your problem.  All I can say is that we conduct the dialogue a little less
<br />
fractiously on this list.   For what it's worth, I probably wouldn't expend
<br />
much more effort on someone with so entrenched a position and so vitriolic a
<br />
vocabulary.  If you set your mind to it, you can describe anything in
<br />
'behavioural' or alternatively in 'structural' terms - A series or B series
<br />
- 'block' or 'dynamic' - but the form by itself doesn't necessarily explain
<br />
more one way or the other.  And as far as 'stimulus-response' goes, I
<br />
suppose I could say that when I 'stimulate' the gas pedal, my car 'responds'
<br />
by accelerating, but that doesn't by itself provide a very productive theory
<br />
of automotive behaviour.  But, if you have fresh energy for the
<br />
fray.........
<br />
<br />Best of luck
<br />
<br />David
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; David,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We have reached some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understanding in the 'asifism' thread, and I would summarise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that, tilted towards the context of this line of this thread,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more or less as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; follows.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Existence -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       The irreducible primitive is existence per se;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       that we can know about this implies differentiation in and of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that which exists;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       that we can recognise both invariance and changes and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; participate in what goes on implies _connection_.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am sure there must be mathematical/logical formalism which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could render that with exquisite clarity, but I don't know how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to do it. Plain-English is what I have to settle for [and aspire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to :-]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are a couple of issues that won't go away though: our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience is always paradoxical, and we will always have to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; struggle to communicate about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Paradox or illusion -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think people use the word 'illusion' about our subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience of being here now because they don't want to see it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as paradoxical. However AFAICS, the recursive self-referencing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entailed in being aware of being here now guarantees that what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we are aware of at any given moment, i.e. what we can attend to,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can never be the totality of what is going on in our brains. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of mind, some of it - indeed probably the majority - is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unconscious. We normally are not aware of this. [Duh, that is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what unconscious means Mark!] But sometimes we can become aware
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [acutely!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of having _just been_ operating unconsciously and this is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; salutary, once the sickening embarrassment subsides anyway :-0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For those of us who have become familiar with this issue it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no hardship but there are many who resist the idea. The least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mortifying example that is _easy to see in oneself_ is what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens when we look for something and then find it: before we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find it the thing is 'not there' for us, except that we might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that it is really. Then we find it; the thing just pops
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into view! As mundane as mould on cheese, but bloody marvellous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as soon as you start thinking about how it all works!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I have to *challenge you to clarify* whether what I write
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next really ties in completely with what you are thinking.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll try it in point form for brevity's sake.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Behaviour and consciousness -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       Consciousness is something we know personally, and through
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discussion with others we come to believe that their experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is very similar.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       Good scientific evidence and moderately sceptical common sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tell us is this experience is _intimately and exclusively_ bound
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; up with the activity of our brains. Ie the experience - the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious awareness of the moment as well as the simultaneous or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; preliminary non-conscious activity - is basically what the brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does, give or take a whole range of hormonal controls of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rest of the organism. This can be summarised as 'The mind is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what the brain does', at least insofar as 'consciousness' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concerned, and the brain does it all in order to make the body's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; muscles move in the right way.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       People's misunderstanding about how we are conscious seems to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; centre around how mere meat could 'have' this experience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       The answer is that the brain is structured so that behaviours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; - potentially a million or more human behaviours of all sorts -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be *stored* within the brain. This storage, using the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in a wide sense, is actually changes to the fine structures
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; within the brain [synapses, dendrite location, tags on DNA, etc]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which result in [relatively] discrete, repeatable patterns of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; neuronal network activity occurring which function as sequences
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of muscle activation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       For practical purposes behaviours usually involve muscles
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moving body parts appropriately. [If muscles don't move, nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else can be sure if anything is going on]. However, within the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; human brain, learning also entails the formation of neuronal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; network activity patterns which become surrogates for or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternatives to overtly visible behaviours. Likewise the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely internal detection of such surrogate activities
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becomes a kind of surrogate for perception of one's own overt
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviours or for perception of external world activities which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would result from one's own actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       Useful and effective response and adaptation to the world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; requires the review of appropriateness of one's overt behaviour
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and to be able to adjust or completely change one's behaviours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; both at very short notice and over arbitrarily long periods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depending on the duration of the effects of one's actions. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; entails responding to one's own behaviours over whatever time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scale is necessary.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       Behaviours, once learned, become habitual i.e. they are evoked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by appropriate circumstances and proceed in the manner learned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unless varied by on-going review and adjustment. Where the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; habitual behavioural response is completely appropriate, we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; barely conscious of the activity; we only pay attention to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; novelties and challenges - be they in the distant environment,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; our close surroundings, or internal to our own bodies and minds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Who? -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *       The concept of responding to one's own responses being the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; basis of consciousness causes some to complain that this implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some kind of infinite regress of observers. What actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens is that internal brain behaviours [discrete network
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; activations] occur as surrogates for all the relevant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environmental features of interest, including one's own body and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the storyline we are following. Where surrogates for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; environmental features are linked in with surrogates for 'self'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [body and storyline] and with network activations that stand for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relationships between those features of environment and self,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THAT, moment by moment, is something which exists. So there is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'something it is LIKE something to be' and that is what it is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The registration of novelty and the responses to it, reviewed in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ceaseless recursive cycles, gives us the basis of subjective time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have put this description in terms of 'behaviours' because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; am practising how to deal with the jibes and stonewalling of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone who countenance only 'behavioural analysis'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; descriptions. I am happier recognising that most internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; behaviours can be called 'representations' - it is much more

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; succinct.

<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; where I identify &lt;&lt;&lt;???&gt;&gt;&gt; as a &quot;necessary primitive&quot; and comment that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; 'computation' or 'information' or 'complexity' have only the vaguest of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; arm waving grip on any claim to such a specific role. Such is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; emergence' genre.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Just so.  My own 'meta-analysis' is also a (foolhardy?) attempt to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identify the relevant 'necessity' as *logical*.  The (awesome) power
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of this would be to render 'pure' 3-person accounts (i.e. so-called
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'physical') radically causally incomplete.  Some primitive like yours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; would be a *logically necessary* foundation of *any* coherent account
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of 'what-is'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Strawson, and Chalmers, as I've understood them, make the (IMO)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; fundamental mis-step of proposing a superadded 'fundamental property'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the 'physical' substrate ('e.g. 'information').  This has the fatal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; effect of rendering such a 'property' *optional* - i.e. it appears
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that everything could proceed just as happily without it in the 3-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; person account, and hence 'consciousness' can (by some) still airily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be dismissed as an 'illusion'.  The first move here, I think, is to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; stop using the term 'consciousness' to denote any 'property'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; My own meta-analysis attempts to pump the intuition that all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; processes, whether 0, 1, or 3-person, must from *logical necessity* be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; identified with 'participative encounters', which are unintelligible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in the absence of *any* component: namely 'participation', 'sense',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and 'action'.  So, to 'exist' or 'behave', one must be:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) a participant (i.e. the prerequisite for 'existence')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) sensible (i.e. differentiating some 'other' in relationship)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3) active (i.e. the exchange of 'motivation' with the related 'other')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and all manifestations of 'participative existence' must be 'fractal'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to these characteristics in both directions (i.e. 'emergence' and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'supervention').  So, to negate these components one-by-one:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1) if not a participant, you don't get to play
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 2) if not sensible, you can't relate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3) if not active in relationship, you have no 'motivation'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; These logical or semantic characteristics are agnostic to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'primitive base'.  For example, if we are to assume AR as that base,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then the 'realism' part must denote that we 'participate' in AR, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'numbers' are 'mutually sensible', and that arithmetical relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; is 'motivational'.  If I've understood Bruno, 'computationalism'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; generates 'somethings' at the 1-person plural level.  My arguments
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; against 'software uploading' then apply at the level of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'emergent somethings', not to the axiomatic base. This is the nub of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the 'level of substitution' dilemma in the 'yes doctor' puzzle.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In 'somethingist' accounts, 'players' participate in sensory-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; motivational encounters between 'fundamental somethings' (e.g.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; conceived as vibrational emergents of a modulated continuum).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; The critical move in the above argument is that by making the relation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; between 0,1, and 3-person accounts and the primitives *self-relation*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or identity, we jettison the logical possibility of 'de-composing'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; participative sensory-motivational relationship.  0,1, and 3-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are then just different povs on this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 0 - the participatory 'arena' itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 1 - the 'world' of a differentiated 'participant'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 3 - a 'proxy', parasitising a 1-person world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Zombies' and 'software' are revealed as being category 3: they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'parasitise' 1-person worlds, sometimes as 'proxies' for distal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; participants, sometimes 'stand-alone'.  The imputation of 'soft
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; behaviour' to a computer, for example, is just such a 'proxy', and has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; no relevance whatsoever to the 1-person pov of the distal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'participatory player'.  Such a pov can emerge only fractally from its
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; *participative* constitution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; principle of the kind X must exist or we wouldn't be having this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; discussion. There is no way to characterise explanation through magical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; emergence that enables empirical testing. Not even in principle. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; impotent at all prediction. You adopt the position and the whole job is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; done and is a matter of belief = NOT SCIENCE.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Well, I'm happy on the above basis to make the empirical prediction:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; No 'computer' will ever spontaneously adopt a 1-person pov in virtue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of any 'computation' imputed to it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You, of course, are working directly on this project.  My breath is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; bated!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; For me, one of the most important consequences of the foregoing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; relates to our intuitions about ourselves.  We hear from various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; directions that our 1-person worlds are 'epiphenomenal' or 'illusory'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; or simply that they don't 'exist'.  But this can now be seen to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; vacuous, deriving from a narrative fixation on the 'proxy', or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'parasite', rather than the participant.  In fact, it is the tacit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assumption of sense-action to the parasite (e.g. the 'external world')
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that is illusory, epiphenomenal and non-existent.  Real players -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; participators - inherit the precursors of *all* their characteristics
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from the primitives on which they supervene: hence the fundamental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'spontaneity' (i.e. 'given-ness') of the primitives must also emerge,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mutatis mutandis, at the 1-person level.  This is crucial, because we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; can now stop gibbering about 'illusion' (which of course isn't to say
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that we can never be mistaken).  Our personal worlds really are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'something like' - sensorily, motivationally - the explanatory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; primitives on which they supervene.  After all, sans magic, how else
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; could it be?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Cheers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
