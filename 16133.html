<br />It is technical. It just happen that the logic of the self-

referential, or Gödelian Beweisbar provability predicate is completely  
<br />
and soundly axiomatized by the modal logic G and G*. And the modal  
<br />
logic G belongs to the type of logic which possesses a  
<br />
characterization in term of a Kripke semantics. (note that G* losses  
<br />
the Kripke semantics).

</em><br />
<br /><br />Thanks for helping. I will think about how to explain AUDA in simple  
<br />
terms. UDA shows that physics is in your head. AUDA shows that physics  
<br />
is in the head of any universal digital machine. This transforms the  
<br />
mind-body problem into a pure mathematical problem, or sequence of  
<br />
mathematical problems. Then we can compare the physics in the head of  
<br />
the machine and physics &quot;out there&quot;, and so we can test the comp hyp.
<br />
<br />Let me give a short try, for helping to answer your question of the  
<br />
reconciliation of Kripke multiverse and provability. It is standard  
<br />
material.
<br />
<br />Godel's second incompleteness theorem 1931 says that if the formal  
<br />
system Principia Mathematica PM is consistent then PM cannot prove  
<br />
that PM is consistent. Gödel did already completely understand that PM  
<br />
was able to prove its own incompleteness theorem (although the  
<br />
detailed proof will be given by Bernays and Hilbert later (and then  
<br />
brillantly simplified by Löb)).
<br />
PM can prove that if PM is consistent then PM cannot prove that PM is  
<br />
consistent. More simply: PM proves that &quot;IF I am consistent, then I  
<br />
cannot prove that I am consistent&quot;:
<br />
<br />PM proves    NOT(BEWEISBAR(FALSE)) -&gt;  
<br />
NOT(BEWEISBAR(NOT(BEWEISBAR(FALSE)))
<br />
<br />where BEWEISBAR is Gödel's 1931 provability predicate, and FALSE is  
<br />
some Gödel number representing the statement &quot;0 = 1&quot; in PM language.  
<br />
The whole is a first order arithmetical sentence.
<br />
<br />Now that first order arithmetical sentence look like a modal  
<br />
statement. Writing NOT with &quot;~&quot;, BEWEISBAR with a box &quot;B&quot;, and FALSE  
<br />
with f, the formal, that is really the one output by the machine or by  
<br />
the formal system becomes
<br />
<br />~Bf -&gt; ~B~Bf
<br />
<br />or with the diamond (B~p is equivalent with ~Dp, and D~p is equivalent  
<br />
with ~Bp). t is ~f.
<br />
<br />Dt -&gt; DBf, which provides the reading that &quot;If I am consistent then it  
<br />
is consistent that I am inconsistent&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br />Already here, given that this is a modal statement, it is natural to  
<br />
ask oneself if there is a Kripke &quot;multiverse&quot; satisfying that modal  
<br />
statement.
<br />
A Kripke multiverse satisfies a statement when the statement is true  
<br />
in all worlds of the multiverse. A multiverse here is just a set of  
<br />
worlds with an accessibility relation.
<br />
<br />How to find an accessibility relation making the statement &quot;Dt -&gt; DBf&quot;  
<br />
true in all worlds of a multiverse?
<br />
<br />If Dt is true in a world ALPHA, say, you need to have DBf true in that  
<br />
world ALPHA  too (you want &quot;Dt -&gt; DBf&quot; true everywhere!). But to have  
<br />
DBf true in ALPHA, you have to be able to access (by the accessibility  
<br />
relation) a world where Bf is true. (By the definition of Kripke  
<br />
semantics). But Bf can be true only in cul-de-sac worlds (if not f  
<br />
would be true in some world). So ti have Dt-&gt;~BDt, or Dt-&gt;DBf, you  
<br />
have to live in what I called a Papaioannou multiverse, or a realist  
<br />
multiverse (in Conscience et Mecanisme), that is a multiverse where  
<br />
all worlds have an access to a culd-de-sac world.
<br />
<br />The same remains for the generalisation Dp -&gt; ~BDp (equivalently Dp -&gt;  
<br />
DB~p).
<br />
<br />Now, if you remember that ~p is equivalent to p -&gt; f (or redo the two  
<br />
lines truth table), you can write consistency, Dt, that ~Bf as Bf-&gt;f,  
<br />
by simple transformations:
<br />
<br />~Bf -&gt; ~B~Bf is equivalent with
<br />
B~Bf -&gt; Bf by contraposition. And this is equivalent (by Bf equivalent  
<br />
with Bf -&gt; f).
<br />
<br />B(Bf-&gt;f)-&gt;Bf
<br />
<br />The generalization (f/p) of this formula gives the Löb formula B(Bp- 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;p)-&gt;Bp, which is the formal (machine) version of the theorem of Löb,  
</em><br />
which indeed says that if PM proves BEWEISBAR('p') -&gt; p then PM proves  
<br />
p. (Curiously enough, Boolos 1993 gives five reasons to be  
<br />
astonished!). See the arithmetical placebo in the same2004, or the  
<br />
&quot;proof&quot; of the existence of Santa Klaus, in the archive or Bools'  
<br />
books, or better Smullyan which varies about that theme in Forever  
<br />
Undecided.
<br />
<br />Solovay shows that in the normal modal logics, Löb's formula, B(Bp-&gt;p)- 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;Bp, axiomatizes completely the logic (G) of provabilty.
</em><br />
<br />Now B(Bp-&gt;p)-&gt;Bp has more complex Kripke semantics, but one of them is  
<br />
given by the finite transitive irreflexive multiverse. You can verify  
<br />
this by hand on simple examples. Not only you have always access to  
<br />
dead end (cul-de-sac world), but all your path end somewhere. In term  
<br />
of life (which fortunately will NOT concern the first person), not  
<br />
only you can die at each &quot;om&quot;, but you will eventually die. But as I  
<br />
say, and Torkel Franzen did see something similar here, the G world  
<br />
are not &quot;OMs&quot;; the G logic is really third person self-reference (its  
<br />
modal world are not OMs: it is more a logic of scientific  
<br />
communication than a logic a first person knowledge. The amazing  
<br />
things which I exploit, is that we can study the logic of the first  
<br />
person knowledge attached to the machine, despite it can be shown that  
<br />
the first person is not definable by the machine, or by PM, PA, ZF,  
<br />
whatever rich classical theory or Löbian machine. You cannot define  
<br />
the notion of first person, or of consciousness, or even the notion of  
<br />
Truth in the language of any (consistent) machines. Yet machines can  
<br />
reason about those notion indirectly. The trick is already in the  
<br />
Theaetetus of Plato, or even used by Plotinus (as Bréhier, the first  
<br />
french translator of Plotinus, suggested).
<br />
All this will concern all the mechanical or less mechanical consistent  
<br />
extensions of those machine or theories.
<br />
<br />Hope this gives some clues. I guess we can come back on this. AUDA is  
<br />
technical for sure. G and G* is just two hypostases, but the others  
<br />
come from them.
