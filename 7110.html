I wanted to add a few points to my earlier posting about how to derive
<br />
OM measure in a Schmidhuberian multiverse model.
<br />
<br />The method is basically to take all the universes where the OM appears
<br />
and to sum up the contribution they make to the OM measure.  However,
<br />
the key idea is that this contribution has two components.  One is the
<br />
measure of the universe.  The greater the measure of the universe, the
<br />
greater the contribution to OM measure.  But the other is the fraction
<br />
of the universe that is involved in the OM.  This means that a smaller
<br />
universe that contains an OM gives a greater fraction of its measure
<br />
as its contribution to the OM measure.  Smaller universes make more
<br />
contribution than larger ones.
<br />
<br />This last step may seem ad hoc but in fact it can be seen in a very
<br />
natural way.  It can be thought of as a two step way to output the
<br />
description of a given OM: first write a program to output a universe
<br />
with the OM in it, then write a program to take that universe and output
<br />
the OM.  We can think of combining these two programs into one: write a
<br />
program that outputs the OM.  Then, the sum of the measure of all such
<br />
programs is the measure of the OM.
<br />
<br />That last sentence is merely the definition of measure in a Schmidhuberian
<br />
context - the measure of anything is the fraction of all programs that
<br />
output that thing.  It IMPLIES the formula I described for downgrading a
<br />
universe's contribution to an OM by virtue of the relative size of the OM
<br />
compared to the universe.  It can be said that we have derived and proven
<br />
that relationship by assuming this fundamental definition of measure.
<br />
<br />Note that we could also write a program to output an OM without regard
<br />
to creating a universe first.  However, I believe that at least for
<br />
observers like us, it will always be a much simpler program to first
<br />
create a universe and then find the OM in it.  This lets evolution work
<br />
and everything is simple.  Ultimately, this allows the AUH (all universe
<br />
hypothesis, ie the multiverse exists) to JUSTIFY the belief that we are
<br />
not brains (or OMs) in vats, that the universe is probably real.
<br />
<br />Okay, so that's just restating what I had before in different words,
<br />
explaining it from a different perspective that might be more obvious.
<br />
Here are a couple of interesting additions.
<br />
<br />First, what about our universe?  Why is it so damn big?  If the measure
<br />
of an OM is smaller in a big universe, the AUH should predict that
<br />
the universe is no bigger than it needs to be.  Yet, looking around,
<br />
our universe looks a lot bigger than necessary.  There's a lot of
<br />
wasted space.
<br />
<br />I conclude that it is likely that the universe is not in fact much
<br />
bigger than it needs to be.  It actually needs to be as big as it is.
<br />
This might imply that intelligent life is extremely rare in universes
<br />
like ours.  Only by creating a truly enormous universe can we have a
<br />
good chance of creating observers.
<br />
<br />Let me expand on this a little.  All universes exist.  Some have
<br />
complex laws of physics and some are simple.  Some have complex initial
<br />
conditions and some are simple.  Physicists believe that our universe
<br />
is relatively simple by both measures.  The laws of physics are not
<br />
completely understood but the ones we know have a very simple mathematical
<br />
formulation.  And the initial conditions also appear to represent a very
<br />
smooth and uniform condition immediately after the Big Bang.  The bottom
<br />
line is that you would not have to write a very big program to simulate
<br />
our universe.
<br />
<br />Yet, even with these simple laws, our universe supports life that can
<br />
evolve into consciousness.  That's pretty amazing, maybe.  What are
<br />
the odds that another universe with equally simple laws could do so?
<br />
We know that our own physical laws appear to be relatively &quot;fine tuned&quot;
<br />
such that even a tiny change in various properties would cause life as
<br />
we know it to be impossible.  That suggests that maybe it is not so
<br />
easy to have life.  Maybe almost no universes with laws as simple as
<br />
ours create life.
<br />
<br />And, maybe life is not all that easy to create even in our universe.
<br />
What if life, at least intelligent life, is overwhelmingly unlikely,
<br />
even in a universe as well suited as our own?  Maybe we need ten billion
<br />
light years' worth of galaxies, stars and planets in order to have a
<br />
decent chance of evolving life.  Maybe, in short, our universe is as
<br />
big as it needs to be, given our laws of physics, to allow life to evolve.
<br />
<br />There may be other sets of laws of physics that would be more fecund,
<br />
where life could evolve more easily.  Those might get by with smaller
<br />
universes.  But if so, the AUH would predict that such universes would
<br />
have much more complicated laws of physics and/or initial conditions
<br />
than our own.  Otherwise we would live there.
<br />
<br />Given that the universe is as big as we see, and given the AUH, we can
<br />
predict that it is not full of intelligent life.  We can predict that
<br />
there should be almost no other intelligent civilizations within the
<br />
universe.  This then solves the Fermi paradox - where are the aliens.
<br />
There are no aliens, not for cosmological distances.
<br />
<br />This leads to my second point: what about infinities?  In some models,
<br />
our own universe is infinite in size.  Tegmark's level 1 multiverse
<br />
postulates a physically infinite space.  His level 2 sees our universe
<br />
as an infinite bubble inside a larger chaotic inflation region, with
<br />
infinite numbers of other bubbles.  How could my proposed formulation
<br />
of OM measure work if the universe is infinite in size?  How can we
<br />
determine the fraction of universe measure dedicated to an OM if the
<br />
OM is infinitesimal in size compared to the universe?
<br />
<br />I have two thoughts about this.  One is that if the universe is truly
<br />
spatially infinite, any OM should be repeated infinite times, as Tegmark
<br />
predicts.  Therefore the OM still occupies a finite fraction of the
<br />
universe resources, and we can calculate that fraction by taking the
<br />
limit as spatial size goes to infinity.  I know that some people don't
<br />
like this limit approach, they get upset by trying to divide one infinity
<br />
by another, but in practice this method seems sensible and produces a
<br />
reasonable value.
<br />
<br />The other approach focuses on a paradox between level 1 and level 2.
<br />
If the level 1 universe is infinite in extent, where are the level 2
<br />
universes?  Other dimensions?  That doesn't really work, physically.
<br />
<br />Here is how I understand it.  In physics, time and space are relative.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the level-2 perspective, our universe is finite in size.  However,
</em><br />
it is constantly and eternally growing.  From within the universe,
<br />
the level-1 perspective (our point of view!) time and space have gotten
<br />
shifted so that the finite-size but infinite-time outside view becomes
<br />
infinite-size from the inside view.  I've seen drawings of this.  It is
<br />
consistent to have a universe that looks spatially infinite but from the
<br />
outside is finite in size but constantly growing.  It's all a matter of
<br />
event horizons and such.
<br />
<br />This provides a method to at least partially solve the infinite-size
<br />
paradox.  From the level 2 perspective, the universe is no longer infinite
<br />
in size, however it is infinite in time.  This means that it takes only
<br />
a finite amount of computation to simulate the universe up to any given
<br />
point in space and time.  We can simulate the past light cone of any point
<br />
in spacetime within our universe using a finite amount of computation,
<br />
even though the universe looks spatially infinite from each point.
<br />
<br />This allows us to again apply our program to find OMs within the output
<br />
of the program creating a universe.  Each OM appears after only a finite
<br />
length of output. And the farther out we go, the longer the OM-finding
<br />
program is going to need to be, because it has to localize the OM within
<br />
the output of the universe program.  That means at some point we can
<br />
ignore further OM instances appearing in the tape as having negligible
<br />
measure (he says, waving his hands furiously) because the program to
<br />
find them would have to be so big.
<br />
<br />In effect what we are saying is that there is a nonuniform measure
<br />
over spacetime in our own universe, one that tails off to zero in space
<br />
and time.  Now, I'm not 100% sure how that works spatially, it seems to
<br />
suggest that there is a point in space that has more measure than all
<br />
others, which doesn't seem very physical.  I'll have to think about it.
<br />
But it is basically consistent with the general Schmidhuber principle
<br />
that measure of X is 1/2^KC(X), applied to OMs.  If we live in a level
<br />
2 multiverse, as our best physical theories suggest, then the measure
<br />
of the OMs in that multiverse have to work in a method similar to what
<br />
I have outlined here.
