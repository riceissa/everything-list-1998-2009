Thanks for the quotes from Dennett's &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot;. The physiological experiments are interesting, 
<br />
but the fact is, even if they can be shown to be flawed in some way, it would still be entirely consistent 
<br />
with our behaviour and our subjective experience of free will if we acted first, then noticed what we had 
<br />
done and decided we had acted freely. 
<br />
<br />As for FW being a combination of random and determined, it has to be, doesn't it? What else is there? 
<br />
Roulette wheels also have to be a combination of random and determined, and if you can pin down the 
<br />
&quot;determined&quot; part, you could be rich.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;conscious.  But if I provide it with &quot;attention&quot; and memory, so that it noted the

<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's interesting that people actually withdraw their hand from the fire *before* they experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pain. The withdrawl is a reflex, presumably evolved in organisms with the most primitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; central nervour systems, while the pain seems to be there as an afterthought to teach us a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lesson so we won't do it again. Thus, from consideration of evolutionary utility consciousness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does indeed seem to be a side-effect of memory and learning.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; Even more curious, volitional action also occurs before one is aware of it. Are you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; familiar with the experiments of Benjamin Libet and Grey Walter?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; These experiments showed that in apparently voluntarily initiated motion, motor cortex activity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; actually preceded the subject's awareness of his intention by a substantial fraction of a second.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; In other words, we act first, then &quot;decide&quot; to act.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does Benjamin Libet's Research Empirically Disprove Free Will ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Scientifically informed sceptics about FW often quote a famous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment by benjamin Libet, which supposedly shows that a kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; signal called a &quot;Readiness Potential&quot;, detectable by electrodes,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; precedes a conscious decisions, and is a reliable indicator of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision, and thus -- so the claim goes -- indicates that our decisions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are not ours but made for us by unconsious processes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, Libet himself doesn't draw a sweepingly sceptical conclusion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from his own results. For one thing, Readiness Potentials are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; always followed by actions. he believes it is possible for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consicousness to intervene with a &quot;veto&quot; to the action:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;The initiation of the freely voluntary act appears to begin in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain unconsciously, well before the person consciously knows he wants
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to act! Is there, then, any role for conscious will in the performing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of a voluntary act?...To answer this it must be recognised that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious will (W) does appear about 150milliseconds before the muscsle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is activated, even though it follows the onset ofthe RP. An interval of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 150msec would allow enough time in which the conscious function might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; affec the final outcome of the volitional process.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Libet, quoted in &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 230 )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;This suggests our conscious minds may not have free will but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather free won't!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (V.S Ramachandran, quoted in &quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 231 )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, it is quite possible that the Libertarian doesn't need to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appeal to &quot;free won't&quot; to avoid the conclusion that free won't doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Libet tells when the RP occurs using electrodes. But how does Libet he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; when conscious decison-making occurs ? He relies on the subject
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reporting the position of the hand of a clock. But, as Dennett points
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out, this is only a report of where it seems to the subject that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various things come together, not of the objective time at which they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occur.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Suppose Libet knows that your readiness potential peaked at second
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 6,810 of the experimental trial, and the clock dot was straight down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (which is what you reported you saw) at millisecond 7,005. How many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; milliseconds should he have to add to this number to get the time you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were conscious of it? The light gets from your clock face to your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eyeball almost instantaneously, but the path of the signals from retina
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; through lateral geniculate nucleus to striate cortex takes 5 to 10
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; milliseonds -- a paltry fraction of the 300 milliseconds offset, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how much longer does it take them to get to you. (Or are you located in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the striate cortex?) The visual signals have to be processed before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they arrive at wherever they need to arrive for you to make a consicous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decision of simulataneity. Libet's method presupposes, in short, that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we can locate the intersection of two trajectories: # the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rising-to-consciousness of signals representing the decision to flick #
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the rising to consciousness of signals representing successive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clock-face orientations so that these events occur side-by-side as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were in place where their simultaneity can be noted.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 231 )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dennett refers to an experiment in which Churchland showed, that just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pressing a button when asked to signal when you see a flash of light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; takes a normal subject about 350 milliseconds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does that mean that all actions taking longer than that are unconcisous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The brain processes stimuli over time, and the amount of time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depends on which information is being extracted for which purposes. A
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; top tennis player can set up to design a return of service within 100
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; milliseconds or so. The 78 feet from base line to base line can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traversed by a serve from Venus Williams [...] in less than 450
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; milliseconds [...] And since the precise timing and shape of that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; return depends critically on visual information and put it to highly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate use in that short a time. As Churchland showed, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pressing a button when asked to signal when you see a flash of light
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; takes a normal subject about 350 milliseconds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 238 )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Our lives are full of decisions to act when the time is ripe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; revisable commitments to policies, and attitudes that will shape
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; responses that must be executed top swiftly to be reflectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered in the light of actions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 239 )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The timing tricks usually fit together seamlessly and are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incorporated into the brain's own monotoring of what it is up to, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in artifical cicumstances (as set up by clever experimenters) the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tricks can be exposed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 239 )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is important to separate the idea that of an action being done (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not) by you, being consciously done (or not) by you, and the being done
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (or not) by you at a moment in time. The Tennis player who reacts too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quickly to have made a conscious decision is reacting too quickly ot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have made a decision at that time. On the other hand, their decisions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is not unwelcome or unexpected. It feels like their decision. And why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should it not when it is the outcome of long practice, practice of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; kind that is necessary to fulfil any taks that requires precise timing,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such as sport or music. The consciousness of the decision comes from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cnsncious decision to train oneself to react in a certain way. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; consciousness of the act is stored, and pre-prepared, and using it we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can perform feats where Libet's 300m sec. delay would be quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unnacceptable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     One thing going for this hypothesis is that such judgements of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simultaneity are unnatural acts in the first place, unless they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; framed for a particular purpose, such as your trying to get your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; staccato attack in sync with the conductor's downbeat, or trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; connect with a low fastball so a to send it straight back over the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pitcher's head.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (&quot;Freedom Evolves&quot; by Daniel Dennett, p. 235 )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Dennett's idea of &quot;stored&quot; conscious volition is quite in line with our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; theory. Indeed, we would like to extend it in a way that Dennett does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not. We would like to extend it to stored indeterminism. Any decision
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we make in exigent situations wher we do nto have the luxury of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conisdered thought must be more-or-less determinsistic -- must be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more-or-less determined by our state of mind at the time - -if they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to be of any use at all to us. Otherwise we might as well toss a coin.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But our state of mind at the time can be formed by rumination, training
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and so over a long period, perhaps over a lifetime. As such it can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain elemetns of indeterminism in the positive sense -- of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; imagination and creativity, not mere caprice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This extension of Dennett's criticism of Libet (or rather the way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Libet's results are used by free-will sceptics) gives us a way of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; answering Dennett's own criticisms of Robert Kane, a prominent defender
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of naturalistic Free Will.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; These studies did not examine pre-planned
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; action (presumably that would be far more technically difficult) but it is easy to imagine the analogous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; situation whereby the action is unconsciously &quot;planned&quot; before we become aware of our decision. In
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; other words, free will is just a feeling which occurs after the fact.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's equally easy to imagine the opposite.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This is consistent with the logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; impossibility of something that is neither random nor determined, which is what I feel my free will to be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; FW can be an appropriately structured mixture of the two.
