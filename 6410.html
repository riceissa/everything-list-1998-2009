Greetings
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Well, it's of course always *possible* that what we see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;cannot really be explained by current knowledge. Even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Galileo must have wondered if yet further laws were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;really governing his falling objects, laws beyond
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;d = (1/2)t^2 and g = at.  (He would have been right to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;wonder, of course, since in 1905 and 1915 we learned that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;there was a bit more to it.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But I would have had to side with a believer at the time:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;You've done it, Galileo! So far as we can tell, you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;nailed it, to the greatest extent that we can measure it!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Yes, I too would have &quot;wondered&quot;, but not for long: &quot;Absence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of evidence is not evidence of absence&quot;, I'd say.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
Precisely. You would have been a admirer of an amazingly powerful and 
<br />
predictive model that also happened to be incomplete. No shame there, 
<br />
but it illustrates my point that the solution to intractable problems 
<br />
that resisted the physics of past eras, often had to await a fresh 
<br />
fundamental approach before being cracked.You refer to  SR and GR, I 
<br />
assume, but  another good example I think is the many body problem 
<br />
tossing chaos into the orderly &quot;universe&quot; of Galileo's beneficiary, 
<br />
Newton. And the complexity of these systems are downright simple 
<br />
compared to the weather, markets and yes consciousness. Of course new 
<br />
approaches need not replace, but rather extend existing models.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Still nothing, though, that says quantum mechanics and GR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;aren't perfect in their respective arenas? (Not, of course,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the reconciliation isn't a big problem itself.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Agreed. I just think QM is and will remain insufficient in the arena of 
<br />
explaining Consciousness and a host of other complex systems with 
<br />
testable, verifiable predictions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm probably not following. Is it or isn't it the case that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in the laboratory we have phenomena which there is serious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reason to believe cannot be explained by QM? Can a skeptic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;really point to any 3rd person phenomenon and say, &quot;clearly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;QM can't explain that!&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
Science is a method, not a doctrine. If QM can make testably verifiable 
<br />
predictions about emergent phenomena, then it succeeds; otherwise it fails.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;If consciousness is the strongest card that can be played
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to support the idea that we need new laws of physics, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I'll join those who think that it's not much. It wouldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;make sense on evolutionary grounds for typical mammals
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;such as ourselves to be unable to report internal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;impressions, plans, feelings, and anticipations. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
This it seems to me is a black box approach. Shades of Skinner's 
<br />
behaviorism? Not terribly useful or satisfying IMHO. One could take the 
<br />
same approach to any biological system or process: pronounce it adaptive 
<br />
(at least sufficiently till now) and leave it.at that. &quot;Next problem!&quot;. 
<br />
Fortunately for any of us who will unfortunately suffer from one disease 
<br />
process or another (not the least of which aging), medical research 
<br />
chooses instead to look further than that and strives to understand the 
<br />
mechanisms and thus intervene with these amazingly complex systems. 
<br />
Complexity (or plectics as Gellman has suggested) and network studies 
<br />
have already helped inform this process. It seems likely that if new 
<br />
principles &quot;emerge&quot; from such disciplines, they may well contribute even 
<br />
more to this goal. It might also be that the same principles that would 
<br />
make powerful, tested predictions about, say, the immune system might 
<br />
serve to shed strong light upon the nature of consciousness too.
<br />
<br />Thus far, despite the best efforts of Hammerhoff, Penrose and the like, 
<br />
QM has failed to do so.
<br />
<br />We shall see..
<br />
<br />Cheers
