<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think you probably misunderstood what you read. What's true is that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal priors based on different Turing machines are close to each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other, up to a multiplicative factor that depends on the pair of universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; priors being compared. But this multiplicative factor is not necessarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; insignificant in terms of practical consequences, and there are other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; candidiate measures proposed by Juergen that seem about as attractive as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universal priors (i.e. the less dominant speed prior, and the more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dominant one based on GTMs which I'm not sure has a name).
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I went back and checked (a paper by Li and Vitanyi and someone else)
<br />
and you are right, the priors are only the same up to a constant factor.
<br />
I agree that this is too weak a sense in which the priors are &quot;close&quot; to
<br />
each other to be useful.  Also these kinds of comparisons are only really
<br />
meaningful in an asymptotic sense as we go to infinite length strings.
<br />
For finite strings a constant factor says essentially nothing about how
<br />
close two distributions are to each other.
<br />
<br />I'm not convinced about the models of computation involving GTMs and
<br />
such in Juergen Schmidhuber's paper.  Basically these kinds of TMs can
<br />
change their mind about the output, and the machine doesn't know when
<br />
it is through changing its mind.  So there is never any time you can
<br />
point to the output or even a prefix and say that part is done.  It is
<br />
questionable to me whether this ought to count as computation.  I will
<br />
write some more about his paper tomorrow, I hope.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; One thing you do give up when you abandon the concept of an objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure is an explanation of why you are who(/when/where) you are. But I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't shake the feeling that perhaps the question doesn't really make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense, because how could you not be who you are? However, if you don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to give this up, you can keep the notion of an objective measure just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the purpose of having this explanation, but adopt an arbitrary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; subjective measure for making decision. In other words, even if you think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is an objective measure, you don't have to care about each universe
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in proportion to its measure.
</em><br />
<br />I wonder if a better term than &quot;objective measure&quot; is &quot;probability&quot;.
<br />
That carries the connotation that it represents the likelihood that
<br />
something happens.  Then you could have an objective probability which
<br />
told how likely each universe was (its chance of being selected at
<br />
random from the multiverse), and a subjective measure that told how
<br />
much you cared about universes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now suppose you could manipulate the beliefs of your future selfs and not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have them remember the manipulations (e.g. like the protagonist in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; movie Momento). What would you want your future selfs to accept as the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objective measure? Well it would be the same as your subjective measure,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because otherwise you'd be in a situation where the future selfs that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; care a lot about don't have a good explanation for why they are where they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are, while some of the ones you don't care much about do have a good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explanation. And what's the downside to your future selfs believing in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the &quot;incorrect&quot; objective measure? There doesn't seem to be one.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe you should multiply the subjective measure times the objective
<br />
measure.  Then the subjective measure can play the role of utility in game
<br />
theory, and the objective measure is as suggested above the probability.
<br />
This brings us back onto familiar territory.  Rather than dealing with
<br />
this abstract &quot;measure&quot; which is just a number that is associated with
<br />
a universe, we have probability and value, the traditional basis for
<br />
making decisions.
