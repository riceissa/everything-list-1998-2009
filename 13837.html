Le 15-août-07, à 17:00, David Nyman a écrit :
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; What comp (by UDA+FILMED-GRAPH) shows, is that, once the digitalness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; your local relative description is taken seriously, you can no more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; distinguish the comp stories existing below your comp substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; level.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, 'materiality' - for you - can consist in effect only of what is at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or above this level?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. The visible will appear as a sum of the invisible.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Eventually the laws of physics will be the law of what remains
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or emerges as observable in all computations.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Again - for all observers - what emerges at or above their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution level?
</em><br />
<br /><br />This is exactly what we will have to compute.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; From inside this has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; interfere statistically (by UDA).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is, from inside comp reality, not inside 'matter'?  Then, given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this, statistical interference leads to first person indeterminacy.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say the contrary. The first person indeterminacy comes from the 
<br />
fact that (relative) computational histories can diverge, and does 
<br />
diverge in case of self-differentiation or bifurcation like in the WM 
<br />
duplication experiment. Then the statistical interference emerges from 
<br />
the first (plural, hopefully) indeterminacy. If you drop a pen, to 
<br />
compute EXACTLY what will happen in principle, you have to consider all 
<br />
comp histories in UD* (the complete development of the UD) going 
<br />
through your actual state (the higher level description of it, which 
<br />
exists by comp, but which is actually not knowable by you. Of course 
<br />
this cannot be used in practice, but has to be used to derive the more 
<br />
usable laws of physics.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; How? I would say by self-measurement relatively to their most probable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (or credible ...) comp histories. There is always an infinity of them.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How does 'self-measurement' lead to the observables of physics?  By
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'most probable' I assume you mean the convergence of first person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience on such histories.  Is this what you mean by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'self-measurement' (i.e. the convergence by self-sampling on a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first-personal 'measure')?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. And after the 8th step of the UDA, you should understand that the 
<br />
&quot;physical implementation of the UD&quot; is not relevant, because a UM 
<br />
cannot distinguish &quot;reality&quot; (&quot;real&quot; or virtual) from purely 
<br />
arithmetical reality,
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; You can see my thesis either as a the showing that comp necessitates 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; generalize Everett embedding of the subject into the physical world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (Cf also Rossler endophysiocs). Indeed comp forces us to embed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arithmetician (or any memory machine) in numberland (something for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; which we will never have a complete unification).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is comp therefore in effect a 'many minds' view?  In this case, do the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'many worlds' emerge as the observables contingent on the povs of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many minds (from the background of numberland)?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I would say yes. I have often used the expression &quot;many dreams&quot; where a 
<br />
dream is an infinite set of (non interacting or independent) infinite 
<br />
computations. Logicians, like modal logicians are using the term 
<br />
&quot;world&quot; as something primitive and indefinite: a world is just an 
<br />
element of a set. They uses it intechangeably with &quot;states&quot;, &quot;points&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;elements&quot; etc. Does the many dreams generates anything like a singular 
<br />
physical world: well probably not. Does the many dreams generate a 
<br />
quantum multiverse? Well, if comp (and my reasoning) is correct then it 
<br />
has to do that. Does it, up to now yes (Again I anticipate).
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I said in Siena, and already in this list, that for Plato, what *you*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; see (observe, measure) is the border of what *you* don't see. In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal machine context this can lead to a recursive but solvable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; equation where physical reality is a sort of border of the comp-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indeterminacy or the comp intrinsical ignorance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When you refer to the observables as the border of what you don't see,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or the border of the comp indeterminacy, are you again referring to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the indistinguishability of what lies below one's substitution level?
</em><br />
<br /><br />Absolutely.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If so, would this not imply the potential existence of an infinity of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels of observables, or physics(s), depending on the substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; levels of classes of observers?
</em><br />
<br />All right, but note that we have no choice concerning our level of 
<br />
substitution. And the physics (observables) will be a &quot;sum&quot; on all 
<br />
possible fine grained histories consistent with your actual state. If 
<br />
comp is really at the origin of the quantum empirical interference, the 
<br />
&quot;reason&quot; why &quot;an electron&quot; can go through two holes simultaneously, is 
<br />
that the electron &quot;choice&quot; has no impact at all, even in principle, 
<br />
with your actual and successor  comp histories.
<br />
Empirically we can expect that the 'substitution level&quot; is more related 
<br />
to a notion of &quot;isolation&quot; than of scaling. Nevertheless, we cannot 
<br />
really use this here, given that we have to extract quantum physics 
<br />
from the existence of that &quot;level&quot;.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; In a nutshell, you cannot use Godel incompleteness to show that we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; not machine (or that we are not lobian), but you can use Godel
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; incompleteness to argue that IF we are sound lobian machine then we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; cannot know which machine we are, still less which computations 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; support
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; us. It gives the arithmetical origin of the first person comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; indetermincacy, which you are supposed to have already intuitively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; swallow from the UDA, OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK.  However, I still have in reserve my question about how we are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; supposed to think about the relation between, say, our minds and some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observable version of our brains.
</em><br />
<br /><br />'course, this is tricky and quite counterintuitive: a third person 
<br />
description of a brain (what we usually call &quot;brain&quot;) is most probably 
<br />
a relative comp state with respect to (relative) comp histories. The 
<br />
3-brain is just not a physical device for producing consciousness, it 
<br />
is a local and relative &quot;description&quot; of a state making greater the 
<br />
probability that you will be able to manifest your first person 
<br />
experience relatively to some &quot;dream&quot;, itself being an infinite set of 
<br />
histories.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, how are we supposed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; account for how changes to some version of our brains seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correlate with changes of mind, or how the physical evolution of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brains relates to that of minds?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Where a layman says: the temperature in Toulouse is 34.5,  the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; logician
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; says:   temperature(Toulouse) = 17.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it colder for logicians?
</em><br />
<br /><br />No, just one of the false sentences I was talking about. Just to see if 
<br />
your are not sleeping (if you mind that kind of deformed teacher bad 
<br />
joke :)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; So an arbitrary function from n-tuple to number will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; be denote by f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n). Exactly like in the definition of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; an arbitrary derivative in calculus: the limit, if it exists, for h
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; going near zero of the quotient f(x + h) - f(x) with h. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK, thanks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I propose to go, from the Cantor non-enumerability of the reals (or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; things equivalent) to Kleene non recursive enumerability of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; recursive reals, by Church thesis. Comp, both in the UDA, and in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; arithmetical UDA, is mainly Church thesis. I want to show you how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; strong and deep that thesis is. OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; OK
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Now diagonalization will appear to be a sort of &quot;transcendental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; operation&quot;. Its main use is for going outside some set, and I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; like to convey why the fact that the set  &quot;programmable functions&quot; is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; closed for diagonalization is truly a miracle! (to borrow Godel's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; expression). It is really that miracle which makes the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; programmable or computable function fitting so well the search for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; universal everything theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think I see what you mean - i.e. that extensions to the set by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diagonalisation are also programmable functions, which makes the set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in effect a closed but infinite universe.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes. Can you explain why the set of all binary sequences *is* closed 
<br />
for diagonalization, and why any *enumerable* set of binary sequences
<br />
is *not* close for diagonalization?
<br />
A set is said enumerable if there is a bijection between that set and 
<br />
the set of natural numbers. A bijection from a set A to B is a function 
<br />
b from A to B such that for any x in A, b(x) is defined and is in B, 
<br />
all element of B are equal to some b(x) with x in A, and if x is 
<br />
different from y in A, then b(x) is different from b(y).
<br />
<br />A bit more difficult: can you show that for any set A, the set of 
<br />
functions from A to {0,1} is bigger than A? and BTW, do you see that 
<br />
there is a bijection between the set of functions from A to {0,1} and 
<br />
the sets of parts of the set A. (A set S is said to be part of B, i.e. 
<br />
S is included in B, i.e.  we have for all x that (x belongs to S 
<br />
implies x belongs to B). Can you see why this entails that the empty 
<br />
set {} is included in all sets).
<br />
<br />Sorry for those little exercise. The one a bit more difficult is know 
<br />
as Cantor theorem. I give the solution when you ask, even just for 
<br />
comparing with your answer, which you don't have to put on the list (we 
<br />
are *not* at school here ...).
<br />
<br />All this should help some others, and of course, they are free and even 
<br />
invited to ask if they have a problem.
<br />
<br />Is it ok for everybody that:
<br />
<br />The union of A and B is equal to the set of x such that x belongs to A, 
<br />
OR x belongs to B.
<br />
The intersection of A and B is equal to the set of x such that x 
<br />
belongs to A, AND x belongs to B.
<br />
The complement of A in B is equal to the set of x such that x belongs 
<br />
to B and does NOT belongs to A.
<br />
<br />The first line can be written A U B = {x : x is-in A OR x is-in B}   
<br />
non exclusive OR.
<br />
<br />OK?  (It would be too bad people loose the real difficulty because of 
<br />
notation trouble, so let us take the time to revise a bit those 
<br />
things).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Well, ok, sorry. Instead of &quot;the non enumerability of the subset of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; N&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; read &quot;the non enumerability of the set of subsets of N&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Have you take a look on my old diagonalization post which I send to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Lennart?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, thanks.
</em><br />
<br />I will come back on this.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Did this post helped? I want you to understand Church thesis, before
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the description of some formal language. This will economize work, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; help you disentangle the rigorous from the formal. In our setting,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;formal&quot; will always mean &quot;output by a machine&quot;. Don't believe that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; formal = rigor. That would be equivalent to believe that all machines
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; are correct (a nonsense).  OK?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, very helpful.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK. I will come back on this too.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Bruno
