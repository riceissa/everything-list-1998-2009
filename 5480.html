Hi Kory,
<br />
<br /><br />(Recall: the 1-9 points we mention can be find by clicking on

<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks very much for your clarifications. I clearly misunderstood the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intent of your point 8. I thought you were arguing that, if we analyze the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;structure of all possible 1st-person histories of all possible 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-aware-subsystems in Platonia, we would find that histories that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exhibit the basic elements of what we commonly think of as our &quot;laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics&quot; - say, light, gravity, etc. - have a greater measure than those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;histories that contain (say) &quot;srats and gilixas&quot;, and that therefore our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;local laws&quot; are the most common ones in Platonia. I find this position 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;highly dubious, but I no longer think that's what you were saying.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Nice.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;My new interpretation of what you're saying (and correct me if I'm wrong 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;again) is that if you were to examine the entire ensemble of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;next-possible-states&quot; of *me* (Kory Heath) at this moment, you would find 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that (as a mathematical fact, part of the basic structure of Platonia) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most of them contain galaxies and stars, etc. Therefore, the regularities 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I see around me are simply the emergent effect of my &quot;first person 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indeterminacy domain&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;K: If we imagine some other computational state that represents a SAS with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a personality, memories of growing up in a world that contains &quot;srats and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gilixas&quot;, etc., most of that SAS's next-possible-states would contain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;srats and gilixas, so a very different set of stable &quot;local laws&quot; would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emerge from that SAS's &quot;first person indeterminacy domain&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />Well, we should expect that what makes stable
<br />
those different geographical data
<br />
(galaxies and gilixas) are semblable. The physical
<br />
laws should be what makes both
<br />
galaxies and gilixas stable.
<br />
The laws of physics will be the same, but they
<br />
can be &quot;implemented&quot; in highly different &quot;geographical&quot;
<br />
manners.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;(We can imagine that the resulting regularities resemble a 4+1D cellular 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;automata, which contains nothing like our gravity, light, etc.).
</em><br />
<br /><br />Actually (but this is a premature technical point) 4+1D
<br />
classical cellular automata will not work.
<br />
Let us come back to this point later. (You can remember me).
<br />
It *is* a probable non trivial consequence of 9.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm still confused by some parts of your post. I don't see why the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assumption that most of my &quot;next-possible-states&quot; do in fact contain stars 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and galaxies necessarily follows from points 1-7.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Well, it follows from comp and the data &quot;stars
<br />
and galaxies&quot;, and the belief that stars
<br />
and galaxies are not complete illusion. It is clear
<br />
that at some point it will be necessary to be
<br />
a little more specific about the distinction
<br />
geography/physics.
<br />
Grosso modo laws should be necessary,
<br />
unlike geographical data which are contingent but
<br />
should be consistent with the physical laws.
<br />
Up to this point (the whole 1-8) it is natural to expect
<br />
that physical laws could be trivial (equivalent to the
<br />
classical tautologies for example): in that case,
<br />
comp would entails that there is no physical laws
<br />
(at least in the strong sense I use implicitly until
<br />
now). Everything would be geographical! But
<br />
I will give below reason to believe that comp does
<br />
not make physics so trivial. The basic reason
<br />
comes from Godel's theorem.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here's a very rough sketch of what I think points 1-7 *do* imply:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Platonia contains every possible computational state that represents a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-aware structure, and for each such state there are X number of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;next-possible-states, which also exist in Platonia. The chances of one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;self-aware state &quot;jumping&quot; (I know my terminology is dangerously loose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;here) to any particular next state is 1 / X, where X is the total number 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of next-possible-states for the state in question. Any regularities which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emerge out of this indeterminate traversal from state to state will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;perceived as local &quot;laws of physics&quot;.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I mainly agree. The differences are those I usually
<br />
make. Indeed a machine can have only a finite
<br />
number of possible states, but the DU (comp platonia)
<br />
will go through those states infinitely often and the
<br />
probability will be defined on the set of complete
<br />
histories (those distinguishable in principle).
<br />
A priori there are 2^aleph_0 histories.
<br />
Your  last sentence is a little bit ambiguous (probably
<br />
because we have not yet decide a criteria for the
<br />
geography/physics distinction). It is really the invariant
<br />
we observe &quot;out of this indeterminate traversal from
<br />
state to state&quot; which will play the role of laws
<br />
of physics, and those will be global. Now those laws will
<br />
be among those things which make galaxies stable, but
<br />
I would not put the existence of galaxies in the &quot;local&quot;
<br />
physical laws,  only what makes those galaxies stable.
<br />
So that &quot;laws&quot; will be global (by mere definition).
<br />
I have mention that up to this point the laws could be
<br />
trivial, but of course they could also be non trivial; so much
<br />
that the existence of galaxies would be a law. I doubt it
<br />
but the whole point of 1-8 is to show that with comp
<br />
the laws of physics are derivable by the 1-view of
<br />
consistent machines, and we will see....
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, you say: &quot;Let us (re)define the laws of physics as the laws we can 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;always predict and verify consistently (if any!). Now, having accepted the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;1-7 points, the occurrence of such laws must have a measure 1, so the laws 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of physics must be derivable from what has measure 1 relatively to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure on the computational histories.&quot; I agree with this, but to me it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;seems like a simple tautology - another statement of my above paragraph.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I am sorry. I didn't express myself in a very perspicuous
<br />
way. It certainly looks like a tautology.
<br />
I think I should have just say: from 1-8 the laws of physics
<br />
should be redefined as what is consistent and verifiable in
<br />
all &quot;next states&quot; (all closer consistent
<br />
extensions).
<br />
This looks still tautological, but actually is not. But here
<br />
we are at the pivotal moment between the point 8 and 9.
<br />
It is really Godel's theorem which will make the notion
<br />
of verifiable and consistent not trivial at all. Remember
<br />
simply that the second Godel incompleteness theorem
<br />
entails that a consistent machine cannot even prove the
<br />
existence of just one consistent extension!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;It sounds to me like you're saying that the (local) laws of physics are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever regularities emerge when we examine the entire ensemble of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;next-possible-states from my current state (and the ensemble of all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;next-possible-states from each of those possible-states, and so on). This 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is tautologically true - &quot;whatever emerges, emerges&quot;. The real question 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is, what reason do we have to believe that any regularities actually 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;emerge? In other words, how do we *know* that most of my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;next-possible-states&quot; do in fact contain stars and galaxies? This idea 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;doesn't necessarily follow from anything in points 1-7.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps you're arguing the following: we do in fact perceive a world 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;filled with regularities, which we have codified into our local &quot;laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics&quot;. Therefore, *if* points 1-7 are true - that is, if &quot;comp&quot; is true 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;- then it must be the case that most of my &quot;next-possible-states&quot; do in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact contain stars and galaxies and gravity and light. If I were (somehow) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;able to completely mathematically analyze one of my computational states 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and all of its next-possible-states, and if I then determined that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;probabilities in this ensemble of next-possible-states *didn't* match the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regularities I actually perceive, then I should conclude that comp is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;false. If this is your argument, then it might be helpful to add another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;point - lets call it Point 7.5 - which states that &quot;we do in fact perceive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;regularities that we codify into (local) laws of physics&quot;. Then your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;argument can run: if points 1-7.5 are all true, then it must be true that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most of my next-possible-states contain stars and galaxies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This argument implies a constraint on comp - which is good, because it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;means that comp is falsifiable -
</em><br />
<br /><br />That's the whole point indeed.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;but it doesn't give me any clue how to show mathematically that most of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Kory Heath's next-possible-states actually do contain stars and galaxies - 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;i.e. that most of Kory Heath's next-possible-states match the laws of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;physics, or at least exhibit some kind of probabilistic bias that would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;result in perceived regularities.
</em><br />
<br /><br />OK, but that will follow from the point 9,
<br />
which is the one you originally ask me
<br />
about. We will come back on this.
<br />
The important point is that once we keep up comp
<br />
through the eight points, we see that the laws of
<br />
physics, whatever they are, must be given
<br />
by the invariant in the comp-accessible worlds.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suppose that this is what you mean when you say that we need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;&quot;modelize&quot; or better &quot;identify&quot; a platonistic observer by a sound modest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(lobian) universal church-turing-post-markov-fortran-lisp-java-whatever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;machine (including quantum one)&quot;, and to &quot;interview it about those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relative consistent extensions and its inferable platonistic geometries 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and what is stable in their discourses.&quot; I have to confess that I don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a very clear picture of what results you've derived from all of that.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I have derived the logic of the yes-no
<br />
possible physical experiments, or, put in
<br />
another way, I have derived the mathematical
<br />
constraints bearing on the measure one
<br />
verifiable propositions. Normally I have derived
<br />
enough to say if there is a quantum computer
<br />
present (or not) in the neighborhood (collection of
<br />
the closer consistent extension) of any
<br />
observer-sound lobian machine. That would make
<br />
a great part of quantum physics into physical
<br />
laws in the sense of comp.
<br />
It would be a pleasure to explain this with
<br />
more details. Are you willing to hear a little
<br />
bit about Godel's theorem and some of its
<br />
generalisation by Lob and Solovay?
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm also somewhat confused by the following statement:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But &quot;platonistically&quot; it remains that if comp is true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the actual physical invariant must emerge as an average
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;on ALL the maximal consistent extensions relative to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;actual states (worlds, observer-moments, whatever ...).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Although that can be proved useless for actually predicting the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;behavior of the chalk, it is enough for deriving physics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If this is enough for &quot;deriving physics&quot;, why isn't it enough to predict 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the behavior of falling chalk, since gravity is one of the most basic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;elements of our physics? Or are you referring to something different than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the &quot;local geographical laws&quot; that we call physics?
</em><br />
<br /><br /><br />OK here I have been *very* unclear. I should have said
<br />
that with comp we can indeed derive the behavior of the chalk,
<br />
but only by deriving the laws of physics first. This is true
<br />
for quantum mechanics also. The &quot;real&quot; fundamental laws
<br />
are so complex that they are useless for mondane
<br />
prediction. Nobody will ever use Feynman path integral
<br />
technic for predicting the chalk behavior, and this is truer
<br />
once we use comp where it can be shown that an exact
<br />
derivation of the exact behavior is uncomputable (but that is
<br />
the case also, in an lesser way, with QM).
<br />
<br />To sum up: with the comp hyp 1-8
<br />
shows that the laws of physics are given by the proposition
<br />
UD-accessible, verifiable and consistent.
<br />
The point 9, that is an actual beginning of a derivation of the
<br />
physical laws gives quickly something non tautological
<br />
and actually not trivial at all thanks to the bearing
<br />
of Godel's incompleteness phenomena about what
<br />
sound machines can actually prove and infer about
<br />
their consistent extensions.
<br />
Thanks for giving me the opportunity of being
<br />
(hopefully) clearer. Have you still some question on the 1-8
<br />
points? If not, we can tackle the point nine which is
<br />
obviously more technical (but full of marvellous
<br />
quasi-magical happenings!) OK?
<br />
