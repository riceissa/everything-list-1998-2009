<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; The other issue matter is able to explain as a result of having no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; properties of its own is the issue of change and time. For change to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; distinguishable from mere succession, it must be change in something.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It could be a contingent natural law that certain properties never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; change. However, with a propertiless substrate, it becomes a logical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; necessity that the substrate endures through change; since all changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; are changes in properties, a propertiless substrate cannot itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; change and must endure through change. In more detail here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Why must &quot;change... be change in something&quot;? It sort of sounds reasonable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but it is our duty to question every assumption and weed out the superfluous
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ones. If there is an object with (space, time, colour) coordinates (x1, t1, red)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and another object (x1, t2, orange), then we say that the object has changed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from red to orange.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If we already know what distinguishes the time co-ordinate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from the space co-ordinate. What is our usual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way of doing that? The time co-ordinate is the one that is always
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; changing...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time and Possibility
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Imagine a universe in which there was no change, nothing actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; occurs. In the absence of events, it would be imposssible to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; distinguish any point in timw from any other point. There would be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meaning to time -- such a universe would be timeless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now imagine a universe which is completely chaotic. Things change so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely from one moment to the next that there are no conistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things. This universe is made up solely of events, which can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; labelled with 4 coordinates . [ x,y,z,t]. But which coordinate is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time coordinate ? One could just as well say [ y,t,z,x]. In the absence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of persistent ojects there is nothing to single out time as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'direction' in a coordinate system. So again time is meaingless.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In order to have a meaningful Time, you need a combination of sameness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (persisitent objects) and change (events). So time is posited on being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; able to say:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Object A changed from state S1 at time T1 to state S2 at time T2.&quot;
</em><br />
<br />You're just stating that time is different from space. Time and space are also 
<br />
different from colour, or any other property an object may have. If we didn't 
<br />
have time there would be no change, if we didn't have height everything would 
<br />
be flat, and if we didn't have colour everything would be black.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I don't see how a physical multiverse would be distinguishable from a virtual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reality or a mathematical reality (assuming the latter is possible, for the sake
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of this part of the argument). The successive moments of your conscious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experience do not need to be explicitly linked together to &quot;flow&quot; and they do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; not need to be explicitly separated, either in separate universes or in separate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; rooms, to be separate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've never seen an HP universe. Yet they *must* exist in a mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, because there are no random gaps in Platonia. Since all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; structures are exemplified, the structure corresponging to (me up till
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1 second ago)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; + (purple dragons) must exist. If there is nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical to keep out of HP universe, the fact that I have never
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seen one is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evidence against a mathematical multiverse.
</em><br />
<br />That you don't experience HP universes is as much an argument against a physical 
<br />
multiverse as it is an argument against a mathematical multiverse. If a physical MV 
<br />
exists, then in some branch you will encounter purple dragons in the next second. 
<br />
The fact that you don't means that either there is no physical multiverse or there is 
<br />
a physical multiverse but the purple dragon experience is of low measure. Similarly in 
<br />
a mathematical multiverse the HP experiences may be of low measure.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; If you died today and just by accident a possible next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moment of consciousness was generated by a computer a trillion years in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; future, then ipso facto you would find yourself a trillion years in the future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's the whole problem. I could just as easily find myself in an HP
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe. But I never do.
</em><br />
<br />Not &quot;just as easily&quot;. If you are destructively scanned and a moment from now 2 copies 
<br />
of you are created in Moscow and 1 copy created in Washington, you have a 2/3 chance 
<br />
of finding yourself in Moscow and a 1/3 chance of finding yourself in Washington. It is a 
<br />
real problem to explain why the HP universes are less likely to be experienced than the 
<br />
orderly ones (see chapter 4.2 of Russell Standish' book for a summary of some of the 
<br />
debates on this issue), but it is not any more of a problem for a mathematical as opposed 
<br />
to a physical multiverse.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But if you had the successive moments of your consciousness implemented
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; in parallel, perhaps as a simulation on a powerful computer, it would be impossible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to tell that this was the case. For all you are aware, there may not *be* any past
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; moments: your present experience may include false memories of your past, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; whole world may have been created a second ago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; A simulation running on a computer is still a dynamic, temporal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; process. The point is that the passage of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time tells me that I am not in Platonia.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time Capsules: Getting Flow from Sequence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Proponents of the Block Universe view believe that there is only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; B-Series. Some think that alone is adequate to explain the subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Flow-of-Time. It is easy enough to see how there could be a sequence in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the B series. If we consider a series of 3 dimensional &quot;snapshots&quot; of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; someone's brain, each subsequent snapshot iwll contain information
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relating back to previous ones.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But is this chain or sequence enough to establish flow ? A B-series
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without an A-series is like a spatial series. If you had a series of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; clones arranged spatially so that clone 2 has all of clone 1's memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (and more), clone 3 has all of clone 2's memories (and more) and so on,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would not expect anything to be flowing from one clone to another.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The clones form a series of &quot;time capsules&quot;, and a such they have a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural sequence, but that is all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Without an A series, there is nothing to justify the idea that only one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time capsule is conscious &quot;at a time&quot;. Either they all are, or none
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are. We know we are conscious, so we must reject the &quot;none are&quot; option.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The Block Universe therefore predicts that all time capsules are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious. This is in line with the way the Block Universe spatialises
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Time. It predicts that consciousness is a single 4-dimensional entity.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would not just be conscious now with memories of the past, I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a consciousness in the past overlaid on my present consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />Whether the Block Universe model is right or not, the series of clones you 
<br />
describe, set up as an experiment, would still give the experience of being 
<br />
continuously conscious through time. I remember being conscious a second 
<br />
ago but how could I possibly know that I didn't just pop into existence 
<br />
complete with false memories half a second ago? All I know is what I am 
<br />
experiencing *now*. It is only because I have memories and a sense of being 
<br />
the same person over time that I consider it was &quot;I&quot; who woke up this morning 
<br />
and it will be &quot;I&quot; again who goes to bed tonight. I don't have a direct telepathic 
<br />
link to past or future selves, or copies in the next room, to ensure that they are 
<br />
&quot;really me&quot;. All I have to go on are my present memories and beliefs, which could 
<br />
in theory be artificially implanted without changing anything about my stream of 
<br />
consciousness. Nothing is changed if we say that we live only transiently, and the 
<br />
feeling that we persist as individuals through time is an illusion.
