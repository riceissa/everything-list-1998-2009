<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm not sure of the details of your experiments, but wouldn't the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; direct way to prove what you are saying be to isolate just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that physical process
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which cannot be modelled? For example, if it is EM fields, set up an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriately
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain-like configuration of EM fields, introduce some environmental input,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; show that the response of the fields deviates from what Maxwell's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would predict.

</em><br />
<br />I don't expect any deviation from Maxwell's equations. There's nothing
<br />
wrong with them. It's just that they are merely a very good representation
<br />
of a surface behaviour of the perceived universe in a particular context.
<br />
Just like QM. But it's only the surface. The universe is not made of EM or
<br />
QM or atoms or space. All these things are appearances. and it's what they
<br />
are all actually made of with is what delivers its appearances.
<br />
<br />It's a pretty simple idea and it's been around for 300 years (and it's not
<br />
a substance dualism!). The paper I'm writing at the moment (nearly
<br />
finished) is about how this cultural delusion that the universe is made of
<br />
our models pervades the low-level physical science. It's quite stark...the
<br />
application of situated cognition to knowledge is quite pervasive. You can
<br />
take a vertical slice all the way through the entire epistemological tree
<br />
from social sciences down through psychology..cognitive
<br />
science..ecology..ethology..anthropology ||
<br />
neuroscience...chemistry..physics. The || is the sudden break where
<br />
situated cognition matters and where physics, in particular cosmology is
<br />
almost pathologically intent on the surgical excision of the scientist
<br />
from the universe. Situated cognition applied to metascience at the level
<br />
of physics is simply absent.
<br />
<br />You can see it in the desperate drive to make sense of QM maths, as if the
<br />
universe is made of it...that the only way that any sense can be made of
<br />
it is to write complex stories about infinite numbers of universes, all of
<br />
which are somehow explanatory of the weirdness of the maths, rather then
<br />
deal with what the universe is actually made of....when right in front of
<br />
all of them is the perfect way out...start talking about what universes
<br />
must be made of in order that it can omplement scientists that have
<br />
perception....to realise that the maths of empirical laws is just a model
<br />
of the stuff, not the stuff.
<br />
<br />Cosmologists are the key. They have some sort of mass fantasy going about
<br />
the mathematics they use. Totally unfounded assumptions pervade their
<br />
craft - far worse than any assumption that the universe is not made of
<br />
idealsised maths...the thing that gets labeled erroneously 'metaphysics'
<br />
and eschewed.
<br />
<br />I have done a cartoon representation of a cosmologist made of stuff in a
<br />
unoiverse of stuff staring at the cosmos wondering where all teh stuff is,
<br />
when the fact of be able to stare _at all_ is telling him about the deep
<br />
nature of of the cosmos. Poor little deluded cosmologist.
<br />
<br />There's nothing wrong with Maxwell's equations. In fact there's nothing
<br />
wrong with any empirical laws. The problem is us...
<br />
<br />cheers,
<br />
