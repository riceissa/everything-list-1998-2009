<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In your definition of the ASSA, why do you define it in terms of your next 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer moment?
</em><br />
<br />The ASSA and the RSSA were historically defined as competing views.
<br />
I am not 100% sure that I have the ASSA right, in that it doesn't seem
<br />
too different from the SSSA.  (BTW I have kept the definitions at the end
<br />
of this email.)  (BTW, BTW means By The Way.)  But I am pretty sure about
<br />
the RSSA being in terms of the &quot;next&quot; moment, so I defined the ASSA the
<br />
same way, to better illustrate its complementary relationship to the RSSA.
<br />
<br />The real difference between these views was not addressed in my
<br />
glossary, which is that the RSSA is supposed to justify the QTI, the
<br />
quantum theory of immortality, while the ASSA is supposed to refute it.
<br />
That is, if you only experience universes where your identity continues,
<br />
as the RSSA implies, then it would seem that you will never die.  But if
<br />
your life-moments are ruled by statistics based on physical law as the
<br />
ASSA says, then the chance that you will ever experience being extremely
<br />
old is infinitesimal.
<br />
<br />Personally I think the ASSA as I have it is somewhat incoherent, speaking
<br />
of a &quot;next&quot; observer moment in a framework where there really isn't any
<br />
such notion.  But as I said it has been considered as the alternative
<br />
to the RSSA.  I invite suggestions for improved wording.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wouldn't it be possible to have a version of the SSA where 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you consider your *current* observer moment to be randomly sampled from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; set of all observer-moments, but you use something like the RSSA to guess 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what your next observer moment is likely to be like?
</em><br />
<br />That seems contradictory.  You have one distribution for the current
<br />
observer-moment (sampled from all of them), and another distribution for
<br />
the next observer-moment (sampled from those that are continuous with
<br />
the same identity).  But the current observer-moment is also a &quot;next&quot;
<br />
observer-moment (relative to the previous observer-moment).  So you can't
<br />
use the ASSA for current OM's and the RSSA for next OM's, because every
<br />
next is a current, and vice versa.  (By OM I mean observer-moment.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, what about a weighted version of the ASSA? I believe other animals are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious and thus would qualify as observers/observer-moments, which would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suggest I am extraordinarily lucky to find myself as an observer-moment of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what seems like the most intelligent species on the planet...but could there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be an element of the anthropic principle here? Perhaps some kind of theory 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of consciousness would assign something like a &quot;mental complexity&quot; to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different observer-moments, and the self-sampling assumption could be biased 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in favor of more complex minds.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I think the possibility of weighting OM's is implicit in these
<br />
definitions.  We often use the term &quot;measure&quot; to indicate that some
<br />
OM's carry more weight and more probability than others.  For example,
<br />
one theory is that OM's which take a larger program to output would
<br />
have lower measure than ones which are described by a short program.
<br />
By this definition we might think that less complex minds would have
<br />
more measure, the opposite of your idea.
<br />
<br />I haven't heard of anyone suggesting that complex minds would inherently
<br />
have higher measure.  Instead, it seems that most people use a somewhat
<br />
arbitrary cutoff for complexity which is necessary to qualify as an
<br />
observer.  In the anthropic literature this general issue is discussed
<br />
as the problem of the reference class.  I'm not that familiar with all
<br />
the ideas which have been proposed.
<br />
<br />Your idea, and my alternative about less complex minds having more
<br />
measure, have the problem that it seems that much more and less complex
<br />
minds should exist in the multiverse, and as you note we obviously have
<br />
evidence of less-complex minds existing in abundance right here on Earth.
<br />
So if more complexity is better, why aren't we super-intelligent aliens?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Likewise, one might use a graded version of the RSSA to deal with &quot;degrees 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of similarity&quot;, instead of having it be a simple either-or whether a future 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment &quot;belongs to the same observer&quot; or not as you suggest in your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition. There could be some small probability that my next 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observer-moment will be of a completely different person, but in most cases 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would be more likely that my next observer-moment would be basically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; similar to my current one. But one might also have to take into account the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; absolute measure on all-observer moments that I suggest above, so that if 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there is a very low absolute probability of a brain that can suggest a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future observer-moment which is very similar to my current one (because, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; say, I am standing at ground zero of a nuclear explosion) then the relative 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probability of my next observer-moment being completely different would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; higher. Again, one would need something like a theory of consciousness to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; quantify stuff like &quot;degrees of similarity&quot; and the details of how the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tradeoff between relative probability and absolute probability would work.
</em><br />
<br />This seems hard to motivate because it fails to satisfy the desire of
<br />
RSSA proponents to get quantum immortality, while still introducing
<br />
the problematic notions of identity which the ASSA was supposed to free
<br />
us from.  Also, you would need to come up with some rules for how big the
<br />
threshold has to be in order to kick you out of your current identity-line
<br />
and into someone else's.  It looks problematic to me.
