<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Ok, I think I see where my mistake was. I was thinking that &quot;decoherence&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;just referred to interactions between a system and the external 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;environment, but what you seem to be saying is that it can also refer to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;an internal effect where interactions among the components of a system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;with many degrees of freedom cause interference terms to become 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;negligible. If that's correct, then when Wigner decided that interference 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;would cause the wavefunction of the cat or Wigner's friend to &quot;collapse&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;even before the box or the room was opened, then he was probably referring 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to this sort of internal effect, so my argument about using quantum 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;computers to simulate truly impenetrable boxes would not make a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;difference.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;decoherence&quot; refers to anything interacting with what you are, as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer, describing by a wave function, and which is not currently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;described
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by your wave function. (-&gt; need of a tensor product).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IMO, it has been discovered by Everett and it explained why we don't feel 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;split or the differentiation. Decoherence is just entanglement with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the environment, it is the contagion of the superposition state, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;linearity of the tensor product.
</em><br />
<br />I probably need to read up on the actual mathematics behind decoherence 
<br />
before I can discuss it very intelligently. Brent Meeker seemed to say that 
<br />
even in the case of an isolated system whose wavefunction we know 
<br />
completely, if it has many degrees of freedom there will be an effect which 
<br />
approximates wavefunction &quot;collapse&quot; in which interference terms become 
<br />
neglible. Presumably this does not &quot;collapse&quot; the wavefunction onto any one 
<br />
particular classical state (dead cat vs. live cat), but by eliminating 
<br />
interference terms you get something similar to classical probabilities, 
<br />
where you're free to assume the cat is &quot;really&quot; in some state all along and 
<br />
your measurement just reveals that preexisting state (interference is the 
<br />
reason you get into trouble thinking that way about the quantum world, as is 
<br />
shown most clearly by the Bell inequality).
<br />
<br />I don't know whether this diagonalization effect in an isolated system would 
<br />
normally be called &quot;decoherence&quot; or if some other term would be used. I'd 
<br />
guess that they're two sides of the same coin, since if you knew the 
<br />
wavefunction for &quot;system + external environment&quot; it would itself have a 
<br />
large number of degrees of freedom, so the principle is probably the same. 
<br />
Also, I don't know whether Wigner was referring to an internal 
<br />
diagonalization effect or to entanglement with the outside environment when 
<br />
he argued that decoherence shows that the act of opening the box and 
<br />
observing the cat has no particular importance.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;But this makes me wonder about the thought-experiment by David Deutsch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;which Hal Finney brought up, in which interference shows that an isolated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;A.I. was splitting into multiple versions which experienced different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;outcomes. Presumably a simulation of an intelligence would have a lot of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;degrees of freedom too, so why wouldn't decoherence ruin things?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ok, but then SWE is wrong at some point. Where do you think?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />What does &quot;SWE&quot; stand for?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Maybe since this is a computer simulation where we know the dynamical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;rules and initial state precisely, we would know just where to look for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;even the smallest interference effects, unlike in an ordinary macroscopic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;system where we don't have such detailed information. Also, we could run 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;such a simulation over and over again from the same initial conditions, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;which would also help to detect small statistical deviations from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;classical predictions. I once read a comment by Deutch about decoherence 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;where he said something like (paraphrasing) &quot;saying the interference terms 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;are 'almost' zero is like saying someone is a little bit pregnant.&quot; His 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;argument would probably be that although decoherence may explain why the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;world looks approximately classical in the many-worlds framework, it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;doesn't remove to postulate those other worlds in the first place.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't understand your last sentence.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />What I meant was although in practice decoherence might seem to solve the 
<br />
measurement problem and remove the need for other worlds, in principle even 
<br />
tiny interference effects are just as much in need of an explanation as 
<br />
large ones, and decoherence will not make interference disappear completely 
<br />
(as I argued above, we should be able to detect tiny interference effects in 
<br />
simulations of macroscopic systems on a quantum computer, unlike in ordinary 
<br />
macroscopic systems where we don't have enough information to know where to 
<br />
look for such tiny effects). If you view the universe as a giant 
<br />
computation, the only way to duplicate interference effects precisely is to 
<br />
compute all those other histories--I think this is the point you were making 
<br />
about Bohm and his rejection of COMP, since computing the behavior of the 
<br />
&quot;pilot wave&quot; would probably be equivalent to computing all possible 
<br />
histories of the system you are considering, and COMP says that observers 
<br />
within this computation would see their own histories as real.
<br />
