Hi,
<br />
<br />I believe one main issue here is the state of one's surviving consciousness.
<br />
There is no reason to believe that having consciousness is an on/off thing.
<br />
So if you do accept quantum immortality thinking, in a typical
<br />
death-scenario (a severe heart attack, say) we could imagine a survivalrate
<br />
of 10 %. Of the surviving 10 % you could easily imagine 9 percentage points
<br />
ending up with such a devastating brain damage that the capacity to reflect
<br />
over life, identity, happiness (and quantum immortality) is severely
<br />
damaged. This process of brain damage may then continue over the passage of
<br />
time, either as a consequence of the first brain damage or following new
<br />
deseases that surely will follow, where bits and pieces of personality
<br />
disappears. As consciousness in one sense of the word is preserved in all
<br />
experiences, you wouldn't expect to find yourself in the continuing healthy
<br />
brain scenarios, since these are highly unlikely. You would eventually
<br />
expect to find yourself at the amoeba stage as Tegmark has phrased it
<br />
(though i'm not sure if he would agree with my argument on the whole) or
<br />
rather som minimum consciousness level. Now this amoeba (or minimum
<br />
consciousness) might continue to live forever in some part of the
<br />
multiverse, but that doesn't seem too frightening because all personality
<br />
parts would be gone.
<br />
<br />Of course, in this scenario some kind of dementia is the only way to
<br />
(almost) go and therefore the best way to go, which is kind of against
<br />
customary thinking these days. Given today's medicine you will expect to
<br />
find yourself in this dementia like situation some day before you are
<br />
celebrating your 200th birthday. (One could of course place a bet on the
<br />
possibility that immortality will be the results from the advances in
<br />
genetics or AI in the next 50-100 years.)
<br />
<br />This dementia scenario seems likely as long as you are still here on mother
<br />
earth. If you stand next to a nuclear blast you would perhaps rather expect
<br />
ending up other places in the andromeda galaxy 2 million years in the future
<br />
or past or in some other universe of level 1, 2, 3 or 4 (still accepting
<br />
quantum immortality without debate). There is no way of knowing what the
<br />
probability distributions are in advance. There might be a fair chance of
<br />
ending up in a ordered world where your preserved consciousness has stable
<br />
grounds for eternal life with personality and memories evolving gradually.
<br />
But you could also imagine that the consciusness you end up with is far from
<br />
stable, so that your consciousness in this scenario also quickly  or slowly
<br />
would degrade into some nonrecognisable entity.
<br />
<br />One might hope for that scenario, anyhow. I do want to live a bit longer
<br />
than one traditionally would expect, but infinity is, well, a long time. It
<br />
would probably be rather lonely with all of your
<br />
great-great-great-great-grandchildren dead millennia ago.
<br />
<br />Dag-Ove
