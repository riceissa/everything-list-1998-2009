Shouldn't the probability go to zero faster than 1/2^n ? If you consider the
<br />
sequence of programs p_{k} were p_{k} will run k idintical copies of a
<br />
certain observer. The probability that the observer finds himself in p_{i}
<br />
should be i times the measure of  P_{i}. I conclude that the measure of p{i}
<br />
should go to zero faster than 1/i. The length of the program is some
<br />
constant plus Log(i)/Log(2),  therefore, if the measure depends only on
<br />
program length, it should go to zero faster than 1/2^n.

Subject: Violations of physical law
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I want to follow up on the discussion we had last December about &quot;flying
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbit&quot; universes.  Let me first recap my understanding of the issues.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose that all universes exist, and that they are associated with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer programs that generate them.  The measure of a universe is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defined as 1/2^n, where n is the size of the smallest program that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generates a given universe.  Can we reconcile this theory with our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observations of the universe around us?  In particular, does it explain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why we seemingly live in a lawful universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Broadly speaking, the answer is yes.  As it happens, it appears that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the laws of physics are relatively simple.  Stephen Wolfram guesses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that the entire set of laws for our universe could be reduced to about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 5 lines of Mathematica code.  So apparently a relatively simple program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be sufficient to generate our universe, with all its complexity,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; including ourselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clearly even more complex programs would also be possible to generate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes like ours.  With the additional complexity the laws of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nature could have more exceptions and allow for &quot;miraculous&quot; behavior.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Such universes are called &quot;flying rabbit&quot; universes, or sometimes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;white rabbit&quot; (after Alice in Wonderland), &quot;dragon&quot;, or &quot;Harry Potter&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes.  The idea is that these universes are basically lawful, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are rare exceptions which can be manipulated to produce results
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which violate the natural laws which hold otherwise.  The question is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; why don't we live in such a universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The answer is that to change the program from one which just implements
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the simple laws of physics to one which has the exceptions would greatly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increase its size.  To allow rabbits (but not other heavy, wingless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; animals) to fly, for example, the laws of physics would have to encode the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of a rabbit.  And since these laws are presumably expressed at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the subatomic level, defining a rabbit from that perspective would take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an enormous amount of information.  Instead of 5 lines of Mathematica the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; program would balloon to probably billions of lines or even more, most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of which was defining a rabbit.  Such a program would have infinitesimal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; measure compared to our universe.  That's why we don't see rabbits fly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Back in December I raised an objection.  A white rabbit universe is less
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probable than a simpler one by a factor of roughly 2^R, where R is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information content in defining the rabbit.  However, by the same token
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there are 2^R possible information patterns that can be described in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those R bits.  So if we consider the collection of all universes which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow for exceptions, not just for rabbit-shaped objects but for all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possible rabbit-sized objects, then the total measure of all of these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is approximately as large as for the simple universe.  So we can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really reject white rabbit universes, if we extend the notion to refer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to any universe which allows for miracles based on some special pattern
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The answer to this objection was basically that most patterns of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information are random.  So the vast majority of these universes, while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in principle allowing for miracles, would only have them be triggered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; by a phenomenon which is so rare that it will never occur in practice.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You'd have to have a huge combination of particles take on some precise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; configuration, and then maybe something bizarre would happen.  But the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chance of any such configuration arising would be so low, it would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like waiting for random thermal motions to suck all of the air out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your room.  You'd never see it in the lifetime of the universe.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, my new idea is to look at somewhat less extreme violations of laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose we have a universe which has simple natural laws like ours, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; does allow for violations based on certain patterns or configurations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of matter.  As before, the larger the pattern necessary to trigger
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exceptional behavior, the lower the measure of the universe; but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; countering that, there are just as many possible patterns which could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be used to trigger the lawless behavior.  So collectively the set of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes with some exceptions does not have much less measure than for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universes with simple laws and no exceptions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems to me, then, that it is actually likely that we live in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such a universe.  Chances our that our universe has basically simple
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natural laws, but has the chance for miracles to occur when the proper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arrangements are made.  And there's no inherent reason why the miracle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; triggering configuration has to be huge as for a white rabbit.  It could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be as simple as a few subatomic particles coming together in a certain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; way.  In fact, it's possible that such &quot;miracles&quot; happen at a relatively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high rate throughout the universe, events which violate natural laws.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think our model even predicts that there is a reasonable likelihood
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that such things happen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The only real limitation I see on the probability of lawless events
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is based on the anthropic principle.  The universe has to be lawful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; enough for intelligent life to have arisen.  If it were too easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generate energy, say, or to repel gravity, then the universe might be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chaotic and unstable.  Or perhaps life would evolve to exploit these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; possibilities and it would make things so easy that there would be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incentive for intelligence to evolve.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This suggests that as we move forward with our investigations of physics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploring new realms of matter with new tools that could not have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been reasonably evolved naturally, we should expect, with a reasonably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; high probability, to discover miracles.  We're not guaranteed to do so,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because after all even the collection of all miracle-containing universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is still not quite as probable as the simple one that has no miracles.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But collectively I think they might be as much as 1/10 as probable,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and perhaps even 1/2 as probable.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So it seems to me that this is another prediction which we can make based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the all-universe principle (AUP): that natural law may well have rare
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exceptions, and that once we begin exploring realms and configurations
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that are unlikely to have occured naturally, we may find one.  It's hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to say what the outcome is likely to be, but most likely it is something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that can be described simply, in whatever programming language most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; efficiently describes our universe's natural laws.  Maybe there's a sign
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reversal somewhere, or a constraint is simply skipped or added.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We could get unlucky and blow up the planet with some kind of energy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; release triggered by a particle accelerator.  Or maybe we'd get lucky
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and find some way to exploit the miracle to our benefit.  But I think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the AUP gives us more reason than in conventional view of physics to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expect such miraculous behavior.
