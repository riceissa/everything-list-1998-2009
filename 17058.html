Hi,
<br />
<br />OK, I will come back on the square root of 02 later.
<br />
<br />We have talked on sets.
<br />
<br />Sets have elements, and elements of a set define completely the set,  
<br />
and a set is completely defined by its elements.
<br />
<br />Example: here is a set of numbers {1, 2, 3}
<br />
and a set of sets of numbers {{1, 2}, {3}, { }}.
<br />
<br />We can do some operations, like their union, or their intersection.
<br />
Examples:
<br />
{1,2,3} union {3,4,5} = {1,2,3,4,5},
<br />
{1,2,3} intersection {3,4,5} = { }.
<br />
<br />We can verify if some relation hold for them, like equality, or  
<br />
inclusion.
<br />
{1, 2} = {2, 1, 1}   (yes!)
<br />
{1, 2} included-in {3, 2, 1}
<br />
{1, 2} not-included-in {1, 3}
<br />
<br />We can compute their powerset.
<br />
Powerset {1, 2} = {{ }, {1}, {2}, {1, 2}}
<br />
<br />We have discovered SBIJECTION between powersets of a set with cardinal  
<br />
n, and the set of binary strings of length n.
<br />
And we have presented reasons for the existence of a bijection between  
<br />
the powerset of N = {0, 1, 2, ...} and the set of infinite binary   
<br />
strings.
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />Today, I suggest we look at two new operations on sets. The product of  
<br />
sets, and the exponentiation of sets. Well, I will probably do only  
<br />
the product today.
<br />
<br />First I have to introduce a new, well actually *very* well known,  and  
<br />
absolutely important, notion: the couple.
<br />
<br />A couple is when there is two things, but with some order. It looks  
<br />
like a pair, but the order counts.
<br />
<br />Usually a couple of things a , b is designated, in math, like this:
<br />
<br />(a, b).
<br />
<br />It looks like a pair {a, b}, but it is not. Indeed, {a, b} = {b, a},  
<br />
but the couple (a, b) is NOT equal to the couple (b, a).
<br />
<br />When are two couples (a, b) and (c, d) equal? Only when a = c and b = d.
<br />
<br />Examples. the couple of number (2, 3) is not equal to the couple (3,  
<br />
2), but the couple (0, 666) is equal to the couple (0, 666).
<br />
<br />OK?
<br />
<br />APARTE: Are couples sets? No. Nor are numbers. But yes, you can easily  
<br />
represent them by sets, so we could work only with sets, but we will  
<br />
not do that. Much later we will work only with numbers, in fact. The  
<br />
very notion of representation will be important, though.
<br />
<br />Now we are ready to define the so called &quot;cartesian&quot; product of sets.  
<br />
It is indeed a cousin of Descartes' discovery that you can represent a  
<br />
point of the plane by a couple of (real) numbers. I read somewhere  
<br />
that Descartes discovered this by trying to describe a spider walking  
<br />
on a window with squared little piece of glass. But such a  
<br />
localization works also for cities like Los Angeles where you address  
<br />
is something like 15th avenue 61th street. The whole field of  
<br />
analytical geometry is founded on this idea.
<br />
<br />That cartesian idea generalises on sets A and B. It is written A X B,  
<br />
and it is defined by
<br />
the set of couples (x, y) such that x belongs to A, and y belongs to B.
<br />
<br />AXB = {(x, y) such-that x belongs-to A, and y belongs to B}.        
<br />
(compare with the preceding definitions).
<br />
<br />Example:  what is the product {0, 1} X {a, b}?  Well it is the set of  
<br />
all the couples made from elements of A in company of elements of  B,  
<br />
and in that order, with A = {0, 1}, and B = {a, b}.
<br />
So (0, a) is in there, and there are others. The product of {0, 1)  
<br />
with {a, b} is equal to
<br />
<br />{(0,a), (0, b), (1, a), (1, b)}
<br />
<br />The convenient usual cartesian drawing is, for AXB, with A = {0, 1},  
<br />
and B = {a, b} :
<br />
<br /><br />a     (0, a)   (1, a)
<br />
<br />b     (0, b)  (1, b)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;00          1
<br />
<br />A product of numbers a and b,  ab, can be conceived as the area of a  
<br />
rectangle of sides a and b. Here you can see that the product of sets  
<br />
AXB can fit in a rectangle when you dispose horizontally the elements  
<br />
of A, and vertically the elements of B. By convention, usually A is  
<br />
put horizontally, and B vertically.
<br />
But note that if the number ab is equal to the number ba, it is not  
<br />
the case that the set AXB is equal to the set BXA. (0, a) does not  
<br />
belong to BXA, for example.
<br />
<br />Exercise: to the cartesian drawing for BXA.
<br />
<br />1)
<br />
Compute
<br />
{a, b, c} X {d, e} =
<br />
{d, e} X {a, b, c} =
<br />
{a, b} X {a, b} =
<br />
{a, b} X { } =
<br />
<br />2)
<br />
Convince yourself that the cardinal of AXB is the product of the  
<br />
cardinal of A and the cardinal of B.
<br />
A and B are finite sets here. Hint: meditate on their cartesian drawing.
<br />
<br />3) Draw a piece of NXN.
<br />
<br />Solution and sequel tomorrow.
<br />
<br />Any question?
<br />
<br />Bruno
