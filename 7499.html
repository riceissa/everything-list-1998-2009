<br />Fair enough. You seem to suddenly deviate from this position at some point
<br />
below, though.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems are:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) what is the level of detail of neuronal information required;
</em><br />
<br />It doesn't matter, if that information is present in the vitrified brain.
<br />
Preliminary results look good <a href="http://leitl.org/docs/cryo/">http://leitl.org/docs/cryo/</a>
<br />
More results will be forthcoming in the next 1-2 years (this is something I
<br />
know, not guess).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) can this requisite information be preserved in a post-mortem specimen;
</em><br />
<br />See above. No showstoppers, under optimal conditions.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3) can the information be scanned or read in a way that can be used in a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computer model;
</em><br />
<br />Yes, though TEM is probably not sufficient. Scaled up cryo AFM has more than enough
<br />
resolution, and allows individual sampling of ablated molecules. In times
<br />
where CO molecules are individually sorted by the isotopes by numerical 
<br />
control, and assembled into elaborate circuits, this shouldn't require much faith.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (4) can each subsystem of neuronal function relevant to cognition be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modelled closely enough to allow emulation;
</em><br />
<br />This is the most difficult point: you have to build a system which can
<br />
abstract models, building at least 2-3 hierarchies, until you arrive at an
<br />
isofunctional model well mapped to the hardware used.
<br />
<br />I have ideas in that direction, but nothing has been tested yet.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (5) given adequate information and adequate models, is the computer power 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; available up to the task of emulation in anything like real time?
</em><br />
<br />Near future will give us systems built from moles of bits (by self-assembly
<br />
of individual molecular circuits). Pretty speedy
<br />
systems, enough for a speedup of 10^6, if not more. The difficulty lies in
<br />
obtaining a model which is isofunctional to the original. By the time you
<br />
have that model, hardware will not be a bottleneck. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I believe the level of detail required and the complexity of the required 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; models is grossly underestimated. Simply getting a 3D image of a brain down 
</em><br />
<br />No offense, but given the level of your ignorance, how do you know who 
<br />
has estimated what? 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; to electron microscopic detail, including all the synaptic connections, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be an enormous task, and it probabaly wouldn't tell us any more about 
</em><br />
<br />Yes. You need more resolution than TEM, btw. That's what automation is for.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; the mind of the brain's owner than a picture of the books on a library 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shelf would tell us about the book contents. I would bet more on mediaeval 
</em><br />
<br />I told you we have results that there's probably enough preserved for the
<br />
tissue to be retransplantable(!). Once it's in the dewar, time stops. I told
<br />
you we have current methods allowing you to resolve submolecular structures
<br />
in cryopreserved tissue. There's no fundamental reason why you can't image
<br />
kg-sized vitrified objects at atomic resolution, at least transiently where
<br />
it matters (what is this transmembrane protein, and how is it been modified, 
<br />
the membrane itself is rather boring). This is easily verified even with only 
<br />
online information.
<br />
<br />The information is preserved in the structure. Are you claiming that there is
<br />
something missing? What, precisely, then?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; monks decoding the data on a DVD sent back in time than I would bet on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scientists decoding the contents of a human mind from cryopreserved brain 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sections.
</em><br />
<br />You'll see individually accurate numerical models of simple critters +
<br />
virtual models within the 20-30 year time frame. We could do this now with C.
<br />
elegans, given 5-10 years, and a considerable budget.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If mind uploads were to become a reality, I think the best strategy would 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be research into brain-computer interfacing.
</em><br />
<br />What is your estimated time frame for advent of technology like
<br />
<a href="http://nanomedicine.com/">http://nanomedicine.com/</a>
<br />
<br />I, personally, am not holding my breath. YMMV.
