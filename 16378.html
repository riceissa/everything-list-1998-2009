<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, thanks for your report. Did you smoke the extract? It usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last for 4 minutes. It is amazing it did last so long with you, I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only one case of an experience lasting 20 minutes.
</em><br />
<br />I used this liquid &quot;extract&quot; stuff.  You hold it in your mouth for
<br />
several minutes to get it into your blood stream.  Seems to work very
<br />
well.  The first time I tried the &quot;Strong&quot; dose, and it produced about
<br />
30 minutes of strong hallucinations, 20 minutes of weaker
<br />
hallucinations, and another 30 minutes of &quot;day dream&quot; type experiences
<br />
as I was coming out of it.
<br />
<br />I tried another dose on saturday, and the effect was much different.
<br />
I was watching a psychodelic computer screensaver, which resulted in a
<br />
less &quot;dream-like&quot; and more strange experience.  This time I also took
<br />
a &quot;Very Strong&quot; dose, which lasted a bit longer on all stages, but I'm
<br />
not sure what impact it had otherwise.
<br />
<br />I was back in Arkansas in the 1970's again.  But there was a much
<br />
stronger feeling that something important was about to happen, and
<br />
that I was part of the plan.  ALSO, I wasn't a kid this time.  There
<br />
was a much stronger (but intermittent) feeling of being &quot;someone
<br />
else&quot;.
<br />
<br />I think this may have been related to the amnesia.  I wasn't
<br />
explicitly TRYING to remember something and failing so it wasn't a
<br />
jarring experience, but still there was a lack of implicit &quot;historical
<br />
context&quot; for myself.  This, combined with the unfamiliar sense of
<br />
being on a &quot;mission&quot; (associated with the feeling that something
<br />
important was going to happen) I think made for a feeling of being
<br />
someone else.  It certainly didn't feel like the normal &quot;what it is
<br />
like to be me&quot;, in that my mindset seemed different.
<br />
<br />Also, in an earlier post you mention the &quot;feminine presence&quot;.  I had
<br />
this the second time too.  BUT, the feeling I had was the &quot;she&quot; was
<br />
impatient.  Presumably about the important thing that was going to
<br />
happen.
<br />
<br />The screensaver was mesmerizing though.  I stared at it for the entire
<br />
time.  Over an hour.  It was quite a show.  It didn't stop me from
<br />
seeing other things, related to Arkansas, but it did take up the bulk
<br />
of my &quot;visual experience&quot;.  And, interestingly, it didn't get pulled
<br />
into any of the &quot;story lines&quot; of the dream.  The story-line of the
<br />
dream was entirely seperate.
<br />
<br />As for the metaphysical implications of &quot;identifying the self with
<br />
personal memories&quot;, I'll have to think about that a bit more.
<br />
<br />All good stuff!

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Kelly, and others,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, thanks for your report. Did you smoke the extract? It usually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last for 4 minutes. It is amazing it did last so long with you, I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only one case of an experience lasting 20 minutes. I am happy you found
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your experience interesting. You can consult and discuss your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experience, and those of others here:<a href="http://www.entheogen.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=135">http://www.entheogen.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=135</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now the real question is, does that experience helped in providing, for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, an answer to my last remark to Quentin?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I quote the question again. It is important concerning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comp-immortality, and eventually how to derive physics from computer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; science.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I do think such a question is difficult, and show the weakness in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; identifying the self with personal memories, and this justifies the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessity of the AUDA move, I think.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Of course, if you enjoy dream-state-like, you can enjoy Salvia without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; troubling yourself with hard metaphysical questions. Yet I would be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interesting if Quentin or Stathis, or anyone, could acknowledge a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conceptual difficulty here.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;&lt;Hmmm...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I ask you, and others, this question. What is the probability &quot;now&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that you will find yourself in Washington and Moscow the 24 december
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2009, when you are annihilated in Brussels, now, (17 March 2009) and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reconstituted in both Moscow and Washington the 18 March 2009, say)?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The problem is that the reconstitution machine did dysfunction in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Washington, so that, from the 18 March 2009 up to the 20 Augustus 2009
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you (the you in Washington) suffered a  &quot;total amnesia&quot;.  And then,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;you&quot; recovered slowly and progressively from that through adequate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; medication up to a total recall, the 23 December (and none of yous did
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; move from W or M).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that with high concentrated extract of Salvia Divinorum, people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can &quot;suffer&quot; (or &quot;enjoy&quot;) a total amnesia, where you forget not just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your name and memories of life, but you forget even what is a person,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what is space, what is time.  Yet you remain conscious. Life appears as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a dream, that you recall vaguely, and then forget, and then you forget
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you did that dream. Yet &quot;you&quot; come back. (See the reports, I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encourage its consumption, but anyone interested by consciousness can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be interested by such reports).&gt;&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I tried Salvia for the first time yesterday.  Very similar to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dreaming, but more intense, with a lot more sounds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; At first I thought, &quot;Nothing's happening&quot;.  Then I thought, &quot;I seem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be about to slide sidewise...I need to stop&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Then, I was sitting somewhere...in a tilled field I think, and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; couldn't remember who I was.  Then I thought, someone's going to be in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; trouble...I need to tell my sister.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Then, for the next 30 minutes it was 1978, and I was in Arkansas, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I was a kid again.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Every now and then I'd think, &quot;What's going on???  Did I take
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something?&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But I could never remember for sure.  A couple of times I would think
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the Salvia extract, but I couldn't remember if it was just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; something I'd heard of, or if I'd actually used it.  And I'd decide,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; &quot;Nah, couldn't be salvia...reality doesn't work that way.  That would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; be like magic.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; After about 30 minutes of dreaming it was 1978, and I was 7, and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Arkansas,  I came to enough to look at the clock, and I remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thinking, &quot;It didn't work...&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; THEN, I was underwater looking up towards the surface, and there was a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; giant squid passing over me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; About 20 minutes later, I got up and starting writing up what I'd
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seen, but I was still drifting in and out, like I was having day-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; dreams.  And they were still about Arkansas 1978, but it was like I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; was there, and there was a plan, and I was part of it.  Something was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; about to happen, and I was like part of a group that knew about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Over the next hour the day-dreams stopped, and within 2 hours of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; starting it was over.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Very interesting.
