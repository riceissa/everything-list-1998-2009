<br /><br />Chapter 1
<br />
<br />Introduction
<br />
<br />The mind returns to itself like a glove – Buddhist proverb
<br />
<br />Mr Edgar Morin, president of the jury on Le Monde 1998’s University  
<br />
Research Prize, commended the laureates, I amongst them, seeing the  
<br />
happy fortune of our doctoral theses published chez Grasset, that we  
<br />
should have no hesitation in adopting a presentation bearing full  
<br />
witness to the human and personal aspect - all of which decided me to  
<br />
relate it’s entire history.
<br />
<br />I should recognise the somewhat special character of the result, but  
<br />
also, and perhaps especially, because of the nature of the path  
<br />
undertaken. I brought up the question of the work’s basis for the  
<br />
first time in 1963, at a school in Brussels. I was eight years old: I  
<br />
do not know if I was particularly precocious or merely highly-strung.  
<br />
In effect the motivation for this work and, for the research toward it  
<br />
commencing in infancy, has always been linked to a fear of death.
<br />
<br />There are other more fundamental reasons for my describing this  
<br />
unfolding path, an essential part of which is situated in my earliest  
<br />
infancy:
<br />
<br />1.     The work is essentially multidisciplinary. It is situated at  
<br />
the intersection of numerous disciplines – theology, psychology,  
<br />
biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, information technology –  
<br />
and, suddenly, it is difficult to know with what to begin. Bearing  
<br />
this in mind, the way of kids’ questions is particularly fit for the  
<br />
purpose.
<br />
<br />2.     I questioned myself, but rapidly began wondering where the  
<br />
questions came from; a good part of the thesis rests on a process of  
<br />
self-observation. We will see how the thesis is naturally self- 
<br />
explanatory, how it explains its own genesis. An aspect made clearer  
<br />
if one follows, even if only briefly, the path of the kiddies’  
<br />
questions. I myself profited thereby and ended up with a more polished  
<br />
version of the principal argument. There is no attempt at dumbing-down  
<br />
and the reader can skip any passages judged too technical.
<br />
<br />3.     The opportunity to do justice and homage to the great authors  
<br />
and books that stake out my quest, amongst them: G. Ames &amp; R. Wyler,  
<br />
James Watson, Linus Pauling, Michel-Yves Bernard, Lewis Carroll, E.  
<br />
Nagel &amp; J.R. Newman, Jean Ladrière, S.C. Kleene, Bernard d’Espagnat.
<br />
<br />4.     …and to recount a Belgian in the best, or universal story in  
<br />
the worst of cases, nothing at all of which is very funny. This story  
<br />
explains why I defended my thesis in 1998 in France. I shall recount  
<br />
these events without hatred or spirit of revenge.
<br />
<br />I will tell you in several words even now, the principal result. To  
<br />
begin with, the work presents a proof, which is to say a deductive or,  
<br />
to use heavier terminology, a hypothetico-deductive argument. This  
<br />
signifies there is a hypothesis as much as a “thesis”, in the more  
<br />
technical sense of what is demonstrated from this hypothesis.
<br />
<br />By way of proof, I expect that if the reader is not fully convinced of  
<br />
the result after study of the work, he should put up either a non- 
<br />
justified proposition or an error. Note that, concerning deductive  
<br />
work, conclusions never officially carry over to reality. Scientific  
<br />
proofs operate inside the frame of a postulated theory. Science is  
<br />
thus always modest on the subject of its applicability to or its  
<br />
approximation to the real.
<br />
<br />The hypothesis is that of Mechanism: the idea that we could be digital  
<br />
machines, in a sense that will be rendered more clearly in due course.  
<br />
Grossly speaking, we would be machines in the precise sense that no  
<br />
parts of our bodies are privileged with respect to an eventual  
<br />
functional substitution: this says that we can survive a heart  
<br />
substitution by the transplant of an artificial heart, or of a kidney  
<br />
by an artificial kidney, etc., inasmuch as the substitution is carried  
<br />
out at a sufficiently fine level. Neither can there be any constraints  
<br />
imposed on the level of substitution chosen. It’s important to  
<br />
remember that I am not going to defend the hypothesis of Mechanism. I  
<br />
only want to pose this hypothesis at the outset. It constitutes the  
<br />
predefined frame of the work1 [footnote 1]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 1: Note that the idea of taking Mechanism or  
<br />
Computationalism as a hypothesis seems to be, rather curiously,  
<br />
original. Since Descartes (and even before, notably among the Hindu  
<br />
logicians), there is a staggering amount of literature surrounding the  
<br />
question of Mechanism and the mind, but it is always a question of  
<br />
arguments in favour of Mechanism or arguments against it. Many also  
<br />
think that Mechanism is by itself a solution to the mind-body problem.  
<br />
This, I hope is a strong suit of the current work, to show that  
<br />
Mechanism does not automatically resolve the mind-body problem. On the  
<br />
contrary, it necessitates a reformulation of the problem taking the  
<br />
form of a necessary justification of belief in the appearance of a  
<br />
material world, physical or substantial (to anticipate in one phrase  
<br />
the principal result of the work.)]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />The discovery described here is that in this case, that with this  
<br />
hypothesis of Mechanism, physics becomes reducible to the psychology  
<br />
of machines. The “of” should be interpreted in both the transitive  
<br />
and intransitive senses: clearly it is a question of psychology  
<br />
concerning machines as much as psychology inferred or postulated  
<br />
correctly (by definition) by the machines themselves. We will be able,  
<br />
with a little information theory, to define this psychology in the  
<br />
wider sense of the machines’ “self-referentially correct”  
<br />
discourse. Such a psychology appears non-normative: we will see that  
<br />
it makes of us beings vastly less well known to ourselves than we had  
<br />
ever imagined. It constitutes a sort of “vaccine” against the  
<br />
numerous forms of reductionism of human psychology.
<br />
<br />The reduction of physics to psychology happens also at the  
<br />
epistemological level: physics effectively becomes a branch of  
<br />
psychology – the science of observable machines – as it does at the  
<br />
ontological level: matter or the appearance of matter emerges from  
<br />
consciousness, from the mind or the mental or even as we will see, of  
<br />
“possible gambles” made by all digital machines.
<br />
<br />It seems that what I have succeeded in demonstrating is that to truly  
<br />
take seriously the hypothesis that we are digitalisable machines, is  
<br />
to be forced to recognise a reversal of the naturalist or materialist  
<br />
idea, quite widespread among philosophers, physicians and the man in  
<br />
the street, that physics is the fundamental science to which all the  
<br />
other natural and human sciences - at least ontologically and thus in  
<br />
principle - should be reducible. I summarise this theorem by:
<br />
<br />comp  ⇒  reversal
<br />
<br />where comp designates “computationalism”, a name often given to  
<br />
“Digital Mechanism” and reversal designates the reversal of  
<br />
psychology with physics. What results is not a primitive matter with  
<br />
consciousness emerging from the organisation of the matter but the  
<br />
reverse: consciousness is now the more primitive and matter, or rather  
<br />
the appearance of material organisation, emerges from all the possible  
<br />
experiences of all the possible consciousnesses; and this in a  
<br />
sufficiently precise sense that derives physics (science of matter)  
<br />
from psychology (viewed as a very general science of conscious  
<br />
experience, or more positively, of stable discourses by the machines  
<br />
themselves: physics, but not geography2, belonging necessarily to this  
<br />
self-referential discourse, which I will demonstrate.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 2: Physics becomes the study of what is a priori observable  
<br />
by every observer. The moon’s existence is not (in all truthfulness)  
<br />
a physical law. By now one might fear that the physical laws lead only  
<br />
to trivial truths, but we will see that the constraints of Mechanism  
<br />
detrivialise this introspective physics.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, anyone who for any good reason were to be persuaded  
<br />
of the veracity of contemporary materialism3, can always surmise that  
<br />
the present work constitutes a rejection of Mechanism. This will  
<br />
nevertheless pose a problem since Mechanism is, implicitly or  
<br />
explicitly, the philosophy adopted by the majority of materialists.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 3: Throughout this work, “materialism” will be taken in  
<br />
the weak sense of the philosophical doctrine that postulates the  
<br />
existence of a substantial universe (a fact of things obeying laws  
<br />
independent of us).]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Concerning my own position on this I remain silent. My philosophical  
<br />
opinions rest and will remain private. In the more technical part of  
<br />
the thesis I nevertheless show that one can already extract enough  
<br />
qualitative and quantitative givens from physics once this is shown to  
<br />
be derivable from machine psychology. We can then confront the results  
<br />
with the usual empirical and modern physical theories – notably  
<br />
quantum mechanics – to start to see an empirical confirmation of this  
<br />
psychology and thus confirmation of the reversal.
<br />
<br />By illuminating problems in the interpretation of (quantum) physical  
<br />
facts, this thesis vehiculates a de facto judgement: the judgement  
<br />
that the reversal and Mechanism, its reasoning logic, are plausible.
<br />
<br />A final observation concerns rationalism and interdisciplinarity.
<br />
<br />This work pleads as “rationalist”. Like Karl Popper, I appreciate  
<br />
the match between rationalism and elitism. Rationalism is a form of  
<br />
hope concerning the reasoning powers of others. It is the hope that  
<br />
the other will have the courtesy to listen to you and accept your  
<br />
results or to indicate to you your errors, or to say to you at the  
<br />
very least that the subject is of no interest to him. Popper writes:
<br />
<br />Faith4 in reason is not only a faith in our own reason but also – and  
<br />
even more – in that of others.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 4: French translation of Popper quote suppressed.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Thus a rationalist, even if he believes himself to be intellectually  
<br />
superior to others, will reject all claims to authority since he is  
<br />
aware that, if his intelligence is superior to that of others (which  
<br />
is hard for him to judge), it is only insofar as he is capable of  
<br />
learning from his own and other peoples’ mistakes, and that one can  
<br />
learn in this sense only if one takes others and their arguments  
<br />
seriously. Rationalism is therefore bound up with the idea that the  
<br />
other fellow has the right to be heard, and to defend his arguments.  
<br />
(Karl R. Popper5)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 5: The Open Society and Its Enemies. London, Hutchinson, 1950]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I feel in particular, that reason is a universal and, universally  
<br />
profitable. Nothing else like science exists that is clearly separate  
<br />
to all other human endeavours. I merely believe that there are those  
<br />
possessed of a scientific attitude, which is no more than a form of  
<br />
modesty and honesty with themselves and with others. This attitude  
<br />
does not depend on any particular domain. I have a ready-made slogan:
<br />
<br />Some gardeners are more scientific than astronomers
<br />
<br />And, I might have said astrologers in place of gardeners6.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 6: One can consult a fine book by Suzanne Blackmore In  
<br />
Search of the Light for an example of a scientific contribution to  
<br />
parapsychology, albeit somewhat negative.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Today a kind of artificial chasm is maintained between the human  
<br />
sciences and the exact sciences. To combat the so-called elitist usage  
<br />
of mathematics, a minister of politics7 was struck by the notion of  
<br />
suppressing numerous hours devoted to maths in diverse sections of  
<br />
secondary teaching.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 7: This idea was defended by Claude Allègre, explored in his  
<br />
book The Defeat of Plato (Fayard, Paris, 1995) and applied when he  
<br />
ascended to the post of Education minister.)]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />In the same way, more and more hours of maths teaching are being taken  
<br />
away from the human sciences. This can only finish by discouraging  
<br />
teachers from teaching by demonstration – meaning explanations – of  
<br />
formulas in mathematics courses. One would presumably do the opposite,  
<br />
short of teaching other mathematics in the human sections.
<br />
<br />The prohibition on the generalised use of deductive or interrogative  
<br />
reason, and on mathematics itself, contributes not only to rendering  
<br />
the human sciences less exact and the exact sciences less human, but  
<br />
also especially to rendering the human sciences less human and the  
<br />
exact sciences less exact, as should be clear from a reading of the  
<br />
present work.
<br />
<br />Note that I do not claim that reason is everything, or that it is a  
<br />
kind of universal panacea. I only say that reason, properly  
<br />
considered, should stand as the first rung of courtesy, permitting  
<br />
evolution and progress in the research of knowledge. Short of making  
<br />
courageous “backflips” from time to time, as in revising one’s  
<br />
beliefs or abandoning a prejudice, this is how things should be.
<br />
<br />Reason is not sufficient for progress in knowledge. There must also be  
<br />
inspiration, attention, imagination, bravery etc. While reason is not  
<br />
of itself sufficient, it is necessary to communicate results to others.
<br />
<br />Again concerning interdisciplinarity,  I often like to cite Descartes.  
<br />
He wrote:
<br />
<br />One must therefore be convinced that all the sciences are so linked  
<br />
together that it is easier to learn them all at the same time, than to  
<br />
isolate each from the other.
<br />
<br />I hope that the present contribution will illustrate to what extent  
<br />
Descartes was inspired on this point. As with the collaborations on  
<br />
quantum mechanics of Einstein, Podolski and Rosen on the one hand, and  
<br />
of Bell on the other, this work should also illustrate the artificial  
<br />
character of the frontier between science and philosophy, or even  
<br />
between science and theology. We will return to this point.
<br />
<br />Any traces of eventual frontiers existing between the sciences and the  
<br />
philosophies rest ultimately on philosophical postulates, avowed or not.
<br />
<br />The advantage in my briefly recounting to you the pathways taken by my  
<br />
still-young thoughts, lies in the fact that children are naturally  
<br />
interdisciplinary: they have not yet submitted to that form of  
<br />
brainwashing known as “academic specialisation”. Children will  
<br />
always pose questions without fear of where they might be putting  
<br />
their feet.

<br /><br />Chapter 2
<br />
<br />The Amoeba’s Secret
<br />
<br />(1961 → 1971)
<br />
<br />what am I doing here in these miasmas
<br />
<br />tiny little Lilliputian
<br />
<br />seized by terror, sometimes by asthma
<br />
<br />before these tonnes of thingumajigs
<br />
<br />Gaston Compère, “Geometrie de l’absence”
<br />
<br /><br /><br />What follows evidently constitutes a partial view of the past. I am  
<br />
not telling my life-story, merely those sparse events that illustrate  
<br />
the threading of the ideas and questions that together form the origin  
<br />
of the discovery.
<br />
<br />Certain paediatricians claim that the first metaphysical crisis, or  
<br />
the first anxious moments concerning death, occur in children around  
<br />
age 4. Perhaps. I remember well the terror that invaded my mind day  
<br />
and night, and I demanded all manner of assurances from my parents  
<br />
that I would wake up the following morning.
<br />
<br />With the well-intentioned care of silencing any woes in children,  
<br />
parents are apt to tell stories. As I was born in Germany, a nanny  
<br />
would regularly read to me in German many folk-tales, mainly those of  
<br />
the brothers Grimm, although I am not so certain that these offered me  
<br />
any appeasement concerning my worries.
<br />
<br />It must have been at around the age of 5 or 6 when as I remember,  
<br />
doubtless by a sort of absent-mindedness or simply out of fatigue  
<br />
since I assailed him with questions remorselessly, that my father  
<br />
informed me that Saint Nicholas did not exist.
<br />
<br />“And Father Christmas?”
<br />
<br />“Him neither” my father replied, sadly noting my incredulous and  
<br />
king-hit countenance. Thus collapsed my first theory – or ontology,  
<br />
mythology, theology, belief, dream…call it what you will; at this  
<br />
age, any precision on my part had been premature.
<br />
<br />“And the fairies?” I pleaded.
<br />
<br />“Them neither”
<br />
<br />“But, come on – the angels and all that…?”
<br />
<br />Here I could see that I had come once again to pose my father an  
<br />
embarrassing question. After a long drawn-out sigh, he explained to me  
<br />
that really he believed in none of it – in angels or in God, but that  
<br />
my cousins and uncles and aunts believed it all. This astonished me  
<br />
all the more in that fairies were for me no more than female angels  
<br />
equipped with magic wands. I liked fairies and angels because they  
<br />
could fly (had I gone on to develop this tendency I might have become  
<br />
an aviator), but in the main because fairies and angels were immortals.
<br />
<br />By now I had realised that adults could have differing beliefs. I  
<br />
found this profoundly shocking. If my cousins could believe in angels,  
<br />
was it not my right to also believe in them, as well as in fairies?
<br />
<br />My father explained to me that it was surely my right after a certain  
<br />
fashion, to believe in whatever I wanted to believe, but that it was  
<br />
by no means evident that to do so would be in my best interest.
<br />
<br />To believe in false propositions is to invite deception and  
<br />
disappointment. I found entirely pathetic the notion of believing in  
<br />
the false, and the whole thing gave me the shudders. From this moment  
<br />
on, I would try to adhere to the rule: avoid at any price belief in  
<br />
falsity.
<br />
<br />The truth, evidently, can give rise to fear. In particular the idea  
<br />
that I was a mere mortal seemed to me to be at the very limits of the  
<br />
acceptable. But the idea of believing in falsity out of fear of the  
<br />
truth worried me all the more. I therefore made promise to myself to  
<br />
always search for the true, fearsome as this may well turn out to be.  
<br />
To know would seem even better.
<br />
<br />To know is better: agreed. But is this even possible? Surely it cannot  
<br />
be easy.
<br />
<br />To start with, I observed that during nightly dreams I was able to  
<br />
believe in just about any falsity. In addition, I suffered sleep  
<br />
problems, like many kids, something confirmed by  
<br />
electroencephalography. My dreams were abnormally realistic. This  
<br />
hyperrealism was fine in the case of lovely and pleasant dreams, but  
<br />
it became truly worrisome in the case of strange dreams and  
<br />
nightmares. Doubts arising from dreams, even concerning the  
<br />
possibility of knowing truth, will play a role in the story that  
<br />
occupies us here. There is nothing original in any of this; the  
<br />
metaphysical role of dreams appeared with the Hindu idealists, Plato,  
<br />
Descartes, Berkeley, as I would learn later on.
<br />
<br />There followed the problem of a divergence of opinion between my  
<br />
father and my uncle. Before, everything was simple: a proposal was  
<br />
true if and only if my father asserted it1.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 1: I express myself here in adult language; at the time I  
<br />
would have been hard-pressed to formulate such a proposal in this way.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Since he had evinced several seconds of doubt over the existence of  
<br />
angels and told me that my uncle himself believed in them, I truly  
<br />
wondered just whom I should believe over this.
<br />
<br />I asked my uncle why he believed in angels. He replied, inasmuch as I  
<br />
can recall with any precision, that his belief was based in the fact  
<br />
that his parents believed in them, also his grandparents, etc. I found  
<br />
his reply frankly troubling. In effect, if his ancestor had been  
<br />
mistaken, this mistake would be propagated from generation to  
<br />
generation. I came to admire my father’s placing in doubt his own  
<br />
parents’ beliefs, and I decided to never believe in a proposition  
<br />
under simple pretext that it had been announced by a trusted person or  
<br />
family-member. I had hit upon what one now calls the principle of  
<br />
Independent will, a founding principle of the Independent University  
<br />
of Brussels, the university where my father concluded his juristic  
<br />
studies after a learning spell with the Jesuits. I have no doubt that  
<br />
he may have influenced me.
<br />
<br />I asked my father why he did not believe in angels and fairies (I  
<br />
could not have cared less about St Nicholas and Father Christmas  
<br />
because to my mind they were not even immortals). He responded by  
<br />
saying that having thoroughly searched everywhere, no one had  
<br />
encountered them anywhere. There followed a deluge of revelations: we  
<br />
live on a ball suspended in space, we have already orbited it etc. It  
<br />
seemed like no place existed for fairies and angels.
<br />
<br />In order to not run the risk of believing falsity, my interest in  
<br />
imaginary beings slid over to a pronounced interest in animals, for  
<br />
whose existence nobody had even the slightest doubt. Returning to  
<br />
Belgium from Germany, my parents bought a small hobby-farm in the  
<br />
country to which we would go during vacations and on the weekend. I  
<br />
passed a lot of time observing swallows, butterflies, ants etc. When  
<br />
observing an animal, for example, a butterfly, I identified body and  
<br />
soul with this butterfly. If it flew, it was I who flew, if it  
<br />
gathered pollen, it was I who gathered pollen and it was I who became  
<br />
intoxicated by the multiple nectars of the flowers of the fields.
<br />
<br />One day, I pointed to a white butterfly and exclaimed to my sister and  
<br />
brother “Look! This butterfly, I recognise it, it’s me; I have been  
<br />
this butterfly for several weeks now.” And they, with a delicacy well  
<br />
known amongst siblings, broke the news to me that this was not  
<br />
possible “because butterflies only live for one day.”
<br />
<br />This came as quite a shock. It reminded me that if swallows and  
<br />
butterflies flew, like angels, they were none the less mortal for it,  
<br />
like me. They did seem though, to live a much shorter life than I,  
<br />
which I found disturbing.
<br />
<br />At this time, whenever I identified with an animal, the identification  
<br />
took place in real time: I did not yet imagine from the butterfly’s  
<br />
point of view that one day could appear very long. Thus, if a  
<br />
butterfly truly lived but one day, due to my identification with it, I  
<br />
also lived but one day and no longer. And this was no laughing matter.  
<br />
I became maniacally obsessed with the maximum life spans of animals.  
<br />
Every time I heard of a new animal I would ask about its longevity. I  
<br />
was rather disappointed to discover that, on the whole, large animals  
<br />
lived longer than the small ones with which I had been identifying  
<br />
almost exclusively since I myself was of small stature at this time.
<br />
<br />It was then that I made an authentic and revolutionary discovery. I  
<br />
had a canine companion in whom I confided my metaphysical concerns, my  
<br />
partner in the quest for truth. One fine day, I tried to show him a  
<br />
tiny red spider (in fact a tiny garden acarina), without managing to  
<br />
attract his attention. I concluded that the acarina was too tiny for  
<br />
my dog to see and suddenly, I found myself identifying with my dog. It  
<br />
thus came into my mind that the fairies and angels were perhaps just  
<br />
that little bit too miniscule for us to be able to perceive them.
<br />
<br />As quickly as I could, I presented my theory to my father. I was  
<br />
particularly serene, not only in view of a proof of the existence of  
<br />
fairies, but also of the proof that my father could not be sure of  
<br />
their non-existence. I played devil’s advocate not because I wanted  
<br />
to contradict my father at any price, but rather to show that my  
<br />
cousins and uncle were perhaps not entirely in the wrong.
<br />
<br />“Even if you searched everywhere on Earth for angels and didn’t  
<br />
find any, that proves nothing” I said. “Perhaps angels and fairies  
<br />
are simply too small for us to see them?” I explained to him the  
<br />
experience with my dog. My father, who had an answer to hand for  
<br />
everything, enlightened me that the search had included the direction  
<br />
of the tiny as well. He spoke to me of the microscope and – and in  
<br />
fact it was this that surprised me the most - he explained that the  
<br />
effective discovery of a multitude of tiny animals invisible to the  
<br />
naked eye had thereby been made. He then took a piece of paper and  
<br />
drew a sketch of an amoeba. I fell headlong in love with this tiny and  
<br />
adorable creature, multiform and so easy to draw.
<br />
<br />And so to the fundamental question of the moment: how long might an  
<br />
amoeba expect to live?
<br />
<br />Considering my belief that the smaller an animal was, the less time it  
<br />
could live, I hardly had any illusions. It must be that my tiny amoeba  
<br />
could not possibly live very long at all.
<br />
<br />On this question of the lifetime of an amoeba, my father, with  
<br />
infinite wisdom, contented himself to explain that having eaten their  
<br />
fill of even tinier (!) creatures during a day, rather than merely  
<br />
dying like any ordinary beast such as a butterfly, it divided itself  
<br />
instead into two. Instead of dying and disappearing, an amoeba would  
<br />
divide itself and give birth to two amoebas. This was practically the  
<br />
reverse of death itself.
<br />
<br />“So they’re immortal, then?”
<br />
<br />This time, my father made no response.
<br />
<br />I requested, of my elder brother and sister notably, that they bring  
<br />
back from school as many documents as they could find on amoebas,  
<br />
which they very kindly did. I thus started to write (more exactly, to  
<br />
scribble in just about every sense) a book: The Invisible World. My  
<br />
idea was that if invisible worlds existed – and the existence of the  
<br />
amoeba proved the existence of such worlds – one could no longer  
<br />
enjoy any form of certainty over whatever the case might be. In the  
<br />
final analysis, my uncle may well have been right on the subject of  
<br />
angels. The amoeba was surely a tangible piece of evidence that at  
<br />
least certain animals could be immortal. I killed time by annoying my  
<br />
parents with the demand for a microscope of my own. When the  
<br />
microscope inevitably arrived, I looked for amoebas. I discovered  
<br />
euglenas and especially paramecia, and when they divided themselves  
<br />
into two, I divided into two also. The question now was to know  
<br />
whether the paramecium had survived its division.
<br />
<br />What exactly was going on?
<br />
<br />I arrived at my first public seminar on amoebas. Even though I may be  
<br />
driven by self-imposed questions, I have always had an immense  
<br />
enthusiasm for giving oral exposés, even delivering classes and  
<br />
seminars on subjects at a considerable distance from those that  
<br />
preoccupy me directly. Thus, I had already given several verbal  
<br />
exposés, notably on minerals, but, in 1963, at the age of 8, people  
<br />
were urging me to deliver a seminar on microbes.
<br />
<br />Entitled Amoeba, Euglena and Paramecium, I have managed to rediscover  
<br />
my succinct resumé in an old notebook:
<br />
<br />My friends let me tell you, in this room, we are not 24 in number, but  
<br />
several million2.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 2: I already liked paradoxical propositions; true but  
<br />
slightly astonishing statements, so to speak. “We” to my mind,  
<br />
evidently designated the students of the class with the teacher and  
<br />
the microbes in the class. The “million” would have had to be a  
<br />
much higher number in reality, if one had wanted to be more exact.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Does the elephant see the tiny red spider? Could living beings exist  
<br />
who are so tiny that to us they would be invisible? Could there be an  
<br />
invisible world and a tunnel through which to explore it? As  
<br />
incredible as this may sound: yes. The microscope is the tunnel and  
<br />
the microbes are the discovery. Amoeba, euglena, paramecia,  
<br />
vorticellae, stentor, bacteria, ovum and spermatozoa, the protozoa  
<br />
among us! Nutrition, digestion, excretion, diverse sensibilities (the  
<br />
euglena’s eye), and …. reproduction.
<br />
<br />Question: How long can an amoeba live? One day or forever? If it lives  
<br />
two days it lives every day… forever. (Robert Catteau public  
<br />
secondary school, in the presence of Prof. Verschaeve)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I would become more and more obsessed by this question of the  
<br />
immortality of the amoeba. For the following two full years, I would  
<br />
pass half my free time on walks gathering every possible kind of water  
<br />
(sewerage, liquid manure, pond water, estuarine, puddles of every  
<br />
sort) and the other half observing these waters under the microscope.  
<br />
As usual, I always identified completely with the microorganisms I was  
<br />
observing and attempted to somehow sense whatever was going on at the  
<br />
moment of their division. I scaffolded an unimaginable number of  
<br />
theories illustrating the immortal character of unicellular creatures  
<br />
without arriving at a stage of conviction over any of them. The  
<br />
consistent effort to go from fairies to amoebas had been kick-started  
<br />
by my fear of believing in non-existent things and I did not at any  
<br />
price want to believe that amoebas were immortal if they in fact were  
<br />
not.
<br />
<br />Yet, certitude had come through: IF an amoeba lives two days THEN it  
<br />
lives every day3
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 3: In fact the common amoeba divides on average every 50  
<br />
hours approximately, but for the sake of simplicity I will continue to  
<br />
speak as though its divisions occur every 24 hours.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />It remained to demonstrate that for an amoeba to be immortal, it only  
<br />
needed to survive one division.
<br />
<br />An example of a theory heading in this direction was what I called  
<br />
“The Principle of the Inspector”:
<br />
<br /><br /><br />NO CORPSE means NO MURDER
<br />
<br /><br /><br />According to the inspector, when the amoeba divides, it leaves behind  
<br />
no corpse, so no “body” dies in the act of division, therefore an  
<br />
amoeba survives its division. But this reasoning is invalid. When a  
<br />
hydra eats an amoeba, it gets digested and neither is any corpse left  
<br />
behind. The difficulty lies in believing that it survives the process  
<br />
of digestion. The “Principle of the Inspector” collapsed.
<br />
<br />My basic theory or argument in favour of the immortality of the amoeba  
<br />
or paramecium had been directly linked to the experiment of swapping  
<br />
places with a concrete paramecium and keenly observing it through a  
<br />
microscope. Evidently I had come up against a problem of scale. It  
<br />
seems that I go from one to two but how is this possible? Which is the  
<br />
original paramecium between the two new ones? Both or only one of  
<br />
them? Which one?
<br />
<br />In particular, if I become one of the two paramecia, how could I  
<br />
convince the other, given that it could just as easily make the claim  
<br />
of being me?
<br />
<br />Completely gobsmacked by this, given over to a sort of semi-ecstatic  
<br />
vertigo I realised something just as extraordinary and incommunicable.
<br />
<br />My feeling had been that the amoeba survived its division (and thus  
<br />
every division, meaning that it was immortal) but as it had become  
<br />
two, each of the two resulting amoebas were unable to convince the  
<br />
other that it had survived, where “it” referred to the original  
<br />
amoeba. From whence arose the incommunicability.
<br />
<br />If an amoeba could not bring any of its copies to accept its survival  
<br />
or its immortality, how much more difficult might it be to convince a  
<br />
human being?
<br />
<br />How difficult might it be for me to convince another human of the  
<br />
immortality of an amoeba even if immortality were an accepted notion?  
<br />
The more I reflected on this, the more it seemed to me that this  
<br />
immortality, if immortality it was, must be condemned to remain  
<br />
forever secret. This explained to my satisfaction the prudent silence  
<br />
of my father.
<br />
<br />A spectacular confirmation would arrive when I was given The Marvels  
<br />
of Life, the very fine book by Ames &amp; Wyler with a preface by Jean  
<br />
Rostand and superb illustrations by Charles Harper – it was also the  
<br />
first book I ever took to bed and slept with!
<br />
<br />This book contained an entire chapter consecrated to the amoeba.  
<br />
Distraught by the toll of new information it contained, I initially  
<br />
believed that it would not get down to the question of the immortality  
<br />
of protozoa, but one day, I fell upon the photo of a paramecium for  
<br />
which the legend was “Is the paramecium immortal?” I quickly felt  
<br />
relieved because I could see that one could at least pose this  
<br />
question. Soon thereafter I felt astonished: “here, finally is a book  
<br />
that addresses an enormous number of questions and is content to pose  
<br />
the question”. This astonishment was given legs by the confirmation  
<br />
that the immortality of the paramecium, if immortality exists, could  
<br />
be no more than a necessary interrogation: a wager on uncommunicable  
<br />
success.
<br />
<br />Ames and Wyler were just as prudent as my dad. I wondered if I was  
<br />
going to succeed at being just as prudent as them. What rotten luck  
<br />
all the same: I discover a fundamental truth and it seems forbidden to  
<br />
communicate it. I would have to wait until 1971 to get out of this  
<br />
impasse and to weigh up the communicable as per the uncommunicable  
<br />
parts of the amoeba’s secret.
<br />
<br />It is noteworthy that up until this time, I had never asked what an  
<br />
amoeba was made of, or what I myself was made of. It seemed to me that  
<br />
the question did not truly depend on whatever things were made of. I  
<br />
did not imagine myself as made of something(s). The problem of  
<br />
immortality seemed to me to be more a question of biology, or of  
<br />
psychology, or of theology - not a question of physics. The matter did  
<br />
not rest there either in that I demanded to know how an amoeba managed  
<br />
to divide itself into two. Moreover, the argument in favour of the  
<br />
amoeba’s immortality on one hand and especially the incommunicability  
<br />
of this immortality by the amoeba on the other hand, depended  
<br />
crucially on the fact that after the division, the two resulting  
<br />
amoebas were rigorously identical, since only in this case did the two  
<br />
amoebas seem to contradict one another in claiming to have survived,  
<br />
one, each!
<br />
<br />The reading of Ames &amp; Wyler, accompanied by books of Jean Rostand  
<br />
passed to me by my father as well as some excellent manuals of Jean- 
<br />
Pierre Vanden Eeckhoudt – teacher at the Robert Catteau Public School  
<br />
– would drive me from astonishment to astonishment. There, I learnt  
<br />
the magic words that described the principal phases of cellular  
<br />
division: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase; as well as their  
<br />
significance in chromosomal terms. I learnt especially that I am  
<br />
myself constituted from a colony of social amoebas! Our pluricellular  
<br />
organic quality posed me problems: how could I as a society of amoebas  
<br />
still identify with an individual amoeba? Unless an amoeba itself were  
<br />
in turn a colony of sub-microbes, and so on and so forth? I was thus  
<br />
led naturally to an interest in chemistry and to atomic physics.
<br />
<br />On the subject of matter, I would pose myself a question that would  
<br />
prevent me from truly taking seriously the idea of the atom, to say  
<br />
nothing of the very notion of matter itself. Initially, I imagined  
<br />
atoms to be ultra-smooth and ultra-hard spheres; next I learnt that  
<br />
atoms were in fact constituted of electrons spinning around a nucleus  
<br />
of protons and neutrons that I imagined were in their turn, like ultra- 
<br />
smooth and ultra-hard spheres. It seemed that you could always divide  
<br />
matter and that research to find the ultimate particle was all in  
<br />
vain. At the same time however, if one were to find an ultimate  
<br />
particle, it seemed to me, what could it possibly be other than a  
<br />
smooth and ultra-hard sphere once again, and what could such a sphere  
<br />
be made of?
<br />
<br />The very idea of matter seemed to me to be void of any explanatory  
<br />
capacity? To me, the notion of matter seemed to bring out more  
<br />
questions than it did answers and seemed to threaten perhaps, the  
<br />
unity of the amoeba.
<br />
<br />It was in the volume by Joël de Rosnay that I learnt of the existence  
<br />
of DNA4, the gigantic molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid which is a  
<br />
long chain in the form of a double helix “like the inside of a  
<br />
certain castle of the Loire”, comprising the repetition of molecules  
<br />
taken from the group {Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine} resulting  
<br />
in a very long “word” in the genre of AATGGCTATGGACCTCAG….and it  
<br />
was in this book that I would learn how this word, seen as a suite of  
<br />
triplets AAT GGC TAT GGA CCT CAG…. is translated into RNA, another  
<br />
nucleic acid, itself translated into a “word”: proteins, comprising  
<br />
tiny molecules, amino acids, chosen from the alphabet of 20 “amino  
<br />
acids”. I would learn how these proteins and their enzymes coped with  
<br />
the rest: from the synthesis of tiny molecules (amino acids,  
<br />
nucleotides, sugars), even right up to the constitution of the cell.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 4: Of course Ames &amp; Wyler also speak of this, but I had no  
<br />
real understanding of what was in question. More and more, my Ames &amp;  
<br />
Wyler opened automatically to the little chapter consecrated to the  
<br />
amoeba!]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;All the same, this gave oxygen to more questions. How did we know  
<br />
all this? What, indeed is a molecule?
<br />
<br />In fact my “Joël de Rosnay” and the review Science &amp; Life, was a  
<br />
springboard for the book destined to become my basic bible for the  
<br />
following years (1968 and thereafter): the French edition, edited by  
<br />
François Gros and prefaced by François Jacob of James D. Watson’s  
<br />
The Molecular Biology of the Gene. In this book, I would gain a  
<br />
glimpse of the incredible molecular dance that goes on, not only with  
<br />
the amoeba, but also with an even tinier creature: the bacterium  
<br />
Escherichia Coli.
<br />
<br />My “Watson” was so biblical that in my vocabulary, the very word  
<br />
“Watson” had become synonymous with THE Bible. In retrospect, my  
<br />
“Ames &amp; Wyler” had been my first Watson, but at the age at which I  
<br />
read it, I believe that I did not pose questions in the genre of  
<br />
knowing who might have written a book.
<br />
<br />Even though The Molecular Biology of the Gene enjoyed pride of place  
<br />
as the Watson, another Watson rapidly outflanked it: General Chemistry  
<br />
by Linus Pauling, and this augmented a bitter conflict in my mind,  
<br />
destined also to endure through the years to come.
<br />
<br />On the one hand, my Watson gave me the impression of a wonderful  
<br />
molecular dance perfectly encoded by RNA and decoded by the cell. This  
<br />
allowed me to see the essential machinery, wherein each molecule’s  
<br />
identity made no contribution to the identity of the whole organism.  
<br />
All of this being accounted for, it now made sense to say that the  
<br />
amoeba, repeating in a fashion much more complicated, though in  
<br />
principle similar to the molecular dance of bacteria, reproduced  
<br />
itself mechanically. I was able to observe, through molecular  
<br />
genetics, an implementation5 of a solution to the problem of knowing  
<br />
how an amoeba could manufacture another amoeba identical to itself.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 5: a representation in terms of data; also known as an  
<br />
“implantation”]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Concerning the lifetime of an amoeba, this proceeded in the direction  
<br />
of an amoeba’s survival of its duplication (a high-fidelity  
<br />
reproduction). Thus, given the “basic theory” investigated in  
<br />
19636, an amoeba is immortal.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 6: An amoeba lives one day or every day. Otherwise put: if  
<br />
an amoeba lives for two days it lives forever. Or again: if an amoeba  
<br />
survives one of its cellular divisions, it survives every one of its  
<br />
cellular divisions.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />This is truly independent of the fact that the amoeba cannot  
<br />
communicate this, and just as independent of the fact that “I”  
<br />
cannot communicate it either.
<br />
<br />My Linus Pauling was a kind of concrete proof that I was somehow  
<br />
forbidden to relate the truth about the amoeba’s immortality. Watson  
<br />
said, “Cells obey the laws of chemistry”. To be sure of the truly  
<br />
“machine-like” - discretely causal if you will (I had yet no  
<br />
concept of the digital or the numerical) - character of self- 
<br />
reproduction, it was imperative that I assure myself of the discrete  
<br />
and machine-like profile of the activity of molecules themselves.
<br />
<br />Now, if Linus Pauling abounded along the lines of the discrete aspect,  
<br />
with quantification by nature’s chemical properties, including atoms  
<br />
and distinct energy levels – all seemed to rest on mathematics,  
<br />
perhaps even on the real numbers; on the continuous, the differential  
<br />
equations. How about that! What was I dealing with?
<br />
<br />The conflict between Linus Pauling and Watson was for me a truly  
<br />
palpable war of ideas, which took on major proportions at the onset of  
<br />
the student vacation. As always, and to my lasting joy, we headed off  
<br />
to the countryside, and the question loomed: do I take Watson or do I  
<br />
take Pauling? I knew full well that if I took both I would pass the  
<br />
entire vacation vacillating between them. As it was during the school  
<br />
year, I would dissipate my time by continually flicking pages in the  
<br />
one and in the other without deciding on anything and remaining stuck  
<br />
in an abyss of perplexities.
<br />
<br />This progressed to the point of reading other authors’ works, the  
<br />
“non-Watson” literary genre, in a range comprising the diaries of  
<br />
Tintin and Spirou on which I was fixated, whodunnits, Freud, Young,  
<br />
Ionesco, Borgès. There was even a certain Alice in Wonderland with  
<br />
which I became bored to death and though I gave up on it halfway, I  
<br />
would nevertheless return to it later on.
<br />
<br />During this whole time, I had kept my taste for oral exposés. In  
<br />
Biology class at high school, I constructed an exposé on “the  
<br />
lactose operon” (results due to Jacob and Monod in bacterial  
<br />
genetics). Though I had not finished my talk, the teacher let me  
<br />
continue the following hour and again the following hour etc. In the  
<br />
end, he allowed me to have my say during several weeks. One day, the  
<br />
teacher summarised my exposé. This had evolved into a small  
<br />
introduction to molecular biology and during this, he committed a  
<br />
negligible error. Always careful vis-à-vis the truth, I discreetly  
<br />
informed one of my classmates but one of them (the traitor) pushed me  
<br />
up against the speaker’s platform saying “Sir! Marchal wants to  
<br />
tell you something.” I was thoroughly annoyed by this and with  
<br />
infinite politesse let the teacher know about the error in his  
<br />
summary. He remained silent for a while, deciding ultimately to put  
<br />
all the students straight on his mistake. He was never the type to  
<br />
hold out on me and we developed a relationship based on mutual  
<br />
respect. In fact I have an enormous respect for those who can  
<br />
recognise and correct their errors. Recall how much I admired my own  
<br />
father for changing his opinion. With Camus, I opine that perhaps the  
<br />
only eternally persisting thing is stubbornness.
<br />
<br />I fretted also over the choice of university studies even though this  
<br />
still seemed a long way off. I was nevertheless extremely impatient to  
<br />
get to uni if only to be in a position to pose all those questions  
<br />
that both excited and oppressed me. Would I do biology or chemistry? I  
<br />
asked myself this question practically every day.
<br />
<br />By then, I would have the luck to be able to frequent the Molecular  
<br />
Biology Laboratory of ULB at Rhodes-St-Gènese, thanks to the kindness  
<br />
of Jean Rommelaere, whose mother was a friend of my own mother. There,  
<br />
I would meet Jean Brachet who was director of radiobiological services  
<br />
and I especially got the opportunity to meet and chat with René Thomas  
<br />
who directed the bacterial and viral genetics service – Escherichia  
<br />
Coli and the lambda phagias. What an opportune encounter! René Thomas  
<br />
was the biologist who discovered the formal logic in Lewis Carroll’s  
<br />
book The Game of Logic. This was a wonderful book the French edition  
<br />
of which contained magnificent illustrations by Max Ernst, including a  
<br />
drawing of a marvellous planarian worm. Most interesting in René  
<br />
Thomas’ work was his showing how logic circuits could be simulated in  
<br />
bacteria by means of genetic monitoring of the genome of the bacteria;  
<br />
thereby corroborating my intuitive reading of Jacob and Monod’s  
<br />
article to whit life was a matter of encoded dialogues. We promised  
<br />
each other to meet up again; I still had 2 or 3 years of high school  
<br />
to go. This encounter unleashed my impatience to get to university.
<br />
<br />I continued however, to pursue my interest in chemistry and in the  
<br />
question of the amoeba’s constitution. From Linus Pauling I would  
<br />
move on to my next Watson. A real tiny masterpiece came my way: none  
<br />
other than Michel-Yves Bernard’s book Introduction to Quantum  
<br />
Mechanics and Statistical Physics. It was a rare introduction to  
<br />
quantum mechanics written for secondary school students.
<br />
<br />Finally, I fell back on the question “what is matter?” Organisms  
<br />
are societies of cells, cells are societies of molecules, molecules  
<br />
appear to be societies of elementary particles, but the relation  
<br />
between the particles seems to necessitate a science of the  
<br />
continuous. But – what IS the continuous? What, in addition, would  
<br />
the relevant advanced mathematics bring to the issue?
<br />
<br />To summarise, biology and molecular genetics presented strong clues  
<br />
that we are machines. Our biological identity seemed to me to be  
<br />
defined by the encoded information and essentially independent of the  
<br />
material involved, this being continually replaced. In this case, the  
<br />
amoeba faithfully reproduces itself and must be immortal since its  
<br />
identity resides in its form and activity and not in its substance.  
<br />
Hidden behind this, chemistry and mathematics throw a shadow of doubt  
<br />
on this mechanist conception. Even in Newton’s “mechanics”,  
<br />
objects - often identified as “material points” - seem to act at a  
<br />
distance by means of scalar fields in space and described by a  
<br />
mathematics causing the intervention of the mysterious continuum. With  
<br />
quantum mechanics, this aspect of things seems pushed to extremes:  
<br />
even an isolated particle or an atom are described by functions that  
<br />
only cancel out at infinity. It wasn’t at all evident to me how,  
<br />
under such conditions, the amoeba could make identical self- 
<br />
reproductions, or even how it might otherwise self-replicate. With  
<br />
quantum mechanics and the continuous, it seemed that a filament might  
<br />
always subsist between the two apparent amoebas and that in reality,  
<br />
there existed but one amoeba making a good impression of seeming self- 
<br />
division.
<br />
<br />In 1971, on the eve of a scholastic voyage to London, the spiritual  
<br />
conflict between biology and chemistry hit its apogee.
<br />
<br />Above and beyond the immortality of the amoeba on one hand, it seemed  
<br />
that the explanatory power of molecular genetics resided entirely in  
<br />
digitalism. This permits the use of encodings and an explanation in  
<br />
quasi-psychological terms: of memory and its transformation and  
<br />
interpretation. With hindsight, the article of Jacob and Monod on the  
<br />
Lactose operon - rehashed by Taylor7 – represents my first discovery  
<br />
of the formal explanation of “IF...THEN...ELSE” of logicians and  
<br />
computer scientists.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, this quasi-psychological explanation of the  
<br />
functioning of the cell seemed vastly incomplete without a  
<br />
clarification of the nature of matter.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 7: Taylor J.H., Selected Papers on Molecular Genetics,  
<br />

<br />
<br /><br /><br />It sufficed not simply to say that there are things obeying laws; one  
<br />
must also explain what these things are, where they come from, why  
<br />
they obey laws and where the laws themselves come from.
<br />
<br />“Cells obey the laws of chemistry,” said Watson. We shall see.   
<br />
Might it even be that chemistry obeys the laws of cells, as though  
<br />
chemistry were the product of an amoeba’s dreaming...

<br /><br /><br />If DA gives AA; and DB, BB; and DC, CC; what gives DD?
<br />
<br /><br /><br />In 1970 I enrolled in “Poetry”. This is the penultimate year of  
<br />
secondary school. The final year is called “Rhetoric”. My  
<br />
impatience to get to uni was such that I put myself down for the  
<br />
central jury examinations with the idea of leaping over my last two  
<br />
years of high school. Ultimately I did not pursue this enterprise, a  
<br />
largely paradoxical affair. In effect, not only was I in a constant  
<br />
state of hesitation between biology and chemistry, but my doubts had  
<br />
also enlarged to the point where I could now see myself opting for  
<br />
philosophical studies.
<br />
<br />As an independent student, I would attend different classes at  
<br />
university by cutting a few hours of classes at school. In particular  
<br />
I attended the exciting chemistry classes of Lucia de Brouckère from  
<br />
whom I gained the opportunity to briefly go over my hesitancy, but  
<br />
also to chat with in a spirit of free enquiry. Lucia de Brouckère was  
<br />
a towering figure of secularity and freedom of thought in Brussels. I  
<br />
continued to go to the Molecular Biology Laboratory at Rhodes-St- 
<br />
Gènese, although now I only bothered with its library.
<br />
<br />Irritated by my hesitancy as I said earlier, I ended up reading all  
<br />
sorts of books, most found at random during a walk through a bookshop.  
<br />
It was through a reading of Gilles Deleuze’s book Logic of Sense that  
<br />
my mind was finally opened to Lewis Carroll and especially his book  
<br />
Sylvie and Bruno that I read several times in quick succession. I  
<br />
again took up Alice in Wonderland and also The Game of Logic. I still  
<br />
- even today - manage to maintain the claim that English humour is  
<br />
built on the taking seriously of classical logic; this never works –  
<br />
which explains the inherent laughter-value. As a result, I started to  
<br />
take an active interest in logic and in paradoxes of ensemble theory.  
<br />
Besides, I knew that chemistry brought advanced mathematics into the  
<br />
picture, and I had to admit that I took great pleasure in maths  
<br />
classes at school.
<br />
<br />During my scholar’s voyage to London the year before, and in  
<br />
Amsterdam, I recall buying only (Anglo Saxon) books on genetics and  
<br />
chemistry including William Hayes’ fine book on bacterial genetics  
<br />
and their viruses1, as well as the Taylor2 that contained the article  
<br />
by Jacob and Monod. I penned an enthusiastic letter to Bill Hayes who  
<br />
responded with fervent sympathy. That year, now in “Poetry”, I was  
<br />
going to London3. The conflict between chemistry and biology was at  
<br />
its maximum and in Foyles’ Bookshop, I fled this internal quarrel by  
<br />
giving myself over almost entirely to the range of Lewis Carrolls as  
<br />
much as to the mathematics and logic sections of the store.

<br />

<br />
<br />[Footnote 3: I so appreciated London and Oxford for their scientific  
<br />
booksellers - and Lewis Carroll - that from that date on, I would go  
<br />
to England every year, notably to Oxford for what I called my  
<br />
“Carolien Pilgrimage”.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />It was there that I came across the little red book Gödel’s Proof by  
<br />
Nagel and Newman. I had no idea who Gödel was and with what his proof  
<br />
was concerned, but in browsing this book I took it that the work  
<br />
presented a proof on the subject of the existence or the inexistence  
<br />
of a proof. I was intrigued. I next understood that this state of  
<br />
affairs had been achieved by means of an encoding. The resemblance to  
<br />
biological encodings literally leapt off the page to my eyes.
<br />
<br />Without necessarily believing in it too much, I progressively realised  
<br />
that this piece of work proposed a general means with which to  
<br />
construct formal expressions4 capable of referring to themselves. I  
<br />
was surprised to discover that these expressions were perfectly well  
<br />
defined by the signs and symbols that represented them, in much the  
<br />
same way as the amoeba seemed to be by the molecules and atoms of  
<br />
which it was constituted.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 4: collection of signs lending themselves to interpretation  
<br />
at the core of a formal theory, like logical statements, or capable of  
<br />
interpretation by a machine, like a software program. At this time,  
<br />
none of this was anything like a clear notion for me.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />I had a good idea of how the amoeba or Escherichia Coli self-divided,  
<br />
which is to say, I had a quasi-visual model of reproduction at the  
<br />
molecular scale. I thus had to hand a sort of proof that the amoeba  
<br />
could clone itself; but as it turned out, this model (as I have  
<br />
already mentioned) rested on the manner by which the molecules  
<br />
interacted. Because of this, I could not be sure that the amoeba had  
<br />
even replicated – either by itself or with an exact clone resulting.  
<br />
The amoeba’s genome or its genetic encoding had been seemingly  
<br />
replicated identically, but this capacity for identical replication  
<br />
rested to all extents and appearances on the laws of chemistry, which  
<br />
in turn seemed founded on the continuous.
<br />
<br />I wondered whether it truly was the amoeba – this tiny and discrete  
<br />
unit with which I identified since my earliest childhood – that  
<br />
divided itself, or indeed whether it was the very universe – which I  
<br />
conceived of as a gigantic and unknowable continuum – that divided  
<br />
the amoeba.
<br />
<br />With Nagel &amp; Newman in hand, I started to understand that it was  
<br />
possible to envisage self-reproducing entities having a priori no  
<br />
links with chemistry or with the continuous, or even apparently with  
<br />
the universe of physicists or chemists. I discovered a new sort of  
<br />
abstract amoeba that may well be infinitely easier to interrogate than  
<br />
the tiny, concrete beastie inhabiting the waters of the neighbourhood.
<br />
<br />Practically speaking, “Gödel’s Proof” seemed to turn the key in  
<br />
the hesitancy-lockup between chemistry and biology. This was a  
<br />
veritable triumph for biology, all the more so in that its  
<br />
transformation into an abstract biology of formal beings - concerning  
<br />
whose nature I yet lacked complete clarity - might be in order.
<br />
<br />(The dilemma of knowing whether or not, in this case, I could still  
<br />
identify with the amoeba had yet to fully surface. At this stage  
<br />
however, I was so happy to have discovered a totally new kind of  
<br />
amoeba that I relegated this question to the future.)
<br />
<br />There were other things about Nagel &amp; Newman! Not so much in Gödel’s  
<br />
proof – where apparently self- reproductive or self-referential  
<br />
entities appeared – but in the result, in theorem, specifically, in  
<br />
his second incompleteness theorem, published in 1931. In effect, and  
<br />
in rather crude terms, it seemed that there actually existed, say,  
<br />
“whatsit-names” (Fr: machins) with the capacity to communicate true  
<br />
propositions (me – in love with the true! 5), capable in addition of  
<br />
communicating apparently true propositions concerning themselves, but  
<br />
(it would seem) directly because of this, incapable of communicating  
<br />
or of demonstrating6 certain truths about themselves.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />[Footnote 5: Or the idea of the true. Rest assured that I make no  
<br />
claim to having a privileged relationship with the truth. I very much  
<br />
like to propose poetic definitions of the “truth”. For example: the  
<br />
truth is a queen who wins every war minus an army. Or even: the truth  
<br />
is a goddess that no god could ever completely undress. Truth is  
<br />
something you will never read in any newspaper, not even something you  
<br />
might divine for yourself by comparing two independent newspaper  
<br />
articles, or that you might divine even better by comparing three etc.  
<br />
Truth is the source of doubt: the more you know, the more you don’t  
<br />
know; so said Socrates and Jean Gabin.
<br />
<br />Truth is nothing more than the hope of our conscience.]
<br />
<br />[Footnote 6: I will always use the term “communicate” in the sense  
<br />
of honest or scientific affirmation. I identify or model, here and  
<br />
further on, this type of communication with a formal (or the formalism  
<br />
of a) proof.]
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Just like the amoeba, these whatsit names seemed to be intrinsically  
<br />
incapable of affirming certain propositions, certain truths concerning  
<br />
themselves.
<br />
<br />What truths? The consistent quality of the self. The fact that one  
<br />
will not communicate the false.
<br />
<br />Here is an honest entity that, due to its honesty, is completely  
<br />
unable to assert that it is honest. Thus, among honest thingamajigs,  
<br />
those who assert that they are honest are by definition dishonest.  
<br />
Following this realisation, I developed an irresistible attraction for  
<br />
these whatever-they-are. I found them amusing and pertinent. This  
<br />
time, it was no longer a question of abstract biology, but frankly of  
<br />
abstract psychology, and this psychology concerned incommunicable  
<br />
truths, similar to the amoeba’s secret. The most wonderful of all, if  
<br />
I may dare to anticipate Nagel &amp; Newman, is that these entities seem  
<br />
able to prove that if they are honest, then they are incapable of  
<br />
communicating the fact; just as my amoeba seen under the microscope in  
<br />
the act of self-division “told” me that it could not possibly make  
<br />
any claim to having survived. Each of its siblings asserted it  
<br />
implicitly by pointing a pseudopodium at the other amoeba! If one of  
<br />
them was another one of them, they could very well be others – both  
<br />
of them.
<br />
<br />Gödel’s theorem and his proof showed me the existence of (self-)  
<br />
reproductive entities; of abstract amoebas as much as the existence of  
<br />
whatever-you-likes incapable of asserting certain self-referential  
<br />
truths such as the consistent nature of self. This was exactly what I  
<br />
had been looking for. The whatever-you-likes in question were formal  
<br />
theories like Peano arithmetic or the principia mathematica of Russell  
<br />
and Whitehead. No longer in any doubt, I resolved to become a  
<br />
mathematician and to specialise in mathematical logic.
<br />
<br />Note that at this time, I was suffering from an immense handicap: I  
<br />
had not yet heard any talk of Church’s thesis or of the computer. The  
<br />
term “computer” (Fr: ordinateur or “calculating device”) evoked  
<br />
in me visions of the immense and rigid refrigerator lookalikes used by  
<br />
bankers. I had no idea that a century earlier, Babbage had dreamed of  
<br />
a device calculating the positions of heavenly bodies. I had no  
<br />
inkling of a “Turing machine”. I did not yet truly know what I was  
<br />
up to or what I was conjuring with in terms of informatics, much like  
<br />
Jourdain with prose. Grossly speaking, Church’s thesis says that:
<br />
<br />All thing(amajig)s are machines
<br />
<br />(Tous les machins sont des machines)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Or, better: anything formally calculable (and relatively communicable)  
<br />
can be calculated (and relatively asserted) by computers (relative to  
<br />
a formalised theory).
<br />
<br />I still had no idea that machines were actually thingamibobs (the  
<br />
reverse of Church’s thesis) or that universal machines – computers  
<br />
– were at one and the same time close matches to formal theories and  
<br />
very likely candidates for self-reproducing entities. I only realised  
<br />
this much, much later. (In any case, information technology was not  
<br />
yet an entirely new branch of study at university, merely an option  
<br />
for mathematicians or engineers.)
<br />
<br /><br /><br />(to be cont.)
