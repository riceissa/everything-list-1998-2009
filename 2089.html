<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     It is clear that we don't think the same way.  M(x) is simply

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the total measure of observations with the characteristic x.  M(x|y), on

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the other hand, is undefined since &quot;observer&quot; is undefined.  I don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand what you mean by M(x|z).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     For the sake of others who may have forgotten, I'll describe 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;again what is involved.  The problem is to compare the measaure of 1) x = 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;you are the product of Darwinian evolution&quot; and 2) x' = &quot;you are the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;direct result of (quantum or thermal) 'random fluctuations'&quot;.  Presumably, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;x and x' would be seen by different 'observers' if that was defined.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Not at all. The question is: &quot;Given you are a conscious observer, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;compare the measures of x and x'&quot;. The observer is the same in both cases 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and all we know about the observer is the property of consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     I don't know what you mean.  First, by &quot;given you are a conscious 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer&quot;, I think you must mean that you are comparing the measures 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;M(x|you) and M(x'|you).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Part of the problem is you still haven't defined &quot;observer&quot;.  I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't see how the observer could be the same in both cases, but then I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't know what the term &quot;observer&quot; is supposed to mean.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You keep going on about requiring a definition of observer. This is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;red herring. Whilst a full blown theory of concsiouness would be nice,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it is not necessary to make progress in understanding. Recognising
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;certain properties of consciousness such as &quot;Projection&quot; or &quot;Time&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;already has some quite potent consequences.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't ask for a full theory.  I require a definition of observer 
<br />
because 1) it seems obvious that, in principle, there is no such definition 
<br />
that would have all the properties you want.  The only way to dissuade me of 
<br />
that would be to provide said definition, and 2) without the definition, I 
<br />
don't know what you are trying to say.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;The way the statements M(x) and M(x') that you gave are phrased, they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;refer to the same &quot;generic&quot; observer, wondering why it sees an ordered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;world.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is such a &quot;generic&quot; observer, then is he the only observer ever 
<br />
to be in existance?  If so, then maybe I could understand what you mean.  
<br />
Otherwise, surely the Bayesian probabilities that he is the various 
<br />
observers come into play, which you refuse to consider.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Suppose I see a guy named Harry, who verifiably came into being due 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to 'random fluctuations'.  Surely, whatever is meant by 'Harry', that is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one of his characteristics and it's what makes him so popular at parties.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This would be a truly remarkable observation, and would probably put
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into grave doubt the whole idea of the SSA and the Anthropic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Principle. Instead, it would make the idea of an intelligent designer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;much more appealing.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that's a real red herring.  Forget that and answer the question: is 
<br />
it one of Harry's characteristics?  And if so, shouldn't Harry still be 
<br />
surprised to have such an origin?  And if that too, then he is clearly 
<br />
considering the measure of other observers, which he knows is larger than 
<br />
the measure of freaks like him.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;     As you know, I'd sum over all implementations in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;multi-multiverse to find a measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;The problem is that this sum does not converge, because the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;information content of the summed quantity must be zero.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     We've been over this.  The sum is infinite, but that doesn't mean 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ratios are ambiguous if you do it right.  As far as the info content being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;zero, that has zero relevance.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The infiniteness of the sum has nothing to do with it. As you are well
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;aware, infinite series may converge or diverge.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The reason why information content _is_ important, is that if your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;putative absolute measure distribution did in fact exist, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;total ensemble of possibilities has structure, it has some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information, which contradicts the &quot;zero-information&quot; principle.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are smarter than that, Russell.  You must be to have obtained your 
<br />
present position.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the AUH, all possibilities exist.  So no information is needed to 
<br />
specify which ones exist.  But of course there is stucture.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the UTM analogy of the universal distribution.  The universal 
<br />
distribution is the distribution of output strings produced by a UTM, given 
<br />
a uniform distribution of input strings.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is my point - all measure distributions must be relative to some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information processing entity (be they observer or UTM or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever). These &quot;observers&quot; needn't be concrete, but they must have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some properties to enable information in the form of measure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distributions to be extracted.
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, as I have said many times on this list, for the UTM analogy to 
<br />
work there must exist some special UTM or distribution of UTMs which is to 
<br />
be used.  This does *not* mean information is required, because it should be 
<br />
possible to know this distribution based only on special properties that it 
<br />
ought to have.  (Just as it does not take information to know that pi &gt; 3.)  
<br />
If on the other hand that is not sufficient, then nature would need to 
<br />
'arbritrarily' make a choice, in which case the zero information hypothesis 
<br />
should be considered FALSIFIED.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if we consider a measure distibution of conscious computations, 
<br />
then obviously the definition of 'conscious' acts as a filter.  To go back 
<br />
to a bitstring analogy, suppose there is a uniform distribution 'D' of 
<br />
strings, and we want the measure distribution of such strings given an 
<br />
additional property, c.  Obviously M(c) will not (in general) be uniform.  
<br />
Again - no information is required to specify 'D' because it is uniform, yet 
<br />
it leads to a nontrivial M(c).
<br />
M(c) is quite objective; anyone who calculates it would get the same result. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In our case, we are interested in consciousness, so we choose that as a 
<br />
filter.  Me being conscious has nothing to do with the result, just as an 
<br />
unconscious computer could calculate M(c).
<br />
