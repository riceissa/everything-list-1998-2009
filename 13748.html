</em><br />
<br />Sorry, I'd hoped this might emerge more clearly from my dialogue with
<br />
Bruno, but I'm happy to clarify further.  The notion arises from the
<br />
semantics of a particular 'theology', e.g. that of Plotinus' One.  The
<br />
One represents uniqueness and independency: broadly, that which is not
<br />
subject to prior causation.  This is 'existence' conceived as primary
<br />
presence-to-itself; it is consequently 'reflexive' in the sense of
<br />
turning in on itself.  Here we are speaking of 'self' not of course in
<br />
the sense of a 'person', but in terms of primary 'self-relation'.  The
<br />
'many' are conceived as emerging from the One by a process of what
<br />
might then be termed involution (borrowing from evolution).  The One
<br />
stands here as the sole fundamentally ontic category; all subsequent
<br />
involution is epistemic.  More poetically, but rather accurately, this
<br />
is how the One 'gets to know itself'.
<br />
<br />In terms of these 'theological' premises, your questions might be
<br />
answered as follows:
<br />
<br />1) How to distinguish reflexive from non-reflexive existence?
<br />
<br />Anything whatsoever, if it is to exist in any sense other than the
<br />
abstract, must emerge as a category by a process of reflexive
<br />
involution from the One.  Consequently all 'existents' could be said
<br />
to 'exist reflexively'.  Non-reflexive existence then equates to
<br />
non-existence.  One might then wonder: what is the point of the
<br />
qualification 'reflexively'?  The point is that it is an implicit
<br />
qualification, and consequently we may inadvertently delete it - by
<br />
abstraction - when we postulate what may 'exist', especially in the
<br />
'all possible worlds' context of this list.
<br />
<br />For example, ISTM that as soon as one explicitly conceives a
<br />
'B-Universe'  - in contrast to Torgny's implicit assumption - as
<br />
having emerged by reflexive involution of the One, it becomes very
<br />
much harder to see how it could do so without 'getting to know itself'
<br />
in the process.  IOW, the 'stuff' that seemed merely a peculiar
<br />
'optional extra' in its implicitly non-reflexive (i.e. in a rather
<br />
literal sense, abstracted) conceptual form, can be seen to integrate
<br />
organically with the 'physical specification' through the epistemic
<br />
self-relation of the One.
<br />
<br />2) Do numbers exist reflexively?
<br />
<br />An interesting question.  Bruno, I think, might say that they do, or
<br />
at least that numbers and their relations can be used to mathematise
<br />
Plotinus' reflexive schema.  I would say that to accept any such
<br />
mathematisation as a basis for our own existence, in some ineliminable
<br />
sense they must be held to exist reflexively.  An intuitionist answer,
<br />
I guess, would be that they are abstractions of pre-mathematical
<br />
emergent categories of the One.
<br />
<br />3) Do somethings exist non-reflexively?
<br />
<br />No, a something gets to be a something solely in virtue of being a
<br />
product of a process of reflexive involution of the One.
<br />
<br />4) What is &quot;self-reflexion&quot;?
<br />
<br />Emphasis, I suppose.  If reflexion is already self-relation, then
<br />
self-reflexion is merely an emphatic form of the same notion.
<br />
Redundant, perhaps.
<br />
<br />5) What's the operational definition of reflexive?
<br />
<br />IOW what would one do to discover if something exists reflexively?  I
<br />
suppose in the end this is empiricism.  If it kicks back, it's
<br />
participating in the web of reflexive involution.  If it never kicks
<br />
back, it may be just because it isn't.  So I would say that the
<br />
B-Universe as conceived by Torgny isn't specified reflexively: i.e.
<br />
its putative properties are characteristic of situations imagined in a
<br />
form abstracted from reflexivity.  For this reason I would claim that
<br />
it could never kick back: i.e. have any consequences, make its
<br />
presence felt, survive the cut of Occam's razor, etc.  I could of
<br />
course be wrong.
<br />
<br />Does this help at all?
