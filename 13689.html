<br />
After very kindly concurring with bits of my recent posts, Bruno
<br />
nonetheless quite reasonably questioned whether I followed his way of
<br />
proceeding.  Having read the UDA carefully, I would say that in a
<br />
'grandmotherly' way I do, although not remotely at his technical
<br />
level.  But I had been doing thought experiments of a somewhat similar
<br />
nature literally for decades, based on questions like &quot;why am I me and
<br />
not you?&quot; or &quot;how do I know that me now is the same as me 5 minutes
<br />
ago?&quot; or &quot;is the person who gets out of the transporter the same
<br />
person as the one who began the journey?&quot;  For some time, faced
<br />
largely with incomprehension or disinterest, and seeing hardly
<br />
anything remotely like this referred to in print, I despaired of
<br />
finding others who believed these questions were anything but
<br />
irrelevant or crazy.  But gradually these topics seemed to emerge into
<br />
discussion from a variety of directions, and now I've found a
<br />
community of similarly crazy people on the Internet.
<br />
<br />The conclusion I had come to is broadly summarised in my recent
<br />
posts.  It seemed to me that the 'transporter' questions could only be
<br />
resolved if I thought in terms of my being incorporated in some unique
<br />
or 'global' pre-differentiated manner, which nonetheless
<br />
multifariously self-localised by differentiation of structures that
<br />
embodied distinct 'histories'.  This seemed somehow to entail the
<br />
emergence of finitude from the not-finite, which seemed weirdly
<br />
right.  Anyway, it would be the histories that differed, not the
<br />
'self'.  The histories would break the symmetry of the self into
<br />
differentiated sub-selves that would be 'I' with respect to their own
<br />
private environments.  These environments, being participatory, could
<br />
only be shared with other such sub-selves by signalling', and the sum
<br />
total of shareable signals, re-embodied, would be the 'objective' or
<br />
'outside' physical description of the situation.  But since these
<br />
'entities' could only be self-defined emergents of the original self-
<br />
relativisation, everything was in fact 'outside-less' and continued to
<br />
exist uniquely or monistically as a network of self-relation.
<br />
Depending on whether the participatory or 'objective' perspective was
<br />
adopted, self-relation could apparently decompose into 'sense' or
<br />
'action' narratives, but such decomposition was in fact illusory, or
<br />
perspective-dependent.  Self-relation in fact remained singular or
<br />
decomposable in nature
<br />
<br />Having said this, I can now perhaps contextualise more clearly my
<br />
concern about functionalism.  Functionalism is the doctrine that
<br />
consciousness is a function of the relationship between parts.  This
<br />
entails that, discounting eliminativism, consciousness must be
<br />
actualised by such relations, and that if such parts were to be
<br />
considered 'ultimately' to be physical, then the relevant relations
<br />
could only be physical relations.  If this were so, the actual or
<br />
realised relationships existent in a physical structure would be
<br />
exhausted by its physical description, and the ascription of a super-
<br />
added set of 'computational' relationships would merely be
<br />
metaphorical and hence not real enough to be &quot;I&quot;.  Consequently, if
<br />
physics is held to be fundamental to consciousness, and consciousness
<br />
is an observer effect, then such observers must be fully describable
<br />
by physical relationships, not functional ones, and the appropriate
<br />
substitution level is physical duplication, to some level of
<br />
tolerance.
<br />
<br />By contrast, if the reality of parts and relationships is to be
<br />
considered fundamentally numerical, then consciousness and physics
<br />
could indeed be derived functionally or computationally from this kit
<br />
of parts and their relations.  From this perspective, the physical
<br />
structure of the body and the observational structure of the mind
<br />
could be held to emerge respectively from 'action' and 'sense'
<br />
decompositions of the fundamental self-relative nature of number-
<br />
relations.  Nonetheless, if the observer decomposition continues to be
<br />
regarded as 'functional' with respect to the physical one, they remain
<br />
in some deep sense orthogonal - i.e. the 'functionalism' is that of
<br />
'imaginary parts' and 'imaginary relations' with respect to the
<br />
physical description.  It follows that there may be no final way of
<br />
'de-crypting' any unambiguous observer structure from the physical
<br />
description alone.  We would then be left unavoidably with an
<br />
'objectively' unknowable and unprovable imputation of consciousness to
<br />
any physically-defined structure.  So be it.  But it might then be
<br />
questioned how observer and physical narratives could somehow
<br />
'converge' on a common or consistent environmental interface as a
<br />
result of any form of co-evolution. Such a notion would seem to imply
<br />
that equivalent selection effects could be operating on both
<br />
environments despite their orthogonal orientation. It is not
<br />
immediately apparent why this should be so.
<br />
<br />It may consequently offer some theoretical advantages to suppose that
<br />
a single evolutionary path is followed as a consequence of one-to-one
<br />
reciprocity at some level between sense and action components of a
<br />
primitively self-relative narrative, and that consciousness is
<br />
consequently not 'functional' with respect to the physical
<br />
description, but in some real sense isomorphic or analogic.  This
<br />
would not, ISTM, be to postulate any fundamental 'material' substrate,
<br />
but rather to be saying something about the way a 'neutral'
<br />
fundamentally self-relative process could 'decompose' into apparently
<br />
reciprocal components as a consequence of the embodiment of
<br />
observation.  However, I can't at this point see whether such
<br />
alternatives can be resolved purely theoretically, or whether they are
<br />
fundamentally empirical issues.
