<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Bruno,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I started to read [the English version of] your discourse on Origin of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Physical Laws and Sensations. I will read more later. It is certainly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; very interesting and thought provoking. It makes me think of 'Reasons
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and Persons' by Derek Parfitt. His book is very dry in places but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mostly very well worth the effort of ploughing through it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Parfit is good. I stop to follow him when he insists that we are token. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I paraphrase myself sometimes by the slogan MANY TYPES NO TOKEN.
</em><br />
<br />Can you explain the disagreement with Parfit? My reading of chapter 99 of 
<br />
R &amp; P is that a &quot;token&quot; is a particular instantiation of a person while a &quot;type&quot; 
<br />
is the ensemble of related instantiations. &quot;Mary Smith&quot; is a type, &quot;Mary Smith 
<br />
coming out of replicator no. 978 at 11:05 AM&quot; is a token. 
<br />
<br />It appears that in this terminology (actually due to Bernard Williams, not Parfit) 
<br />
once generated a token remains the same token until there is another branching, 
<br />
but my preference is to generalise the term and say that a token has only transient 
<br />
existence, which then makes &quot;token&quot; equivalent to &quot;observer moment&quot;. This is 
<br />
literally true, given that from moment to moment, even in the absence of teleportation 
<br />
etc., the atoms in your body turn over such that after a certain time none of the 
<br />
matter in your body is the &quot;same&quot;, and before this time the fact that some of the 
<br />
matter in your body is the &quot;same&quot; is accidental and makes no difference to your 
<br />
conscious experience.
<br />
<br />As to whether I am token or type: obviously, literally, I-who-write-this-now am a 
<br />
token. My present token is included in the set of related tokens in the past, future, 
<br />
other branches of the multiverse, surreptitious emulations of my mind made by aliens, 
<br />
and so on: the type. Note that the definition of a particular token (especially in my 
<br />
generalised sense, fixed to a specific and unique position in the multiverse) can be 
<br />
made completely unambiguous, while the definition of a type is necessarily vague and 
<br />
fuzzy arround the edges. For example, if a being exists somewhere with 70% of 
<br />
my memories and 30% of your memories, should he be included in my type, your type, 
<br />
a new type, or some combination of these? It is only because we experience a linear 
<br />
existence from birth to death, so that only a single token is extant at a time and there 
<br />
is clear physical continuity from one token to the next, that we can ignore the distinction 
<br />
between token and type and consider the definition of a particular type to be 
<br />
unambiguous.
<br />
<br />As for what matters in survival, that is a contingent fact of the way our brains have 
<br />
evolved. It isn't as simple as saying that survival of type is what matters, except in the 
<br />
abovementioned linear existence with which we are familiar. One concise way to put it 
<br />
is that what matters in survival is that there should exist at least one token (or observer 
<br />
moment, or instantiation) which has my present token's memories in its past. Moreover, 
<br />
it is important that where several such tokens exist, as I may feel myself &quot;becoming&quot; any 
<br />
one of them with equal probability, as many as possible should have good experiences. 
<br />
This works for simple branchings, but it becomes complicated when we consider mergings 
<br />
and partial memory loss. Another problem is tokens in parallel worlds: I could say I don't 
<br />
survive if no future tokens exist who have my present memories, even though other tokens 
<br />
exist in the multiverse who branched off some time ago, but then that would be like saying 
<br />
I don't survive if I experience any memory loss at all, for example due to medications like 
<br />
midazolam. It could be that every second, tokens are finding themselves in hellish multiverse 
<br />
branches where they suffer horribly then die, which is equivalent to suffering horribly then 
<br />
having the memory of the experience erased. We can describe exactly what happens in each 
<br />
of these cases using the token or observer moment terminology, but reconciling this with 
<br />
psychological survival is problematic because our brains did not evolve to cope with these 
<br />
sorts of situations.
