<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I want to make a brief comment about what Gilles Henri
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;said to Hal Finney some days ago:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I think that nobody answered me satisfactorily on the problem of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;&quot;interpreting&quot; or recognizing&quot; a string. I could compare this problem to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;gauge invariance in physics. It's well known that all physical theories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;admit many equivalent representations or gauge transformations. However, to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;represent &quot;physically&quot; something, they must contain quantities invariant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;upon these transformations, that allow to recognize intrinsic features :
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;e.g. proper interval in general relativity, curvature of space-time and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;more generally the action in any known theory.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;You seem to admit as obvious that a computation or a string can represent,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;or better *be* a physical state of the Universe. However when you think  of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;a real way to connect them, it seems obvious that you have to precize a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;of doing that. If you want to describe the positions of all atoms, or the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;values of a field, you have to precise the coding of real numbers and so
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;on. When Bruno says that the UD will solve Wheeler-DeWitt equation, it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;assumes some coding that allows to recognize the solution in a string. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;may be wrong, but I don't see how you can definie intrinsic physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;quantities (like the curvature of the space time for example) independantly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;on these representations (same problem with the &quot;matching pattern&quot; of Hal).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;It means also that the same string can represent (under different coding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;schemes) different, and even quite different Universes. So it cannot posses
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;intrinsically all physical properties, and for example the presence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;living beings. Maybe I am wrong and you know works proving the contrary?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You must take into account the fact that the &quot;interpreter&quot; is itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;encoded in the string.
</em><br />
GH:
<br />
<br />If you mean that a string has a unique &quot;interpreter&quot; encoded in itself, I
<br />
like to know where it is and how to find it!
<br />
<br />The problem I ask is the following: we know that our Universe is such that
<br />
there are apparent external, objectively measurable quantities. If you
<br />
think you have an ontological theory, or maybe a heuristic theory deeper
<br />
than what we use currently to describe it (QM and GR), the least you can
<br />
expect is to be able to give unambiguous, objective rule to reproduce the
<br />
current theory in some limiting cases. For example even if classical
<br />
mechanics is unappropriate at some level, you still have precise
<br />
prescriptions to give sense to the mass of a particle from quantum field
<br />
theories, or to newtonian gravitational forces from general relativity in
<br />
&quot;classical approximations&quot;.
<br />
<br />Examining the idea that a state of the Universe could &quot;be&quot; a string, I just
<br />
ask how to extract &quot;classical&quot; quantities from a string, given the infinite
<br />
number of ways of interpreting it. If you think that there is an
<br />
interpreter, or a set of interpreters in this string, this would actually
<br />
answer this question. The prescription would be: &quot;find the interpreter in
<br />
the string by this way, and interpret the rest of the string with this
<br />
interpreter&quot;. But I have no idea of how finding *intrinsically* an
<br />
interpreter in a string!
<br />
<br />BM:
<br />
If you do that, you will be able to use a lot of existing invariance
<br />
results from theoretical computer science for ascribing RELATIVE
<br />
representational content to computationnal states. These &quot;contents&quot; depend
<br />
on the existence of a representation for the interpreter and the data, but
<br />
are invariant with respect to the choice of a representation.
<br />
<br />GH:
<br />
<br />I suspect all invariance results are relative to the computability or the
<br />
complexity of the string. I don't think it is enough to give numerical or
<br />
structural (e.g. topological) informations.
<br />
You could assume that a string could describe an organized world if there
<br />
exists a representation through which you can calculate from it physical
<br />
quantities actually describing this organized world (am I clear?). The
<br />
problem is taht if you do not restrict the complexity of the
<br />
representation, any (complex enough) string can represent anything. For
<br />
example, given any &quot;regular&quot; string with 10^400 bits, you could pick up the
<br />
bits in some convenient order to reproduce the 3D universe at the time I am
<br />
writing, or at the time you are reading, or at any other time (or any other
<br />
universe with any dimensionality..)
<br />
<br />So I think you have to restrict yourself to &quot;simple enough&quot;
<br />
representations, (that means interpreters much simpler than the string
<br />
itself) for example representations implying the existence of physical
<br />
laws. In this case, lambs will never eat wolves. But then it is not
<br />
different from assuming &quot;ontologically&quot; physical laws and think of their
<br />
numerical implementation.
<br />
<br />To summarize I have the feeling that if you want a string to describe
<br />
something, you have to put restrictions on the way you choose the
<br />
representation ; a string can represent an organized world only if there is
<br />
a &quot;simple&quot; representation through which you can derive a &quot;simple&quot; world
<br />
from it. But this is probably equivalent to say that the world must be
<br />
simple enough (i.e. be described by physical laws), which is a strong
<br />
restriction on the &quot;everything&quot; hypothesis (this is *not* anthropic
<br />
principle!).
<br />
