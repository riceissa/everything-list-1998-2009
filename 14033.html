Here's my comment on David Wallace's 2005 paper, &quot;Quantum Probability from 
<br />
Subjective Likelihood:
<br />
improving on Deutsch's proof of the probability rule&quot; available at 
<br />
<a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002302/">http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00002302/</a>. I think this is probably 
<br />
one of the main works referred to in the New Scientist article.
<br />
<br />The main assumption Wallace uses for his derivation of the Born rule is 
<br />
&quot;equivalence&quot;, which means that any rational agent must regard 
<br />
equally-weighted events to be equally probable. In my view, the biggest 
<br />
problem with this assumption is, what if the two events have equal weights 
<br />
but different phases? Wallace handles the question in a couple of sentences 
<br />
on page 18:
<br />
<br />As for phase, this can be incorporated
<br />
by allowing phase changes in the erasure process: if |'erased(i)', 
<br />
rewardi&gt; is a
<br />
valid erasure state, so is exp(i theta) |'erased(i)', rewardi&gt;. More 
<br />
directly, it can be
<br />
incorporated by observing that a phase transformation of an entire branch is
<br />
completely unobservable, so an agent should be indifferent to it.
<br />
(end quote)
<br />
<br />I'd answer that an event being unobservable is not sufficient reason for an 
<br />
agent to be indifferent to it. If it were, then we would all be indifferent 
<br />
to events that will only occur after our death (such as the disposition of 
<br />
our estates) but we clearly are not. Another way to see this is that the 
<br />
phrase &quot;phase change&quot; in the above argument can be replaced with &quot;quantum 
<br />
suicide&quot; and the argument goes through with the same force of logic (or lack 
<br />
thereof).
<br />
<br />Instead of saying any rational agent must follow the Born rule, I'd 
<br />
reinterpret Wallace's derivation as saying that for any rational agent, if 
<br />
he doesn't care about phase, then he should follow the Born rule. Similarly, 
<br />
for any rational agent who really cares only about what he will observe, he 
<br />
should be indifferent to virtually everything since he can always make the 
<br />
observations come out the way he wants by using quantum suicide.

Subject: New Scientist: Parallel universes make quantum sense
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; New Scientist has an article on parallel universes:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; David Deutsch at the University of Oxford and colleagues have shown
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that key equations of quantum mechanics arise from the mathematics of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; parallel universes. &quot;This work will go down as one of the most important
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; developments in the history of science,&quot; says Andy Albrecht, a physicist
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at the University of California at Davis. In one parallel universe,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at least, it will - whether it does in our one remains to be seen.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is behind a paywall at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg19526223.700-parallel-universes-make-quantum-sense.html">http://space.newscientist.com/article/mg19526223.700-parallel-universes-make-quantum-sense.html</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I found a copy on Google Groups:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.kq.p/browse_thread/thread/9631b2e37ba5e7a2/fb3202c9c5b71228?lnk=st&amp;q=%22new+scientist%22+deutsch+albrecht&amp;rnum=1#fb3202c9c5b71228">http://groups.google.com/group/alt.kq.p/browse_thread/thread/9631b2e37ba5e7a2/fb3202c9c5b71228?lnk=st&amp;q=%22new+scientist%22+deutsch+albrecht&amp;rnum=1#fb3202c9c5b71228</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It has a great quote from Tegmark: &quot;The critique of many worlds is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shifting from 'it makes no sense and I hate it' to simply 'I hate it'.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The thrust of the article is about recent work to fix the two perceived
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems in the MWI: non-uniqueness of basis (the universe splits in all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different ways) and recovering the Born rule. The basis problem is now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; considered (by supporters) to be resolved via improved understanding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of decoherence. This work (which was not particularly focused on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; MWI) generally seems to lead to a unique basis for measurement-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interactions, hence there is no ambiguity in terms of which way the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; universe splits.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for the Born rule, the article points to the effort begun by Deutsch in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1999 to base things on decision theory. The idea is that we fundamentally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; care about probability insofar as it influences the decisions and choices
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we make, so if we can recover a sensible decision theory in the MWI, we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have basically explained probability. I've seen a number of critiques of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Deutsch's paper but according to this article, subsequent work by David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wallace and Simon Saunders has extended it to the point where things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are pretty solid.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hence the two traditional objections to the MWI are now at least arguably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dealt with, and given its advantage in terms of formal simplicity (fewer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; axioms), supporters argue that it should be considered the leading
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; model for QM. This is where we get claims about it being among the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important discoveries in the history of mankind, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's interesting to see the resistance of the physics community to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; multiverse concepts. It all comes back to the tradition of experimental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; verification I suppose, which is still pretty much impossible. Really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it is more a question of philosophy than of physics as we currently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand these disciplines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We see the same thing happening all over again in string theory. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; don't know if you guys are following this at all. String theory is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going through a crisis as it has turned out in the past few years that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it does not predict a single universe, rather a multiverse where there
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a &quot;landscape&quot; of possible sets of parameters, each of which would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; correspond to a universe. The big problem is that there is no natural
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or accepted measure (unlike with QM where everyone knew all along that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the measure had to be the Born rule and it was just a matter of how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; many hoops you had to jump through to pull it out of your model).  As a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; result it looks like it might be impossible to get even probabilistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; predictions out of the string theory landscape.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AFAIK no one within the community has followed our path and looked
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at algorithmic complexity as a source of measure (i.e. the Universal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Distribution, which says that the simplest theories have higher measure).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Granted, even if that direction were pursued it would probably be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computationally intractable so they still would not be able to pull much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out in the way of predictions. Neverthless physicists are skilled at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; use of approximation and assumptions to get plausible predictions out of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even rather opaque mathematics so it's possible they might get somewhere.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But at this point it looks like the resistance is too strong. Rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than string theory making the multiverse respectable as we might hope,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it seems likely that the multiverse will kill string theory.
