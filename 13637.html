<br />I hope so!  Let's see...
<br />
<br />RS:  This last post is perfectly lucid to me.
<br />
<br />Phew!!  Well, that's a good start.
<br />
<br />RS:  I hope I've answered it
<br />
adequately.
<br />
<br />Your answer is very interesting - not quite what I expected:
<br />
<br />RS:  In some Platonic sense, all possible observers are already
<br />
out there, but by physically instantiating it in our world, we are in
<br />
effect opening up a communication channel between ourselves and the
<br />
new consciousness.
<br />
<br />I think I must be missing something profound in your intended meanings of:
<br />
<br />1) 'out there'
<br />
2) 'physically instantiating'
<br />
3) 'our world'
<br />
<br />My current 'picture' of it is as follows.  The 'Platonic sense' I assume
<br />
equates to the 'bit-string plenitude' (which is differentiable from 'no
<br />
information' only by internal observers, like the Library of Babel - a
<br />
beautiful idea BTW).  But I'm assuming a 'hierarchy' of recursive
<br />
computational emergence through bits up through, say, strings, quarks,
<br />
atoms, molecules, etc - in other words what is perceived as matter-energy by
<br />
observers.  I then assume that both 'physical objects' and any correlated
<br />
observers emerge from this matter-energy level, and that this co-emergence
<br />
accomplishes the 'physical instantiation'.  IOW, the observer is the
<br />
1-person view, and the physical behaviour the 3-person view, of the same
<br />
underlying complex emergent - they're different descriptions of the same
<br />
events.
<br />
<br />If this is so, then as you say, the opening of the 'communication channel'
<br />
would be a matter of establishing the means and modes of interaction with
<br />
any new consciousness, because the same seamless underlying causal sequence
<br />
unites observer-world and physical-world: again, different descriptions,
<br />
same events.
<br />
<br />If the above is accepted (but I'm beginning to suspect there's something
<br />
deeply wrong with it), then the 'stability' of the world of the observer
<br />
should equate to the 'stability' of the physical events to which it is
<br />
linked through *identity*.  Now here's what puzzles me.  ISTM that the
<br />
imputation of 'computation' to the physical computer is only through the
<br />
systematic correspondence of certain stable aspects of its (principally)
<br />
electronic behaviour to computational elements: numbers,
<br />
mathematical-logical operators, etc.  The problem is in the terms
<br />
'imputation' and 'correspondence': this is surely merely a *way of speaking*
<br />
about the physical events in the computer, an arbitrary ascription, from an
<br />
infinite possible set, of externally-established semantics to the intrinsic
<br />
physical syntactics.
<br />
<br />Consequently, ISTM that the emergence of observer-worlds has to be
<br />
correlated (somehow) - one-to-one, or isomorphically - with corresponding
<br />
'physical' events: IOW these events, with their 'dual description',
<br />
constitute a single 'distinguished' *causal* sequence.  By contrast, *any*
<br />
of the myriad 'computational worlds' that could be ascribed to the same
<br />
events must remain - to the computer, rather than the programmer - only
<br />
arbitrary or 'imaginary' ones.  This is why I described them as 'nested' -
<br />
perhaps 'orthogonal' or 'imaginary' are better: they may - 'platonically' -
<br />
exist somewhere in the plenitude, but causally disconnected from the
<br />
physical world in which the computer participates. The computer doesn't
<br />
'know' anything about them.  Consequently, how could they possess any
<br />
'communication channel' to the computer's - and our - world 'out there'?
<br />
<br />Of course I'm not claiming by this that machines couldn't be conscious.  My
<br />
claim is rather that if they are, it couldn't be solely in virtue of any
<br />
'imaginary computational worlds' imputed to them, but rather because they
<br />
support some unique, distinguished process of *physical* emergence that also
<br />
corresponds to a unique observer-world: and of course, mutatis mutandis,
<br />
this must also apply to the 'mind-brain' relationship.
<br />
<br />If I'm wrong (as no doubt I am), ISTM I must have erred in some step or
<br />
other of my logic above.  How do I debug it?

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; DN: It's interesting that you should perceive it in this way: I hadn't

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thought about it like this, but I suspect you're not wrong.  I haven't

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; stuff in the style you refer to, although I often find it rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; indigestible!  But on the other hand, much of my professional experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; been in the world of computer programming, right back to machine code
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; days,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; so I'm very aware of the difference between 'syntax' and 'semantics',
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; know too well how consequences can diverge wildly from a difference of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; single bit.  How often have I heard the beleaguered self-tester wail &quot;I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; didn't *mean* that!&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Interesting indeed. I wouldn't have guessed you to have been a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programmer. Perhaps you are one of those rare souls with a foot in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; each camp. That could be be very productive!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; However, in the spirit of the original topic of the thread, I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prefer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to ask you directly about the plausibility (which, unless I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; misunderstood, you support?) of an AI-program being in principle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'conscious'.  I take this to entail that instantiating such a program
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; thereby implements an 'observer' that can respond to and share a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reality, in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; broadly the same terms, with human 'observers'.  (I apologise in advance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; any paraphrase or short-hand I adopt misrepresents what you say in TON):
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It seems plausible, certainly.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; TON, as you comment in the book, takes the 'idealist' stance that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'concrete'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; notions emerge from observation.  Our own relative status as observers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; participating in 'worlds' is then dependent on computational 'emergence'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; from the plenitude of all possible bit-strings.  Let's say that I'm such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; observer and I observe a 'computer' like the one I'm using now.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'computer' is a 3-person 'concrete emergent' in my 1-person world, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the 'plurality' of observers with whom I'm in relation: we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'interact'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with it. Now, we collectively *impute* that some aspect of its 3-person
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; behaviour (e.g. EM phenomena in its internal circuitry) is to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regarded as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'running an AI program' (i.e. ISTM that this is what happens when we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'compile and run' a program).  In what way does such imputation entail
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; evocation - despite the myriad possible 'concrete' instantiations that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; represent it - of a *stable* observer capable of participating in our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shared
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; '1-person plural' context?  IOW, I'm concerned that two different
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; categories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are being conflated here: the 'world' at the 'observer level' that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; includes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; me and the computer, and the 'world' of the program, which is 'nested'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; inside this.  How can this 'nested' world get any purchase on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'observables'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; that are 'external' to it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is no different to a conscious being instantiated in a new-born
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; baby (or 18 month old, or whenever babies actually become
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conscious). In some Platonic sense, all possible observers are already
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out there, but by physically instantiating it in our world, we are in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; effect opening up a communication channel between ourselves and the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new consciousness.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As I re-read this question, I wonder whether I've already willy-nilly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fallen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; into the '2-cultures' gap again.  But what I've asked seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; related to the issues raised by 'Olympia and Klara', and by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; substitution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; level dilemma posed by 'yes doctor'.  Could you show me where - or if -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I go
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; wrong, or does the 'language game' make our views forever mutually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unintelligible?
