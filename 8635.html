<br />
I think what Saibal was referring to can be illustrated by a device used 
<br />
quite often in science fiction, where a person's mind is &quot;backed up&quot; at time 
<br />
t1, then restored from backup when the person dies at time t2. The effect 
<br />
for the person is exactly the same as if he had not died at t2, but instead 
<br />
lost  all memory of what had happened to him between t1 and t2. The 
<br />
situation in the multiverse differs in that (a) the &quot;backup&quot; is happening 
<br />
continually; (b) the &quot;backup&quot; is run immediately on being made, rather than 
<br />
waiting for a particular event; and (c) the period of effective memory loss 
<br />
involves the entire world rather than the person alone, so that he cannot 
<br />
access any record of his death after being restored from backup. (b) and (c) 
<br />
should not make a substantive difference, and (a) should be an advantage, 
<br />
since it means that in the multiverse, the period of memory loss will never 
<br />
be more than a moment, even if some terminal situation does arise from which 
<br />
there is no escape. Given that in some branch of the multiverse the Governor 
<br />
grants clemency a fraction of a second before the poison enters Tookie's 
<br />
vein, this is equivalent to a fraction of a second of memory loss for the 
<br />
version of Tookie in the branches where the execution goes ahead.
<br />
<br />Having said that, I'm still unclear as to why you think such situations of 
<br />
no escape might actually arise in the multiverse. In order for Tookie to 
<br />
survive the lethal injection, or even a direct nuclear hit for that matter, 
<br />
it isn't even necessary to find some physically possible means of escape. 
<br />
All that is necessary, as you say, is that &quot;observer moments for Tookie 
<br />
exist which include the memories of his having received the lethal 
<br />
injection, but not of dying as a result&quot;. Now, surely you can think of 
<br />
possible, albeit unlikely, ways in which this might happen. For example, 
<br />
benevolent alien scientists opposed to capital punishment probe Tookie with 
<br />
neutrino beams at the moment of death, store the information, then use it 
<br />
later to either physically resurrect him or just run a copy of his mind in 
<br />
virtual reality on a computer network. That would involve a &quot;causal link&quot; 
<br />
between the pre- and post-execution Tookie. But how would Tookie know the 
<br />
difference if he were resurrected non-causally? For example, what if the 
<br />
requisite post-execution observer moments came about in the alien computer 
<br />
network not because the scientists input the specific data, but as the 
<br />
result of an algorithm that explored all possible, or a random subset of, 
<br />
human-type sentient programs? Surely the significant thing is that there be 
<br />
some post-execution Tookie OM, not how that OM comes about. Of course, such 
<br />
OMs are *far* more likely to come about if there is some physical, causal 
<br />
process to bring them about, just as someone who tries to log onto my 
<br />
computer account is far more likely to succeed if he somehow finds out my 
<br />
username and password. But if the state of California manages to destroy all 
<br />
the physical/causal processes allowing Tookie to survive and all that is 
<br />
left is the equivalent of trying usernames and passwords at random, the 
<br />
multiverse will not run out of time or patience before the correct 
<br />
combination comes up. As discussed in my previous post, this is certain 
<br />
because the number of possible brain states (hence mental states) is finite, 
<br />
as long as the size of your brain remains finite.
<br />
<br />In summary: if you are Tookie and the MWI is true, you are unlikely to find 
<br />
yourself living in a branch which leads to your execution in the first 
<br />
place. If you do find yourself living in a seemingly terminal branch, 
<br />
something will happen at the last possible moment to save you. If nothing 
<br />
happens to save you, the multiverse will effectively back up your mind so 
<br />
that your death would only constitute the subjective equivalent of the 
<br />
tiniest amount of memory loss. And if even this amount of memory loss is 
<br />
unacceptable to you, the multiverse has more than enough resources to 
<br />
guarantee that somewhere, sometime a post-execution Tookie with every memory 
<br />
intact will rise again.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; To me it seems that the notion of ''successor'' has to break down at

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cases
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; where the observer can die. The Tookies that are the most similar to the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Tookie who got executed are the ones who got clemency. There is no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;objective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reason why these Tookies should be excluded as ''successors''. They miss 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; part of their memories about things that happened after clemency was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;denied.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Instead of those memories they have other memories. We forget things all 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time. Sometimes we remember things that didn't really happen. So, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;allow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; for information loss anyway. My point is then that we should forget 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; all of the information contained in the OM and just sample from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; set of OMs.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(After being away for a couple weeks, I'd like to follow up with yours
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and others replies.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find this line of argument hard to follow.  I think where we differ is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that I assume there must be some physical causality connecting observer
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moments.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That is, if a person is in physical state A and is experiencing state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;E(A), then their next subjective moment E(B) must have some connected,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;causal path between physical state A and physical state B. This
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reasoning makes the materialist assumption that subjective experience E
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is entirely defined by the physical state of the observer.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;According to MWI, physical state A actually evolves into a superposition
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of discrete physical states B, each with a different &quot;density&quot; or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;measure.&quot;  So, by the logic of the previous paragraph, subjective
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience E(A) must evolve into a superposition of discrete Es, each a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;function of the particular discrete physical state B it arises from, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each with a particular measure.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Some subset of this superposition of physical states B, however, do not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;support the creation of subjective experience (say, where the person has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;died.)  So some proportion of E(B)'s are null.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So my original question about &quot;what is happening to Tookie now&quot; can be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rephrased as the following thought experiment:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Physical state A is Tookie lying on a gurney, experiencing E(A), which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is getting injected with lethal toxin by the State of California.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Clearly, the vast majority of the elements of superposition of states B
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which follow the execution are with him being dead, and do not give rise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to any subjective experience at all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What are the possibilities for causally connected physical states which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't involve his death?  Which B's exist which continue to give rise to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;new E(B)'s?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In other words, which observer moments for Tookie exist which include
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the memories of his having received the lethal injection, but not of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dying as a result?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does there have to be any at all?  QTI says yes, there must be, and no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;matter how unlikely--there is always escape in some form.  What was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tookie's?
