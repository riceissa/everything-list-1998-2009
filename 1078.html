<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I fail to see how the format of the inputs, eg ASCII, has any bearing on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussion. I have an optical system than converts data such as colours into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;electrical signals, like a keyboard converts ascii characters into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;electrical signals and a monitor convert them back.
</em><br />
<br />James, it is just a definition of a HLUT. As defined by Hans, it is ONLY
<br />
programmed to handle language, through exchange of ASCII characters(am I
<br />
wrong, Hans?). It is NOT interfaced with the external world to handle other
<br />
kind of information. Furthermore the HLUT program is EXPLICIT, not
<br />
compressed (or it is no more &quot;humongus&quot;!) So my &quot;experiment&quot; is really
<br />
demonstrating that you must handle other information than ascii characters,
<br />
and that there is no way to programm &quot;only&quot; a correct language capability
<br />
without interfacing the system with its environment (what you are
<br />
apparently). As I said, if you are really able to handle all environmental
<br />
information and to link them correctly to a language, you ARE a thinking
<br />
machine that I can not distinguish from a human being by this way. There
<br />
are other ways by which I can know if you are a human, for example by
<br />
asking you to send me a scanned picture of your mother, or to send you a
<br />
DNA probe and ask you to analyze your DNA and send me the results,
<br />
etc...(my machine is coded in such a manner that you will have to send me
<br />
the encrypted result without possibility of cheating), or send you some
<br />
drug which has a curious effect on the mind, that I know but that I let you
<br />
discover, etc.... But of course it will only prove that you belong or not
<br />
to the human race, not that you are actually thinking. Again if you are
<br />
built in such a manner that you can handle properly your environment, I
<br />
will recognize that you can be considered as conscious. All I wanted to
<br />
demonstrate is that it can not be reached by a HLUT as Hans proposed.
<br />
<br />Now what you have probably in mind is an extended &quot;HLUT&quot; (SuperHLUT!) that
<br />
tabulates not only language but all possible inputs histories: visual,
<br />
auditive, internal information like hunger and thirst...and ouputs all
<br />
motor functions, speech, keyboard typing etc...(which would require of
<br />
course much more than 10^(10^13) nodes, and is still more impossible in the
<br />
physical world than the regular HLUT) Would it be conscious ? My personal
<br />
opinion is that the ONLY highly compressed system that is able to do that
<br />
in all imaginable details is ...yourself with the current physical laws. If
<br />
you were able to build a superHLUT with this extended information, he would
<br />
of course have a wrong &quot;idea&quot; of itself because he is a machine and he
<br />
seems to believe to be a human. (Note that ironically, you speak like a
<br />
machine that knows that it is a machine in your last mail, a typical
<br />
reaction of a human who plays to be a machine, not that of a machine
<br />
programmed to look like a human!!) So its reactions are not determined by
<br />
its physical reality, and I postulate that this forbids real consciousness.
<br />
<br />Of course Bruno, I still maintain an idea of external reality!
<br />
<br />Gilles
