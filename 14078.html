<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; this perspective (after all, I have no problem with the idea that the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;problem
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with this is that I don't expect to inevitably 'become' them, they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; separate individuals who happen to have an unusual place in the order of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; human births).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's exactly how I view OM's. It is necessary that they be at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this, since even if they are strung together temporally in some other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way (such as being generated in the same head) they won't form a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuous stream of consciousness unless they have the appropriate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memory relationship. It is also sufficient, since I would have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sense of continuity of consciousness even if my OM's were generated at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different points in space and time.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not talking about whether they are generated at different points in 
<br />
space in time or not from a 3rd-person perspective, I'm talking about 
<br />
whether there is a theory of consciousness that determines some sort of 
<br />
&quot;objective&quot; truths about the temporal flow between OMs from a 1st-person 
<br />
perspective (for example, an objective truth about the relative 
<br />
probabilities that an experience of OM X will be followed by OM Y vs. OM Z), 
<br />
or whether there is no such well-defined and objectively correct theory, and 
<br />
the only thing we can say is that the memories of some OMs have purely 
<br />
qualitative similarities to the experiences of others. Are you advocating 
<br />
the latter?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; But I've always favored the idea that a theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; consciousness would determine some more &quot;objective&quot; notion of temporal 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;flow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; than just qualitative similarities in memories, that if my current OM is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;X
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then there would be some definite ratio between the probability that my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;next
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; OM would be Y vs. Z.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you assume that the probability is determined by the ratio of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;measure of Y to Z, given that Y and Z are equally good candidate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;successor OM's, this takes care of it and is moreover completely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;independent of any theory of consciousness.
</em><br />
<br />But the &quot;theory of consciousness&quot; is needed to decide whether Y and Z are 
<br />
indeed &quot;equally good candidate successor OMs&quot;. For example, what if X is an 
<br />
observer-moment of the actual historical Napoleon, Y is another OM of the 
<br />
historical Napoleon, while Z is an OM of a delusional patient who thinks 
<br />
he's Napoleon, and who by luck happens to have a set of fantasy memories 
<br />
which happen to be quite similar to memories that the actual Napoleon had. 
<br />
Is there some real fact of the matter about whether Z can qualify as a valid 
<br />
successor, or is it just a matter of opinion?
<br />
<br />I also see no reason to think that the question of whether observer-moment Y 
<br />
is sufficiently similar to observer-moment X to qualify as a &quot;successor&quot; 
<br />
should be a purely binary question as opposed to a &quot;fuzzy&quot;  one. After all, 
<br />
if you say the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, and if Y can be described in some 
<br />
mathematical language as a particular computation or pattern of 
<br />
cause-and-effect or somesuch, then you can consider making a series of small 
<br />
modifications to the computation/causal pattern, giving a series of similar 
<br />
OMs Y', Y'', Y''', etc...eventually you'd end with a totally different OM 
<br />
that had virtually no resemblance to either X or Y. So is there some point 
<br />
in the sequence where you have an observer-moment that qualifies as a valid 
<br />
successor to X, and then you change one bit of the computation or one 
<br />
neural-firing event, and suddenly you have an observer-moment that is 
<br />
completely invalid as a successor to X? This seems implausible to me, it 
<br />
makes more sense that a theory of consciousness would determine something 
<br />
like a &quot;degree of similarity&quot; between an OM X and a candidate successor OM 
<br />
Y, and that this degree of similarity would factor into the probability that 
<br />
an experience of X would be followed by an experience of Y.
<br />
<br />In this case, if I am currently experiencing X, the relative probabilities 
<br />
that my next OM is Y or Z might be determined by both the relative &quot;degree 
<br />
of similarity&quot; of Y and Z to X *and* the absolute measure of Y and Z (or it 
<br />
might be even more complicated; perhaps it would depend on some measure of 
<br />
the internal coherence of all the different infinite sequences of OMs which 
<br />
contain X and which have Y or Z as a successor).
<br />
<br />If you have time you might want to take a look at the discussion in the 
<br />
thread &quot;FW: Quantum accident survivor&quot; at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/23eq4g">http://tinyurl.com/23eq4g</a> which 
<br />
got continued in the thread &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; that I 
<br />
linked to earlier at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v">http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v</a> ...in particular, you could 
<br />
look at my posts at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/28fogw">http://tinyurl.com/28fogw</a> and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2hwdfz">http://tinyurl.com/2hwdfz</a> 
<br />
on that thread (and possibly also the post <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3a6k7j">http://tinyurl.com/3a6k7j</a> from 
<br />
the 'Request for a glossary of acronyms' thread which builds on them) where 
<br />
I talk more about this idea that the probability of a given OM being 
<br />
experienced as my &quot;next&quot; one might depend on a combination of its absolute 
<br />
measure and its degree of similarity to my current one, and how this leads 
<br />
to my own pet theory of how one might get a TOE that assigns a unique 
<br />
measure to each OM. But to summarize it here, my pet theory is that there 
<br />
might be a unique self-consistent solution when you impose the above rule 
<br />
about the probability of my &quot;next&quot; OM,  along with a global constraint 
<br />
equivalent to the idea that all the &quot;tanks of water&quot; maintain a constant 
<br />
amount of water in them (with the amount of water standing for the absolute 
<br />
measure of each observer-moment) even as they are constantly giving up water 
<br />
to other tanks (the tanks that stand for possible successor OMs, with the 
<br />
relative amount of water a tank X gives to tank Y vs. tank Z standing for 
<br />
the relative probability that Y vs. Z will be the next experience after X) 
<br />
and receiving water from other tanks (their 'precursor' OMs). This global 
<br />
constraint would give you something like the following system of equations:
<br />
<br />P(A) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; A) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; A) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; A) + ...
<br />
P(B) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; B) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; B) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; B) + ...
<br />
P(C) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; C) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; C) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; C) + ...
<br />
<br />...where A, B, etc. are OMs, P(B) would be the absolute measure of B, and 
<br />
P(A -&gt; B) would be the probability that B would be the successor of A. If 
<br />
you then use the rule that P(A -&gt; B) would be something like S(A, B)*P(B), 
<br />
where S(A, B) is some measure of the &quot;similarity&quot; of B to A which is 
<br />
determined by a theory of consciousness, and P(B) is again the absolute 
<br />
measure of B, then the above system of equations becomes:
<br />
<br />P(A) = P(A)*S(A, A)*P(A) + P(B)*S(B, A)*P(A) + P(C)*S(C, A)*P(A) + ...
<br />
P(B) = P(A)*S(A, B)*P(B) + P(B)*S(B, B)*P(B) + P(C)*S(C, B)*P(B) + ...
<br />
P(C) = P(A)*S(A, C)*P(C) + P(B)*S(B, C)*P(C) + P(C)*S(C, C)*P(C) + ...
<br />
<br />And with each equation you can divide both sides by the expression on the 
<br />
left side, giving:
<br />
<br />1 = P(A)*S(A, A) + P(B)*S(B, A) + P(C)*S(C, A) + ...
<br />
1 = P(A)*S(A, B) + P(B)*S(B, B) + P(C)*S(C, B) + ...
<br />
1 = P(A)*S(A, C) + P(B)*S(B, C) + P(C)*S(C, C) + ...
<br />
<br />This might be enough to uniquely determine all absolute measures P(A), P(B) 
<br />
etc. if your theory of consciousness already told you all the &quot;similarities&quot; 
<br />
S(A, B), S(A, C) etc.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; This leads me to the analogy of pools of water with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; water flowing between them that I discussed in this post:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/07cd5c7676f6f6a1">http://groups.google.com/group/everything-list/msg/07cd5c7676f6f6a1</a>
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Consider the following analogy--we have a bunch of tanks of water, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;tank is constantly pumping a certain amount of its own water to a bunch 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;other tanks, and having water pumped into it from other tanks. The 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ratio
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;between the rates that a given tank is pumping water into two other 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;tanks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;corresponds to the ratio between the probabilities that a given
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;observer-moment will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;succeeded by one of two other possible OMs--if you imagine individual 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;molecules as observers, then the ratio between rates water is going to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;two tanks will be the same as the ratio between the probabilities that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;given molecule in the current tank will subsequently find itself in one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;those two tanks. Meanwhile, the total amount of water in a tank would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;correspond to the absolute probability of a given OM--at any given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;you randomly select a single water molecule from the collection of all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;molecules in all tanks, the amount of water in a tank is proportional 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;probability your randomly-selected molecule will be in that tank.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;Now, for most ways of arranging this system, the total amount of water 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;different tanks will be changing over time. In terms of the analogy, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;would be like imposing some sort of universal time-coordinate on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;multiverse and saying the absolute probability of finding yourself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;experiencing a given OM changes with time, which seems pretty 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implausible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;to me. But if the system is balanced in such a way that, for each tank, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;total rate that water is being pumped out is equal to the total rate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;water is being pumped in, then the system as a whole will be in a kind 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;equilibrium, with no variation in the amount of water in any tank over
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;time. So in terms of OMs, this suggests a constraint on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;between the absolute probabilities and the conditional probabilities, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;this constraint (together with some constraints imposed by a 'theory of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;consciousness' of some kind) might actually help us find a unique
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;self-consistent way to assign both sets of probabilities, an idea I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;elaborated on in the &quot;Request for a glossary of acronyms&quot; thread.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (also see the followup post at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/38g8yt">http://tinyurl.com/38g8yt</a> ...and to see 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; context of the whole thread go to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wsowb">http://tinyurl.com/2wsowb</a> , and for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 'Request for a glossary of acronyms' thread which I mentioned at the end 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the quote go to <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v">http://tinyurl.com/2wah5v</a> )
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So, the requirement that the system be in &quot;equilibrium&quot;, with the total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; amount of water in each tanks not changing over time, means that if you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; randomly select one of all the water molecules in the system &quot;now&quot;, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; probability it will be in any one of the various tanks (corresponding to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; different OMs with a measure assigned) will be the same as if you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;randomly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; select one of the water molecules, then wait a while so that molecule 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; time to travel through a number of successive tanks, and want to know 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the probability is that it will be in the given tank &quot;then&quot;. This means 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; at any moment in a water molecule's history, it will always be likely to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; reach good conclusions if it considers itself to be randomly selected 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the set of all tanks weighted by their &quot;absolute probability&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(corresponding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the absolute measure on each OM), you don't have a situation where
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; there's a special moment where they'll be correct if they reason this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; but their conclusions will grow more and more erroneous if they do so at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; later points in their history, or a situation where there is some global
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; notion of &quot;time&quot; and the absolute probability associated with each tank 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; changing over time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't understand how the probability that a water molecule will be

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a given tank stays constant over time. Sure, the probability that a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;random water molecule is in a given tank is proportional to the volume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in that tank, but once a particular water molecule is identified,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;isn't it increasingly likely as time increases to end up in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;downstream tank, regardless of the volume of the downstream tanks?
</em><br />
<br />You misunderstand--I fully agree that once you pick a water molecule and 
<br />
note that it's in a given tank, say tank A, then finding the probability 
<br />
that it will &quot;next&quot; be in some other tank like B or C is affected by your 
<br />
knowledge that it was last in A, and is not just proportional to the 
<br />
absolute measure (total amount of water) of B or C. What I was saying is 
<br />
that if you pick a random water molecule, then give it enough time to move 
<br />
to another tank, and you want to know the probability that it will be in a 
<br />
given tank such as B, *averaged over all possible tanks it might have been 
<br />
in initially*, then this probability is exactly the same as the probability 
<br />
it was initially in B. This is equivalent to the idea that all the tanks' 
<br />
in-flows and out-flows are in equilibrium, so the amount of water in each 
<br />
doesn't change over time despite the fact that any given water molecule is 
<br />
constantly moving between tanks (which stands for the idea that the global 
<br />
measure on each observer-moment is fixed, there's no notion of the 
<br />
multiverse assigning a different absolute measure to the same OM with the 
<br />
passage of some overarching time parameter). This is also equivalent to the 
<br />
condition I expressed earlier with these equations:
<br />
<br />P(A) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; A) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; A) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; A) + ...
<br />
P(B) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; B) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; B) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; B) + ...
<br />
P(C) = P(A)*P(A -&gt; C) + P(B)*P(B -&gt; C) + P(C)*P(C -&gt; C) + ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;So suppose we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;calculate the absolute probability of different possible OMs being my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;next&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;experience *without* taking into account specific knowledge of what my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;current OM is, by doing a sum over the absolute probability of each OM 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my current experience multiplied by the conditional probability that that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;OM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be followed by the OM whose probability of being my &quot;next&quot; experience
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;we want to calculate.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seems to me that you *have* to take into account specific knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of your current OM in these questions. Your current OM fixes you in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;identity and in time. You don't have to consider that you will turn
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;into a five year old, or into George Bush, even if the multiverse is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;teeming with George Bushes and five year old Jesses. The only OM's you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;need consider for your next experience are those which count as t-now
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;+ delta-t versions of yourself.
</em><br />
<br />Yes, I agree...if my current OM is A and a possible &quot;next&quot; one is B, the 
<br />
probability of my experiencing B next is given by P(A -&gt; B) in the notation 
<br />
above, which is different from P(B). But again, I think you misunderstood 
<br />
what I was saying there, see above for clarification.
