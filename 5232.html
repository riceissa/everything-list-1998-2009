</em><br />
<br /><br />It may not be an error to equate science and ethics. Science continually 
<br />
moves into new domains.
<br />
<br />I'm of the opinion that there is a valid utilitarian theory of 
<br />
co-operating intelligent agent ethics.
<br />
<br />&quot;Utilitarian&quot; because the purpose of the ethical principles can be shown 
<br />
to be &quot;group success&quot;
<br />
(i.e. emergent-system survival / success in the competition with other 
<br />
potential
<br />
variants of emergent intelligent-agent systems that don't include 
<br />
ethical principles as
<br />
behaviour guides for their the agents.)
<br />
<br />Note the subtlety that the utility NEED not be to an individual agent 
<br />
directly, but may only
<br />
accrue to individuals in the group, ON AVERAGE, due to the ethics and 
<br />
moral rules generally
<br />
obeyed by the group members, and the consequent &quot;floating of (almost) 
<br />
all boats&quot;.
<br />
<br />One of the common debates is between ethical/moral relativism versus 
<br />
absolutism.
<br />
I call this a confusion due to oversimplification of the issue, rather 
<br />
than a debate.
<br />
In this regard, this debate is as silly as the nature vs nurture debate 
<br />
and its influence on,say,
<br />
human behaviour, in which the answer is &quot;of course it's a complex 
<br />
feedback loop involving
<br />
the interaction of inherited traits and the accidents of life. Duh!&quot; 
<br />
There is no nature vs nurture.
<br />
It's always nature AND nurture. Arguing about which is more fundamental 
<br />
is truly unproductive
<br />
hair-splitting. We should be researching exactly how the feedback loops 
<br />
work instead.
<br />
<br />So completely analogously, with absolute, and relative morals and ethics.
<br />
<br />My position is that there are absolute ethical principles and moral 
<br />
rules, but  that  those
<br />
are all  general rules, not instantiated rules. (i.e. absolutes in 
<br />
ethics/morals are
<br />
all universally quantified rules that apply to general classes of 
<br />
situations and actions.)
<br />
<br />Relativism is justified in as far as it is simply debate about how the 
<br />
absolute general
<br />
ethical and moral principles should map (do map) onto the current 
<br />
particular situation
<br />
at hand. This mapping may not be simple. A single situation can be 
<br />
boundary-scoped
<br />
differently, for example, or its agents can be seen as engaging in 
<br />
several different kinds
<br />
of acts, with many effects for each act, and the importance to the 
<br />
essence of the situation
<br />
of each act and effect can be debated from different perspectives that 
<br />
involve the interests
<br />
and knowledge of different agents. So the &quot;single&quot; situation may map 
<br />
validly to several
<br />
different instantiations of several ethical principles. And the moral 
<br />
rules applicable to
<br />
the situation may be subject then to legitimate debate.
<br />
<br />Relativism may also question whether some &quot;moralist&quot; group's absolute 
<br />
moral principles
<br />
are general enough, and may argue with some validity that they are not 
<br />
general enough
<br />
to be applied without frequent error (and tragedies of injustice).
<br />
<br />e.g. &quot;Dont Eat Pork&quot;   --&gt; Yeah, whatever
<br />
<br />however,  &quot;Don't eat the kinds of meat that are often rotten and 
<br />
disease-ridden in our climate, like Pork&quot;
<br />
may be a valid moral rule at some historical time and place.
<br />
<br />e.g. &quot;Thou shalt not kill.&quot; --&gt; Well that's an easy to remember 
<br />
simplification, but a little over simplified and too specific.
<br />
How about:
<br />
<br />&quot;Minimize the amount of quality-life-years lost in this encounter.&quot;
<br />
<br />So, &quot;women and children first into the lifeboats. You old geezers are 
<br />
shark-bait.&quot;
<br />
<br />Or.. &quot;Take out the guy wearing the bomb. Now.&quot;
<br />
<br />And relativism is also justified in as far as it is the correct 
<br />
observation that
<br />
many (most) situations of complex interactions beteen multiple 
<br />
intelligent agents can
<br />
be described from multiple perspectives (and/or multiple situation-scope 
<br />
inclusions/exclusions).
<br />
A specific situation can be (probably validly) described as co-incident 
<br />
incidences of
<br />
the several instances of several different general ethical principles.
<br />
<br />A to B
<br />
&quot;Our people have lived here from time immemorial. And your grandfathers 
<br />
killed my grandmother.
<br />
You are pestilent invaders. Get out or we will have a just war against you.&quot;
<br />
<br />B to A
<br />
&quot;Our people have lived here from time immemorial. And your grandfathers 
<br />
killed my grandmother.
<br />
You are pestilent invaders. Get out or we will have a just war against you.&quot;
<br />
<br />Clearly, it is easy to imagine a situation in which both A and B are 
<br />
factually correct, except perhaps in their
<br />
use of the word &quot;just&quot;.
<br />
<br />Most complex interaction situations requiring application of ethics and 
<br />
moral rules are of this kind,
<br />
with competing &quot;goods&quot; or &quot;rights and wrongs&quot;.
<br />
<br />But it is wrong to suppose that this means there can be no absolute 
<br />
definition of right and wrong.
<br />
It's only that only a very general (though clear and simple, at its 
<br />
general level) (and ambiguously mappable)
<br />
absolute definition can be constructed, due to the complexities and 
<br />
variations and multiple valid
<br />
perspectives and situation-scope-choices in the situations to which we 
<br />
want the concepts to apply.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;
<br />
Examples of general ethical principles: (and their mapping problems)
<br />
<br />It is wrong to act against the interests of the group. (But which group, 
<br />
if groups are in conflict?)
<br />
<br />It is wrong to reduce the emergent complex order in your neighbourhood
<br />
(but if different complex orders compete, how do we choose which to 
<br />
promote?)
<br />
<br />While it is alright and perhaps even &quot;good&quot; to compete with other 
<br />
humans, allow the competition to be
<br />
fair and limited and governed, in order that &quot;good games&quot; which generate 
<br />
&quot;boat-floating&quot; value for all
<br />
or many, can be conducted. (But how much competition, versus how much 
<br />
co-operation, is the
<br />
right balance?)
