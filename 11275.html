</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you will excuse my butting in here, but I was passing through on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a different mission
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and became disturbed by reading some earlier posts of this thread.
</em><br />
<br /><br />You are welcome.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My 2 cents worth:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I tend to think that David Nyman has the more sceptically acceptable
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slant on this. Mathematics and logic are constructions of the human
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brain. They are extremely useful, in appropriate contexts, because they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allow effective, efficient and economical representations of processes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the world.
</em><br />
<br /><br />So you assume a primitive world. From this I can already infer you have 
<br />
to distrust the computationalist hypothesis in the cognitive science.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is no particularly good reason however to think that mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; objects exist outside of human brains or phenotypic extensions such as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computers. I think it IS fair to say though that, for example, numbers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and formulae written on a page or blackboard are literal extenstions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the constructs within the active mathematical mind.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I agree. That is what makes the human mind &quot;turing universal&quot;. When it 
<br />
lacks memory space it extends itself through the use of pebble, wall, 
<br />
etc.
<br />
Now, are you really saying that mathematical truth (not the 
<br />
mathematical expression that humans have developed to talk about that 
<br />
mathematical truth) is a human's construct. Would you say that the 
<br />
number 17 was not a prime number at the time of the dinosaurs?
<br />
In which case you distrust the &quot;Arithmetical realism&quot; part of comp, and 
<br />
you are remarkably coherent.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That so much of what occurs in 'the world' CAN be represented by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numbers and other mathematical/logical objects and processes, is better
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expained by assuming that the great 'IT' of noumenal nature is actually
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; made up of many simple elements [taken firstly in the general sense].
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This underlying simplicity which yet combines and permutates itself
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; into vast complexity, is something we infer with good reason - it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; works!
</em><br />
<br />This would make sense if you can specify those simple elements.
<br />
Have you heard about Bell, Kochen and Specker and other weird facts 
<br />
predicted and verified from quantum mechanics. I am afraid such simple 
<br />
elements are already rule out empirically, eve, with the Many World 
<br />
assumptions.
<br />
Now even mentioning quantum mechanics, I refer to my work (see the URL) 
<br />
for an argument showing that the hypothesis that we are turing emulable 
<br />
at some level (whatever that level) entails the laws of physics have to 
<br />
be explained without assuming a physical primitive world.
<br />
Of course this refutes the current Aristotelian Naturalistic paradigm, 
<br />
but does rehabilitate Plato and the neoplatonist conception of matter 
<br />
(Plotinus).
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But you cannot DEDUCE from it that numbers and other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematical objects exist 'out there', except in those particular
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regions of space time that happen now to be mathematically active
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brains.
</em><br />
<br />I do not believe that a number can exist &quot;somewhere&quot;.  It can be 
<br />
implemented or incarnate somewhere, like a chess game, but that is 
<br />
different.
<br />
Also, this is assumed in the comp hyp, nobody pretends that we can 
<br />
deduce that number exist. Actually it can be proved about the natural 
<br />
number in particular that no theories at all can prove that they exist. 
<br />
All theories enough rich to talk about numbers have to assume them 
<br />
explicitly or implicitly.
<br />
But they does not need to exist out there or elsewhere: this is a 
<br />
category error. Numbers are not located in time or space, nor are they 
<br />
eternal. Poetically we could say that numbers and their relations are 
<br />
beyond time and space. But I recall, this is among the comp assumption. 
<br />
What we discussed is the fact that if we take comp seriously enough 
<br />
then physics can be derived from number theory/ computer science.
<br />
<br />Bruno
