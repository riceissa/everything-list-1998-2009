</em><br />
<br />I understand your point, but I think you are making an invalid assumption 
<br />
about the relationship between a random sampling of all the OM's available 
<br />
to an individual and that individual's experience of living his life. 
<br />
Suppose a trillion trillion copies of my mind are made today on a computer 
<br />
and run in lockstep with my biologically implemented mind for the next six 
<br />
months, at which point the computer is shut down. This means that most of my 
<br />
measure is now in the latter half of 2005, in the sense that if you pick an 
<br />
observer moment at random out of all the observer moments which identify 
<br />
themselves as being me, it is much more likely to be one of the copies on 
<br />
the computer. But what does this mean for my experience of life? Does it 
<br />
mean that I am unlikely to experience 2006, being somehow suspended in 2005?
<br />
<br />More generally, if a person has N OM's available to him at time t1 and kN at 
<br />
time t2, does this mean he is k times as likely to find himself experiencing 
<br />
t2 as t1? I suggest that this is not the right way to look at it. A person 
<br />
only experiences one OM at a time, so if he has &quot;passed through&quot; t1 and t2 
<br />
it will appear to him that he has spent just as much time in either interval 
<br />
(assuming t1 and t2 are the same length). The only significance of the fact 
<br />
that there are &quot;more&quot; OM's at t2 is that the person can expect a greater 
<br />
variety of possible experiences at t2 if the OM's are all distinct.
