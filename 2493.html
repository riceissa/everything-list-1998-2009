This time I'll repeat only a fraction of the 500 lines in your reply:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From marchal.domain.name.hidden:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Suppose you &quot;survive&quot; only through a simulation of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the big bang at the level of the quantum superstring, membrane, etc. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then the &quot;correct level of substitution&quot; is the level of the quantum
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; superstring, membrane, etc. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember the definition of COMP, it says that *there exists* such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; level. It does not say that &quot;this&quot; or &quot;that&quot; *is* the correct level.
</em><br />
<br />Ok.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It is a sort of admission of ignorance. This ignorance is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fundamental. Indeed it  has been shown (independently by a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; lot of people---ref in my papers) that comp entails we cannot
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know the correct levels. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We can bet on it, though, and we can make reasoning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relatively to correct bets.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Normally a constructive philosopher should abandon comp right here,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it follows from that theorem that we cannot be machine in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any constructive sense.
</em><br />
<br />Which theorem? Send pointer to its proof. Not to its informal
<br />
description, but to its proof. 
<br />
<br />(One reason why I doubt this: isn't the lowest possible level - embodied
<br />
by what's computable in the limit - sufficient? Why not run all universes
<br />
GTM-computable in the limit?  If one of them is ours, then the set-up
<br />
is constructive.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You miss the point. Even the one who as PI on his T-shirt is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wrong if he believes PI helps him to predict the issue of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; next self-duplication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that if the program remains as lenghty as the sequence, as it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; happens for most Schmidhubers---in the iterated self-duplication,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; these sequence are called uncomputable by Solovay, Chaitin, etc.
</em><br />
<br />Not uncomputable. Any past is finite. So it is at worst random or
<br />
&quot;Martin-Loef-random&quot; or incompressible.  None of those you cite is
<br />
careless when it comes to the difference between countable and uncountable
<br />
sets. None claims one can compute a continuum by dovetailing. Dovetailing
<br />
will be forever limited to the countable realm.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Is there a probability distribution on this set
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;(if not, you cannot predict anything)? Which one?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You talk really as if probability was the only manner you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; know for quantifying uncertainty.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Beside probability there exist other ways to handle the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncertain. The one I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the best is Dempster-Shafer theory. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I have work some years with expert in that field).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not only I do not restrict myself to the uniform distribution, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't share your assumption that the only way for quantifying 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; uncertainty is probability. Why not Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence ?
</em><br />
<br />The various Dempster-Shafer (DS) approaches are no alternatives
<br />
to probability theory. They are extensions designed to facilitate
<br />
handling of uncertainty in contexts where lack of belief does not imply
<br />
disbelief. But DS is essentially about hulls confining sets of
<br />
traditional distributions, and thus compatible with the traditional
<br />
framework of Bayesian statistics. (Variants of DS that are not yield
<br />
paradoxical results.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In the first part of my thesis:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am not pretending that I have solved the mind-body problem, nor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the problem of the origin of the physical laws, nor the QCU.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I have rigorously proved that with comp these problems are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equivalent.
</em><br />
<br />It is this recurring type of claim I find so irritating: &quot;rigorous 
<br />
proof&quot; without formal framework. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; A weakness is that I am lead toward hard mathematics.
</em><br />
<br />What a strange remark. The weakness of your texts is that they are
<br />
so informal.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Which unique formalisation? Please write it down!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;How can you possibly isolate it by informal reasoning? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was talking *there* about the modal logic G, G*, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; S4Grz, Z1, Z1*, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; These formal logics are intensional (modal) variation of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; provability logics  of the sound  self-referentially correct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine. I have provide semantics, and theorem provers.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; See explanation and technical details in my thesis and in my 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; papers.
</em><br />
<br />Your thesis is in French. Your papers are informal. They always include
<br />
sentences such as: &quot;Actually such proof and clarification is one of the
<br />
main result in my thesis ... without going into details I will briefly
<br />
try to convey the main line of the argument&quot; (p 4 of paper dated sept
<br />
24, 2000).  Then follow informal examples, references to philosophers,
<br />
and unsubstantiated claims such as &quot;the UD generates all real numbers&quot;,
<br />
when it only generates all their finite prefixes, which is a fundamental
<br />
difference.
<br />
<br />Then there is your &quot;invariance lemma: the way you quantify 1-indeterminacy
<br />
is independent of (3-)time, (3-)place, and (3-)real/virtual nature of the
<br />
reconstitution.&quot; This does not make sense, because if the (3-) probability
<br />
distribution on the possible futures and reconstitutions does depend on
<br />
time or place or other things (why not?) then 1-indeterminacy does so,
<br />
too. Under most distributions, some futures are less likely than others.
<br />
Hence there are nontrivial, distribution-dependent, probabilistic
<br />
1-predictions as well as &quot;quantifications of 1-indeterminacy&quot; that depend on
<br />
time/space/other things.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are also telling us that informal classical mathematics is vague 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because they admit sets like the set of all functions from one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; infinite set to another. I am not the one isolated here in making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sense of these sets. You cannot pretend I am the one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pretending 1+1=3! It is a dishonest rhetorical trick.
</em><br />
<br />no comment
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Those who have patiently follow the steps are in general quite 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shocked by the conclusion (the reversal),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but then, at least, they act honestly: either searching or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hoping for a precise flaw,  or just abandoning comp. 
</em><br />
<br />have not met anyone whom you shocked - cannot comment on this
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It looks like it does not occur to your mind that *perhaps* 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have a point and that you just don't have seen it yet.
</em><br />
<br />I have been hoping you have a nontrivial point - the only reason 
<br />
why I kept encouraging you to explain yourself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why not trying being a little more modest, mister &quot;I-am-right&quot;. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Have you a prejudice against 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the whole approach or what ?
</em><br />
<br />I am prejudiced against claims of rigorous proof when even the 
<br />
assumptions are unclear; and against statements that are plain 
<br />
wrong, such as &quot;the UD generates all real numbers&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Algorithmic TOEs are about computable probability distributions on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;universe histories computable in the limit.  Such histories subsume
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;all computable evolutions of all computable observers, including the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;conscious ones, if there are any.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You ask me to give a formal definition of delay when I use it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the every-day life folk sense, and you are willing to talk
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on consciousness without clarification ????
</em><br />
<br />Please read again. If &quot;consciousness&quot; is indeed a well-defined concept,
<br />
and if there are any &quot;conscious&quot; computable observers, then they will be
<br />
computed. Otherwise they won't. In either case there is no need to define
<br />
consciousness - I have not seen a convincing definition anyway. Similarly,
<br />
there is no need to define &quot;love&quot;, although it might be an important
<br />
concept to certain computable observers in certain computable universes.
<br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The exchange between Bruno and Juergens is, I believe, instructive and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;constructive as it forces them to refine their positions.
</em><br />
<br />Where did I have to refine mine?
