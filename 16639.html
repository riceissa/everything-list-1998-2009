<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The hard problem may be unsolvable, but I think it would be much more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unsolvable if we don´t fix the easy problem, isn´t?
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think that the hard problem is more easy to solve than the easy 
<br />
problem.
<br />
Indeed it is a theorem in computer science that an (ideally) correct 
<br />
universal machine which introspects itself (in the usual mathematical 
<br />
self-referential (Lobian) sense) will discover (not prove, but still 
<br />
&quot;produce as true&quot;) many non machine-communicable statements.
<br />
<br />AUDA gives a thorough precise theory of qualia, which is Popper 
<br />
refutable, in the (idealist) sense that the quanta appears as 
<br />
particular type of sharable first person plural qualia. If it appears 
<br />
false on quanta, we can abandon that theory of qualia too!
<br />
<br />What is cute in AUDA, is that it provides an explanation why the &quot;hard 
<br />
problem of consciousness&quot; has to seem &quot;hard&quot; from the point of view of 
<br />
the machine. In a sense the hard problem is proved to be unsolvable by 
<br />
any direct means, but completely &quot;meta-solvable&quot;.
<br />
<br />It relies mainly on the Gödel points where Penrose and Lucas are wrong: 
<br />
machine *can* access their own incompleteness theorem through local 
<br />
self-consistency assumptions.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; With a clear idea
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the easy problem it is possible to infer something about the hard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For example, the latter is a product of the former, because we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; perceive things that have (or had) relevance in evolutionary terms.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Second, the unitary nature of perception match well with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; evolutionary explanation &quot;My inner self is a private reconstruction,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for fitness purposes, of how others see me, as an unit of perception
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and purpose, not as a set of processors, motors and sensors, although,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; analytically, we are so&quot;. Third, the machinery of this constructed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inner self sometimes take control (i.e. we feel ourselves capable of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; free will) whenever our acts would impact of the image that others may
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have of ourselves.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If these conclusions are all in the easy lever, I think that we have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; solved a few of moral and perceptual problems that have puzzled
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; philosophers and scientists for centuries. Relabeling them as &quot;easy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problems&quot; the instant after an evolutionary explanation of them has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been aired is preposterous.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Therefore I think that I answer your question: it´s not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; information; It´s about a certain kind of information and their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; processor. The exact nature of this processor that permits qualia is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not known;
</em><br />
<br /><br />I think we know (assuming comp) the exact nature of that &quot;processor&quot;. 
<br />
It is an immaterial universal machine. The machine does not need to be 
<br />
Lobian (as some people think). It needs only to be lobian to be able to 
<br />
develop by its own this very special theory of qualia and quanta.
<br />
<br />I agree with your critic of &quot;consciousness = information&quot;. This is &quot;not 
<br />
even wrong&quot;, and Kelly should define what he means by &quot;information&quot; so 
<br />
that we could see what he really means. I suspect Kelly is confusing 
<br />
&quot;information&quot; and &quot;information content&quot;. Information content needs the 
<br />
(immaterial and atemporal) processing of a universal machine or number. 
<br />
Not a physical processing, but a processing similar to those in the UD, 
<br />
or implemented naturally in (a tiny part) of Arithmetic.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  that’s true, and it´s good from my point of view, because,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for one side, the unknown is stimulating and for the other,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reductionist explanations for everything, like the mine above, are a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit frustrating.
</em><br />
<br /><br />I can explain in what sense comp is a vaccine against reductionism, but 
<br />
you have to be familiar with the UD Argument. Even the physics which 
<br />
appears cannot be reduced, still less the person. Hmm ..., you still 
<br />
believe we can have both comp and a primitive material universe, isn't 
<br />
it?
<br />
<br />Computationalism leads to a genuine non trivial and refutable solution 
<br />
of both the hard problem of matter *and* the hard problem of 
<br />
consciousness. It preserves the necessity of an irreducible gap between 
<br />
those things (and other things), but it provides a geometry of that 
<br />
gap, together with an explanation of the mystery feeling. Of course (in 
<br />
case you have read some of my older post), the geometry of the gap is 
<br />
provided by the possible modal semantics of the logic G* \minus G, and 
<br />
its intensional variants, (all this on the Sigma_1 restriction, to take 
<br />
into account the comp hyp and the Universal Dovetailer in Arithmetic).
<br />
<br />The bad news is that the &quot;easy problem&quot; of matter and consciousness, 
<br />
thorugh comp could as well be as diificult as possible. It remains 
<br />
possible that only very long computation can lead tp present form of 
<br />
human mind and matter. Computationalism does not just reverse math and 
<br />
physics, or theology and physics, it reverse hard and easy ...
<br />
<br />Eventually everything is reduced to the (deep) mystery of our 
<br />
understanding of an assertion like N = {0, 1, 2, ...}.  But, by 
<br />
accepting that the expression &quot;N = {0, 1, 2, ...}&quot; makes sense,  we can 
<br />
explain in all detail why this one is absolutely unsolvable. We cannot 
<br />
explain the elementary &quot;infinity quale&quot;.
