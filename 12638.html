John, I guess my brain is generating my consciousness, but I regard this as a contingent fact. My conciousness is that which I experience, and if I found myself continuing to have similar experiences despite teleportation, brain transplant, resurrection in Heaven or whatever, then I would have survived as me. Note that I am not saying these things are possible (perhaps this is where you are scornful of the fantastic scenarios), just that IF in these situations I continued to think I was me, THEN ipso facto, I would still be me, despite losing the original body and brain.Stathis PapaioannouFrom: jamikes.domain.name.hidden: everything-list.domain.name.hidden: Re: ASSA and Many-WorldsDate: Fri, 26 Jan 2007 15:54:32 -0500

&nbsp;&nbsp;concluding sentence is&gt; &quot; But my brain just won't let me think this

&nbsp;&nbsp;way.&quot;&gt; *&gt; Have you been carried away?&gt; Who is &quot;your 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;brain&quot; to make decisions upon you? (maybe you mean only that the mechanism of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;your brain, the main tool &quot;YOU&quot;  use in mental activity, is not 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;predesigned for such action?) So: is there a pre-design (ha ha)?&gt; More 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;importantly: who is that &quot;me&quot; in conflict with 'your'  brain?&gt; How 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;do you 'want' to 'think' something (which involves your brain) when 'your 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;brain' won't let it happen?&gt; OK, let's introduce &quot;you&quot;, the homunculus, 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;who wants to think some way and your 'brain' did not reach the sophistication 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the design (yet?) to comply - as a reason for &quot;won't let me&quot;.&gt; With 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;what 'tool' did &quot;you&quot; WANT to &quot;think this way&quot;? How many people are you 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed?&gt; *&gt; I am asking these stupid qiestions in the line of my 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;search for SELF (&quot;I&quot;), vs. the total interconnectedness of our personal 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;existence with 'the rest of the world'. I expect that you may provide useful 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;hooks for me in such respect.&gt; John&quot;I&quot; am the product of a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness-generating mechanism, my brain, in the same way as &quot;walking&quot; is 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the product of a locomotion-generating mechanism, my legs. &quot;I&quot; am not 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;identical to my brain just as &quot;walking&quot; is not identical to my legs. Now, of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;course &quot;I can only think what my brain will let me think&quot;, and of course &quot;I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;can only walk where my legs will let me walk&quot;, but these statements are not 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;tautologies in the way that saying &quot;I can only think what I can think&quot; or &quot;I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;can only walk where I can walk&quot; are. Stathis Papaioannou-----------------------------------
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;JM:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;so you consider the biologic tissue-grown (stem-cell 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;initiated) BRAIN the origin of a thinking person? Life growing out from 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'matter' - which is the figment of our explanatory effort to poorly and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;incompletely observed impact received from parts unknown? Funny: you invested 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;so many posts into the (partial) teleportation and copying into other 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;universes - did you really MEAN
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the transfer of tissues (like in StarTrek?) How 'bout the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;multiple  'copying' of matter?  How can you duplicate the atoms for 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;copying? StarTrek had only 1 copy and that, too, by 'physical' 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;transfer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the wrong conclusion: I am not defending this line, I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;find it unreal and just mention the position of yours and others on this list 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;for argument's sake. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it 'interesting, but amazing' that different brains 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(see: the multiplicity of humans and other animals among themselves) behave 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;like mental clones in accepting very similar &quot;3rd person views&quot; into their 1st 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;person ideas, to form images of the 'material world' etc. Mental images, that 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is, which, however you would make into their own origination? Are we 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;all (and the world, the existnce etc.) only fiction of ourselves? 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then again I feel that the 'consciousness' you generate by 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the brain may be very close to personality, self, the &quot;I&quot; we are talking 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;about. Which would close the loop:  &quot;there must be the 'primitive matter' 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;forming the brain and out of that comes the 'not-so-primitive' matter, the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;mental complexity and all&quot;??? 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree withBruno to disagree in the absolute primitive 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;matter concept. IMO 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is only an explanatory imaging in this universe's 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;consciousness activity to order the part of the system we so far detected. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Together with space-time and OUR pet-causality - the 'within model' 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;ordering.
