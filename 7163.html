<br />Yes, it makes sense, but only because we know that the phrase &quot;Who  
<br />
would I have been&quot;, uttered by Steve Jobs, is just a convenient way  
<br />
for expressing a third-person proposition, &quot;What would have happened  
<br />
to Steve Jobs if...&quot;.  Which in turn is also a short way of asking  
<br />
about the whole world, i.e., &quot;What would the world have been like if  
<br />
Steve Jobs had been adopted by someone else&quot;.  The part of the world  
<br />
that's the main target of this question is the part that wears  
<br />
turtlenecks, makes Apple computers and calls itself Steve - so here  
<br />
it just gets replaced by &quot;I&quot;.   But logically, by asking &quot;who would I  
<br />
have been&quot;, Steve's not inquiring into anything that a third-person  
<br />
observer could not also inquire into.
<br />
<br />The apparent problems can be solved by translating these questions  
<br />
into third-person terms.  for example,
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; So yes, if you can imagine what it would have been like to eat  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; else for breakfast, then you should be able to imagine what it  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been like to be born as someone else.
</em><br />
<br />For breakfast:  what would have happened to the world (especially the  
<br />
Steve Jobs part of the world) if Steve Jobs had had something else  
<br />
for breakfast?
<br />
For birth:  what would the world be like if Steve Jobs hadn't been  
<br />
born, but his biological parents had had some other child?
<br />
<br />There's no sense in asking &quot;what if I was born as someone else&quot;, no  
<br />
more than there is asking &quot;what would Steve Jobs be like if Steve  
<br />
Jobs had never been born?&quot;  But there is sense in asking what would  
<br />
be different about the world.  The problems here all come from  
<br />
overzealous emphasis on the &quot;first person perspective&quot;.  In other  
<br />
words, I think the mistake is made by asking the question &quot;what would  
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt;it&lt; have been like&quot;, instead of the question &quot;what would &gt;the  
</em><br />
world&lt; have been like&quot;.  The thing that the &quot;it&quot; refers to (a first- 
<br />
person perspective, presumably) is not a thing that exists in the  
<br />
world framed by the question.
