<br />My feeling is that you are putting too much in &quot;my&quot; 1st person notion.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    A relationship between a computation and another mathematical

<br />What relationship, what mathematical structure ?

<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;in which the properties of the latter are similar in the right ways 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(presumably a mapping satisfying restrictions) ...
</em><br />
<br />How could that works ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the former that for many 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;practical purposes (such as consciousness) we can regard the existance of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the latter as having the same effect as the existance of the former, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;addition to any other possible effects such as those due to considering more 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;than one implementation mapping.  
</em><br />
<br />I will search for an aspirin ...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You know where to find my thoughts on how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to restrict the mappings.
</em><br />
<br />Yes but I don't see how that defines an implementation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sounds like Platonism, but doesn't define existence.
</em><br />
<br />I use &quot;existence&quot; as a quantifier, like in logic, not as a property which
<br />
need a definition.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Why is 10,000 such an important number for you?  
</em><br />
<br />It is a Chinese way to say &quot;a lot&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Surely 666 is the only 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;# that holds the key to existence.  (Just kidding!)
</em><br />
<br />No. The key number of existence is 24.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Except that U is undefined. All Universes are indeed in Plato's heaven, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;none are material. They appears material to their inhabitant, that's all.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Suppose instead they are all &quot;material&quot; by hypothetical logical 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;necessity.  Tell me what would be different.  (i.e. define &quot;material&quot;.)
</em><br />
<br />The point is that they would be no difference, and that is why I don't
<br />
believe in matter and I don't need to search a definition of it.
<br />
Now I was a little quick in saying that all Universe are in Plato's
<br />
heaven. I should have said only that all apparence of universes are in
<br />
plato heaven, and this only through the &quot;eyes&quot; of Heaven's inhabitant.
<br />
Matter and Universes are just sort of superstitions. (With COMP).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;No. measure are relevant for inhabitant relatively to their computational 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;histories. And that need &quot;trans-univers&quot; reasoning. (A good thing, because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;without that there would be no hope for a computationalist explanation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;quantum interferences).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    I guess by &quot;relatively&quot; you mean there is no objective measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distribution...  
</em><br />
<br />Not at all!!!!  The measure is objective, and objectively relative. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;...Sorry, that won't cut it.  Without an objective measure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;distribution you can say nothing about what a typical observer would see.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(For example, you can't explain Darwin.)
</em><br />
<br />I agree. But I repeat that comp entails the existence of an objective
<br />
measure (from which the laws of physics supervenes), and that this
<br />
measure is or can be shown to be necessarily (and objectively) relative.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The &quot;All Computation + comp&quot; *is* quasi-falsifiable. Mmmh...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    How?  (I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;comp&quot; though, since you like to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;talk about whether &quot;you&quot; survive substitutions but did not define &quot;you&quot;.)
</em><br />
<br />Then forget computationalism and think about computationalists! In that
<br />
case you can follow the entire UDA without any other definition than
<br />
the computationalist *belief*: &quot;me is the guy who will survives with
<br />
an artificial digital body&quot;. And what I show is that, if the 
<br />
computationalist is honnest and patient, he will understand that 
<br />
physics is a branch of machine's psychology. Then he will perhaps
<br />
appreciate how, by the interview of the sound machine (and its
<br />
miraculous Solovay Guardien Angel) he can actually derive the mathematical
<br />
structure of the observable proposition. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Everett never 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;defined &quot;machines&quot;, which is why his formulation leads to &quot;paradoxes&quot; like a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stationary state being able to be &quot;conscious&quot;.
</em><br />
<br />This seems to be an interesting remark. Could you developpe it a
<br />
little bit. Could you tell me which passage of Everett you are refering?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    First, memory (which he [Everett] deals with) is nothing like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the kind of &quot;flow&quot; QTI freaks talk about.
</em><br />
<br />What do you mean by &quot;flow&quot;? There is only states of consistent
<br />
machines and the (big) class of their consistent computational
<br />
extensions appearing in UD*.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Everett derives the first person plural probability from the third
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;person SE.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    NO!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    He 'derived' objective effective probabilities, &quot;3rd person&quot; in your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strange language (and I don't mean French).  ('' indicate his derivation 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;itself was flawed, but that's not important here.)
</em><br />
<br />Read DeWitt &amp; Graham page 63seq. He says for exemple (emphasis by
<br />
Everett):
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;However, we do not do justice to the theory of pure wave mechanics
<br />
until we have investigated what the theory itself says about the
<br />
*appearance* of phenomena to observers, rather than hastily concluding
<br />
that the theory must be incorrect because the actual states of systems
<br />
as given by the theory seem to contradict our observations.
<br />
We shall see that the introduction of observers can be accomplished
<br />
in a reasonable manner, and that the theory then predicts that the
<br />
*appearance* of phenomena, as the subjective experience of these
<br />
observers, is precisely in accordance with the predictions of the
<br />
usual probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />As you can see the probabilities are subjective and belong to the
<br />
appearance, to the first person, with my &quot;strange&quot; language.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;You need to realize that the notion of &quot;1st person&quot; used on this list is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just an extra-crackpot version of mind-like hidden variables that has no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;basis in objective reality:
</em><br />
<br />Refer me to a post where &quot;1st person&quot; is used as  mind-like 
<br />
hidden variables.
<br />
And recall me what you mean by &quot;objective reality&quot;.
<br />
Recall that for me objective reality is just arithmetical truth.
<br />
(The first person plenitude appears then (with comp) as
<br />
a very (very, very, very) big thing in comparison with which
<br />
even Deutsch multiverse looks like a tiny dust grain).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    That's not an objective measure distribution if it depends 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on you...
</em><br />
<br />Let us say it is conditionalised by &quot;me&quot; (my history).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;.. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;said there is one unique objective measure distribution - if you don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe it you must believe in hidden variables and other crackpot nonsense. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  There is no other consistent possibility (except, you could believe in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;both).
</em><br />
<br />I dislike hidden variables. But by reading your post I am
<br />
more and more willing to belief in the existence of crackpot nonsense :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Ridiculous, I am not talking to a thought.
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    For practical purposes, of course we identify a person with a body that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gives rise to many thoughts.
</em><br />
<br />I hope you realise I never identify a person with a body. I bet on the
<br />
presence of an owner of most human bodies, but as you know with comp we
<br />
can change our body for another. 
<br />
The person is neither the body nor the thought, but the owner of bodies
<br />
and thoughts.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; What does differentiate different people?
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Memories. Cosmological, genetical, individual memories. I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;say. Most of the time there are organized into histories, so I could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;have said simply: Histories. Isn't it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Suppose my memory is a set of bits.  A cosmic ray comes in and flips one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bit.  Did the ray kill me and create a new person?  If so, OK, but no QTI.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If not what if it keeps happening?  I could end up with identical memories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to a completely different person.  So, really, there is no distinction 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between 2 people.
</em><br />
<br />So you agree that, provided that there is no end for the human race,
<br />
you *are* immortal, because if there is no distinction between two
<br />
people, there is no distinction between you and any of our descendants,
<br />
isn't it?
<br />
<br /><br />Jacques :-)
