<br />
Interesting, and I agree with the last paragraph: making good choice
<br />
increases the measure of the region of the multiverse where good choices
<br />
have been made and everyone is better off.
<br />
An alternative view of which I am thinking a lot is that our conscious
<br />
thought processes actually take place in the multiverse, our perceived
<br />
conscious thought processes (Lockwood's &quot;mind&quot;) being a shadow of our &quot;true&quot;
<br />
more complex thought processes (Lockwood's &quot;Mind&quot;). Also in this case we can
<br />
think that a Mind is happier when more and more minds are happy.
<br />
But in general, I have difficulties seeing the point of mixing deep
<br />
philosophical thinking with the ethics of everyday's life: I choose to try
<br />
making my loved ones happier, and I wish to do my best to make everyone
<br />
happier, I don'r really need QM to justify and defend this choice. When it
<br />
comes to ethics I choose to see myself as a &quot;simple&quot; being with free will in
<br />
a &quot;simple&quot; universe.

Subject: Re: Extended Response on Modern Physical theory as a basis for
<br />
Ethical and Existential Nihilism
<br />
<br />Here is an excerpt from a message I sent to the list last week, which
<br />
argues that nihilism is not an appropriate response to multiverse physics.
<br />
<br />As far as the issue of human action and free will, here is how I look
<br />
at it.  There are really two issues.  The first is that in some sense
<br />
the multiverse makes our actions deterministic.  That is, there is no
<br />
longer any true unpredictability in what we do, because we do everything
<br />
in one universe or another.  So how can we have free will if there are
<br />
no choices?
<br />
<br />Well, this problem has been considered many times in the philosophical
<br />
literature going back hundreds of years (where it was asked how free will
<br />
was compatible with God's omniscience).  Recent works by Daniel Dennett,
<br />
his books Elbow Room and his new book (which I haven't read) Freedom
<br />
Evolves, discuss how free will can be said to coexist with determinism.
<br />
The basic idea is that the acting out of deterministic processes and the
<br />
considerations involved in making a free choice are two equally valid ways
<br />
of explaining the same phenomenon, at different levels of description.
<br />
These books could be good sources to explore these concepts further.
<br />
<br />The second part of the problem is specific to the multiverse model,
<br />
which is, even assuming that in some sense you have free will, what is
<br />
the practical point of acting, since your decisions will be in effect
<br />
cancelled out by being done differently in other universes?  Larry Niven's
<br />
science fiction short story All the Myriad Ways explores the problems
<br />
which sweep society when a technology is invented to visit parallel
<br />
universes, leading to a widespread surrender to nihilism and social ennui.
<br />
<br />However this perspective ignores the concept of measure, where some
<br />
universes are more prominent than others.  Although you may make
<br />
different choices in different universes, the probabilities are not equal.
<br />
Your decision making processes influence the measure of the universes in
<br />
which your different choices occur.  By giving matters careful thought
<br />
and making wise decisions, you can maximize the measure of the universes
<br />
in which your choices have good outcomes.  This justifies the necessity
<br />
of careful choice and eliminates the descent into nihilistic horror
<br />
and despair.
<br />
