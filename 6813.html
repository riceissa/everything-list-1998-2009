I thought the following analogy might clarify the point I was trying to make 
<br />
in recent posts to the &quot;Many Pasts? Not according to QM&quot; thread, addressing 
<br />
one objection to QTI.
<br />
<br />You are a player in the computer game called the Files of Life. In this game 
<br />
the computer  generates consecutively numbered folders which each contain 
<br />
multiple text files, representing  the multiple potential histories of the 
<br />
player at that time point. Each folder F_i contains N_i files. The first 
<br />
folder, F_0,  contains N_0 files each describing possible events soon after 
<br />
your birth. You choose one of the  files in this folder at random, and from 
<br />
this the computer generates the next folder, F_1, and places in it N  files 
<br />
representing N possible continuations of the story. If you die going from 
<br />
F_0 to F_1, that  file in F_1 corresponding to this event is blank, and 
<br />
blank files are deleted; so for the first  folder N_0=N, but for the next 
<br />
one N_1&lt;=N, allowing for deaths. The game then continues: you  choose a file 
<br />
at random from F_1, from this file the computer generates the next folder 
<br />
F_2  containing N_2 files, then you choose a file at random from F_2, and so 
<br />
on.
<br />
<br />It should be obvious that if the game is realistic, N_i should decrease with 
<br />
increasing i, due  to death from accidents (fairly constant) + death from 
<br />
age related disease. The earlier folders  will therefore on average contain 
<br />
many more files than the later folders. Now, it is argued that  QTI is 
<br />
impossible because a randomly sampled observer moment from your life is very 
<br />
unlikely to  be from a version of you who is 1000 years old, which has very 
<br />
low measure compared with a  younger version. The equivalent argument for 
<br />
the Files of Life would be that since the earlier  files are much more 
<br />
numerous than the later files, a randomly sampled file from your life (as  
<br />
created by playing the game) is very unlikely to represent a 1000 year old 
<br />
version of you, as  compared with a younger version. This reasoning would be 
<br />
sound if the &quot;random sampling&quot; were  done by mixing up all the files, or all 
<br />
the OM's, and pulling one out at random. But this is not  how the game works 
<br />
and it is not how real life works. From the first person viewpoint, it  
<br />
doesn't matter how many files are in the folder because you only choose one 
<br />
at each step, spend  the same time at each step, and are no more likely to 
<br />
find yourself at one step rather than  another. As long as there is at least 
<br />
*one* file in the next folder, it is guaranteed that you  will continue 
<br />
living. Similarly, as long as there is at least *one* OM in your future 
<br />
which  represents a continuation from your present OM, you will continue 
<br />
living.
