<br />It will be interesting and exciting if you are right, but I think the

kind of AI you describe above and below is further off than 10-30 
<br />
years, though perhaps not 50 years.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really think it's going to come up with anything as awkward and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; overcomplex
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as our current physics theories?
</em><br />
<br />I have no idea. True, it may come up with all sorts of weird theories. 
<br />
But, absent new experimental evidence, will these new theories actually 
<br />
tell us anything new?
<br />
<br />Your point about AIs exploring physics is an interesting one. And you 
<br />
are right that Egan has his AIs, his uploaded Orlandos and even his 
<br />
computer-produced Yatima, looking very much like humans. Not at all 
<br />
like the &quot;Entities&quot; of Vinge's &quot;Deepness,&quot; Zindell's &quot;Neverness,&quot; or 
<br />
Stephenson's &quot;Hyperion&quot; series. But let us imagine that an advanced AI 
<br />
were to be turned loose on a Newtonian world. I can well imagine that 
<br />
such an entity, left to its own devices, might come up with weird names 
<br />
for inertia, mass, friction, etc. Perhaps even synthetic combinations 
<br />
of what we take to be the basic vectors of classical mechanics. Instead 
<br />
of 3-space being so primal, phase spaces of 6, 18, and even many more 
<br />
dimensions would perhaps be more &quot;natural&quot; to such a mind. (Needless to 
<br />
say, given that today's best AI programs and computers are having a 
<br />
very hard time even doing &quot;naive physics,&quot; a la ThingLab and its 
<br />
descendants, I'm not expecting progress very quickly. And ThingLab is 
<br />
more than 20 years old now, so expecting massive breakthroughs in the 
<br />
next 10-20 years seems overly optimistic.)
<br />
<br />More importantly, would an AI version of classical physics, complete 
<br />
with incomprehensible (to us) phase spaces and n-categories and so on, 
<br />
including constructs with no known analogs in our current universe of 
<br />
discourse, would this version give any predictions which differ from 
<br />
our own? In short, would the AI's version of physics give us any new 
<br />
physics?
<br />
<br />My hunch is no. It might be better at solving some problems, just as 
<br />
the mental architecture of birds may give them much better abilities to 
<br />
solve certain kinds of 3D problems than we have had to evolve, and so 
<br />
on for many other such examples, but would the physics be different or 
<br />
new?
<br />
<br />I will grant that had such minds existed earlier in the development of 
<br />
physics they might have anticipated certain things decades or centuries 
<br />
ahead of humans, so I will grant that in this sense they might have 
<br />
found &quot;new physics.&quot; And hence I will grant that perhaps an alien mind, 
<br />
or an AI mind, might be able to look at what we have already measured 
<br />
with our machines and may be able to see new physics we have not found.
<br />
<br />Interesting topic, to be sure.
<br />
<br />(On a tangent, we also have some experience with non-Western cultures 
<br />
coming to modern science with their own &quot;alien intelligence&quot; (to a 
<br />
slight extent, not a fraction of the alien intelligence a non-H. 
<br />
Sapiens would have) and we can examine the question of whether their 
<br />
non-Western outlook gave them any particular insights into science or 
<br />
fresh points of view. My verdict is that no, the non-Western outlooks 
<br />
were not particularly important. Sure, Gell-Mann drew some ideas of the 
<br />
&quot;Eightfold Way,&quot; but the group-theoretic developments were there 
<br />
anyway. Ditto for Eastern ideas of other sorts, I think. And ditto for 
<br />
the feminist notion that masculine ideas apparent in physics need to be 
<br />
supplemented with more feminine, nurturing, holistic kinds of crapola. 
<br />
But I am in danger of digressing into political topics, which I don't 
<br />
want to do here on this list.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suspect our current physics theories are overcomplex because they're 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on extrapolating into the microworld, mathematics and intuitive 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; concepts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that originated primarily in models of our everyday physical world.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Particle theory... wave theory ... path integrals. There are no 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particles,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; waves or paths down there....   There is no &quot;observation&quot; either....  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; strings.  No membranes.  Our attempts to project these concepts onto an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; inappropriate domain may well strike future quantum-domain-natural 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minds as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mildly hilarious...
</em><br />
<br />Probably so. But at any given point in time the best we can do is to do 
<br />
the best that we can. We of course cannot just wait for the machines...
<br />
<br />Whether there &quot;are&quot; branes and strings and spins and suchlike at the 
<br />
Planck scale is unknown to me, but physicists seem to be making 
<br />
progress in acting as if such things have some meaning.
<br />
<br />The universe is not a rubber sheet, either, but it can help to think of 
<br />
gravity with the rubber sheet model (though an Arcturan squid creature 
<br />
might use a Flozzleblet to picture gravity, and an AI might use 
<br />
something entirely different).
<br />
<br />It is true that taking the &quot;at hand, all around us&quot; experience we have 
<br />
with physical objects and with the logic of physical objects is 
<br />
problematic at the quantum level. The fact that small things do not 
<br />
behave the way rocks and spoons behave, being either here or not here, 
<br />
having some speed which can be measured, etc., is why quantum mechanics 
<br />
is so weird to newcomers and others. So, yes, the physical world is not 
<br />
really made of rubber sheets or strings or little blue balls called 
<br />
electrons. But the fact that reality is so weird is not, in my opinion, 
<br />
an argument of any kind that we should not try to make some sense of it 
<br />
with the best arsenal of tools and concepts we can gather.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Humans may or may not arrive at a workable TOE before the advent of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; AI's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with quantum-level sensors and actuators.  Following this advent, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; however,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the progress of fundamental physics will be unimaginably fast, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will move
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in humanly-unimaginable directions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Will mathematics be central to this new physics?  Maybe.  But not our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mathematics.
</em><br />
<br />I disagree fairly strongly on this point. I think our mathematics is 
<br />
what is most lasting, albeit the mathematical ideas change names and 
<br />
new ideas become more important.
<br />
<br />And I expect the mathematics the AIs develop, or that alien cultures 
<br />
may already have, will look like a &quot;coordinate transformation&quot; on our 
<br />
space of mathematical basis vectors. Their categories may be slightly 
<br />
different, but the underlying structure will be similar. (If natural 
<br />
transformations are what &quot;slide&quot; one category and its morphisms into 
<br />
other categories and morphisms, 2-categories, 3-categories, and 
<br />
n-categories in general are the tools for looking at how these natural 
<br />
transformations slide around.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, this was part of why I decided to start thinking about AI 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than fundamental physics ;-&gt;
</em><br />
<br />AI remains interesting, but I think new views of physics will be coming 
<br />
from AIs long after other important things come out of AI. Just my 
<br />
opinion.
<br />
<br />(For example, some friends of mine are doing interesting work on using 
<br />
systems of several million machine agents to data mine large amounts of 
<br />
financial data. It seems likely that this kind of work on machine 
<br />
learning, pattern extraction, support vector machines, and a plethora 
<br />
of other &quot;AI tools&quot; will have major effects on the world of economics 
<br />
and forecasting. And on creating financial derivatives (synthetics) 
<br />
which are alien to human thinkers/investors.)
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think Greg Egan's fiction is great, but I also think Diaspora is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; badly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flawed futorology, because his uploaded minds never get tremendously 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intelligent than humans.  I don't think that's a very realistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prognostication, though it makes for easier storytelling.
</em><br />
<br />I totally agree. His characters were all recognizably human. Where were 
<br />
the entities with the equivalent of a truly alien intelligence, or with 
<br />
an IQ of 1000? (Not of course in the sense of thinking 5-7 times faster 
<br />
than the average bright person on this list, but of having many times 
<br />
the difference in conceptualizing power than an Einstein or a Wolfram 
<br />
has over a 100 IQ drone.)
<br />
<br />Where were the &quot;Jupiter-sized brains&quot; so beloved of the Extropians and 
<br />
Transhumanists?
<br />
<br />Vinge would say, apropos of your &quot;easier storytelling&quot; point, that such 
<br />
minds are on the other side of some flavor of Singularity, with little 
<br />
to say except to say that there are &quot;Entities&quot; out there, brooding and 
<br />
thinking their deep alien thoughts like some kind of unseen Lovecraft 
<br />
monster.
