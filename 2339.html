<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Hello.  I finally wrote my paper for the Plank Symposium (which I spoke

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at in October).  In it I propose a new critereon for implementation of a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; computation, and mention the everything-list.  I put the paper on my site at

<br />It has many interesting ideas and covers a lot of ground but seems a little
<br />
unfocused.  A few random comments:
<br />
<br />The issue of what constitutes an implementation is complex and difficult
<br />
to understand unless you have read the relevant papers as background.
<br />
Hopefully your audience is familiar with the issue otherwise your paper
<br />
is hard to understand.
<br />
<br />All these physically-oriented proposals have an ad hoc flavor, an
<br />
attempt to &quot;cook the books&quot; to get the answers we want.  They do not
<br />
flow naturally from first principles.
<br />
<br />I like your suggestion to pursue the question of whether one computation
<br />
simulates another.  This gets away from the physical world and forces
<br />
us to focus on more fundamental issues.  If you could come up with a
<br />
persuasive way of answering this question you might then be able to
<br />
leverage that and improve the analysis of implementation.  For example,
<br />
if a clock implements every program, then a counting program simulates
<br />
every program.  Find a way to reject the latter and you are on your way
<br />
to rejecting the former.
<br />
<br />The overall program you are proposing is defined here:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose, hypothetically, that the problems in defining a unique and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proper implementation criterion can be overcome. The next step in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;applying computationalism to quantum mechanics would then be to see
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the appearance of the standard rules for probability could be
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;derived using the wavefunction without collapse.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such probabilities would only be effective probabilities, because
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is nothing non-deterministic in the model to be considered. An
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effective probability in this context is defined as the ratio of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the number of observations of a given type to the total number of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;observations. In this case, this will be a ratio of the number of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;implementations of a computation of a given conscious type to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;number of implementations summed over all conscious types.
<br />
<br />As a practical matter, this plan has so many obstacles to overcome that
<br />
it looks hopeless.  Not only do you have to resolve the issue of when
<br />
an implementation has occured (which is of doubtful success), you then
<br />
need to define what class of computations constitute conscious observers
<br />
suitable to your needs.  This second problem is equally contentious and
<br />
far from resolution today.
<br />
<br />Any such definition, if could ever be agreed upon, is going to be highly
<br />
complex.  Now you have to go from this characterization of consciousness
<br />
to try to relate what constraints it puts on how the wave function should
<br />
be said to split.  I don't see how you could possibly expect to come
<br />
up with meaningful statements about quantum theory which are contingent
<br />
upon whatever specific aspects of a computation render it conscious.
<br />
<br />This struck me as funny:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disturbing possibility is that the measure of a brain (the # of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ways in which it could be said to implement its regular computation)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could depend on the size or structure of the brain. It is conceivable,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for example, that a creature could be constructed which thinks
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a human, but whose brain does not implement its computation,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as mathematically defined, in nearly as many ways. Such a creature
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would be at great risk of enslavement by regular humans. The opposite
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scenario would also be possible. It is to be hoped that measure is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not sensitive to the details of the construction of a brain.
<br />
<br />Presumably your concern is that if people come to believe that a
<br />
particular creature's brain has less measure than others, we should care
<br />
less about the welfare of that creature, and so would feel comfortable
<br />
in enslaving it, since its suffering wouldn't matter.  It seems absurd
<br />
to imagine that the majority of people would allow these untestable
<br />
philosophical musings to drive their ethical judgement on such an
<br />
important issue.
<br />
<br />Anyway, even if it happened, by your own arguments, mistreatment would
<br />
be justified, hence there is no reason to hope for the contrary.
<br />
<br />Overall I think there are interesting ideas here, but the problem
<br />
that it is working towards is so difficult that I don't think it can
<br />
succeed as a practical matter.  Some QM approaches such as &quot;many minds&quot;
<br />
try to accomplish much the same task without hoping to solve all these
<br />
insurmountable philosophical problems.  They look for wavefunction
<br />
splits that provide basic properties that would allow for causality,
<br />
consistency, memory, etc.  These are simpler principles and more likely to
<br />
put practical and meaningful constraints on wave function decomposition.
<br />
