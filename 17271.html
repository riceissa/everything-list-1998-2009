Brent and 1Z (the &quot;twins&quot;...a dynamic duo of blunt skepticism):

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's silly.  If my wife's car won't start and I explain that it's out of gas, that's

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; really an explanation even if I don't know why it's out of gas.  he operational
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; definition of an explanation of an event is what you would do to effect or prevent that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; event.
</em><br />
<br />Oh.  Is that what we're interested in here?  Operationally defined explanations?
<br />
<br />I apologize.  I had not realized.  I thought we were discussing deeper
<br />
issues.  So sure, if you want to stick to &quot;operational explanations&quot;,
<br />
things are pretty straightforward.  Physics is indeed the language for
<br />
operational explanations and perhaps we should confine ourselves to
<br />
discussions of the latest developments in physics.  I propose a name
<br />
change, from the &quot;Everything List&quot; to &quot;Everything Physics-related
<br />
List&quot;.
<br />
<br />Though, actually, I thought that we were discussing the *ultimate*
<br />
underlying nature of reality.  Not operational explanations that
<br />
provide us with strategies for avoiding car problems in that reality.
<br />
So, upon further reflection, I think I'm in the right list.  You,
<br />
however, may not be.
<br />
<br />Okay, sarcasm over, though I think my point above is valid.
<br />
<br />BUT, actually I do very much appreciate your response, as it forces me
<br />
to examine, clarify, and articulate my own thoughts.  Which is the
<br />
whole point of this exercise I think.  So, the only thing worse than a
<br />
negative response is no response!  Ha!
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In general there are multiple things you could do and hence multiple causes of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an event.
</em><br />
<br />There are many ways the history of the world could have played out
<br />
differently that would have resulted in your wife's car not having an
<br />
empty gas tank (many of them quite gruesome) but if physicalism is
<br />
correct then there's only ONE way the world DID play out...and that is
<br />
the causal structure that led to your wife's situation.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; The image of a causal chain leading back to an ultimate link is misleading - it is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more like causal chain mail that branches out as you trace it back.
</em><br />
<br />I follow your meaning, but it just means that the chain is a directed
<br />
acyclic (presumably!) graph, that can be divided into layers, with
<br />
each layer viewed as a link in the chain.  But there must be a base
<br />
layer, right?  An infinite past is a possibility too, I suppose, but I
<br />
don't think that negates my argument, it just changes the wording a
<br />
bit.  But let's not go there just yet.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But just because you can't trace it back to a single ur-cause doesn't nullify
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my advice to my wife to put gas in the tank.
</em><br />
<br /><br />Okay, two scenarios:
<br />
<br />1)  Physicalism is true, you're in the real world, and your wife ran out of gas.
<br />
<br />2)  Physicalism is true, you're in a computer simulation of the real
<br />
world, and your virtual-wife ran out of virtual-gas.
<br />
<br />SO, in both scenarios, your operational approach to explanation is
<br />
useful.  But it isn't meaningful in the context of what I take us to
<br />
be discussing:  the underlying nature of reality.
<br />
<br />Your operational explanations have SUBJECTIVE MEANING.  Not absolute
<br />
meaning.  If they had absolute meaning, then they wouldn't apply in
<br />
both scenario 01 and scenario 2.
<br />
<br />My point is that there IS NO absolute meaning.  And where there is no
<br />
meaning, there can be no explanation.  In an absolute sense, things
<br />
just are what they are.  Tautology.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; BUT if we take an identical block of granite to be something that just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; exists uncaused, like our universe, then there can be no explanation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There can in the same way QM explains the decay of unstable nuclei.  That's what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cosmogonists are searching for.
</em><br />
<br />Same argument as above.  QM is a theoretical framework that is
<br />
consistent with our observations.  As such, it has subjective meaning,
<br />
since observations are subjective.
<br />
<br />Anywhere you subjectively make the same types of observations that you
<br />
make here on earth, then QM will be a good framework to use when
<br />
attempting to anticipate future events.  Even if you are *really* in a
<br />
computer simulation.
<br />
<br />What are unstable nuclei?  They are nuclei that have lower energy
<br />
configurations that they can relatively easily be jostled into.  Why
<br />
are those other configurations lower energy?  Why the relative ease of
<br />
jostling?  Why does there exist a phenomenon capable of jostling in
<br />
the right way?  Because that's the way things work in this universe.
<br />
Apparently.
<br />
<br />But if the laws of physics were different, then what we observed would
<br />
be different.  If physicalism is true, maybe there are yet other
<br />
universes with different physical laws out there where all nuclei are
<br />
stable.  Unstable nuclei just cannot form under those alternate laws.
<br />
Seems possible, right?
<br />
<br />The existence of unstable nuclei is consistent with our observations.
<br />
Even if they don't actually exist, using them as theoretical
<br />
constructs makes sense when thinking in terms of QM, which we
<br />
ultimately only bother to do because it makes useful predictions.
<br />
It's useful.  Even if we were actually in a computer simulation being
<br />
run on an alien computer in an alternate universe whose physical laws
<br />
didn't produce unstable nuclei, for our subjective purposes inside the
<br />
simulation, we would want to talk about unstable nuclei, because they
<br />
fit our simulated observations, and it's easier to think in terms of
<br />
unstable nuclei rather than in terms of mathematical equations which
<br />
could be interpreted as such.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Ultimately your answer is:  unstable nuclei decay because that's what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; unstable nuclei do.  Tautology.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, it's not a tautology because there is an underlying theory that explains why some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nuclei are stable and some aren't and exactly how unstable they are.
</em><br />
<br />No, it's a tautology because it just takes what we observe and
<br />
restates it in an alternate form without supplying any absolute
<br />
explanation for why it should be that way.  It only gives us a
<br />
subjectively useful &quot;operational explanation&quot;.  See above.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If conscious experience is uncaused and acausal, then in some sense
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; knowledge is irrelevant.  Your uncaused experience could be of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believing that you &quot;know&quot; something which is actually false (e.g.,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; that 121 is prime).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you suppose you have uncaused experiences?
</em><br />
<br />A trap?  Nice try, Mr. Meeker.
<br />
<br />I don't think that there is a reason I suppose this.  That's just the way it is.
<br />
<br />I have the subjective feeling that it is because I've had the
<br />
conscious experience of concluding:
<br />
<br />1)  Physicalism has an explanatory gap
<br />
<br />2)  Platonism, which initially seemed better, also has an explanatory gap
<br />
<br />3)  Uncaused things cannot have meaning or explanations in an absolute sense
<br />
<br />4)  All causal explanations of consciousness ultimately lead to uncaused origins
<br />
<br />5)  Things which follow entirely from uncaused beginnings are
<br />
themselves ultimately uncaused
<br />
<br />6)  Therefore, one way or another, directly or indirectly,
<br />
consciousness is uncaused.
<br />
<br />7)  Given the choice between directly uncaused or indirectly uncaused,
<br />
I'll take directly uncaused.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; If conscious experience is caused, then knowledge is...still
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; irrelevant.  But for a different reason...in this case what you *can*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; know is determined by those external causes.  You could be caused to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; believe that you *know&quot; something which is actually false (e.g., that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 121 is prime).  But if you then trace the causal chain back, you will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; never find what ultimately caused you to be wrong
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do you think this?  Maybe I found 121 in a table of prime numbers that was erroneous.
</em><br />
<br />What caused the table to be erroneous?  What caused that?  What caused
<br />
what caused that?  Etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Maybe a friend told me 121 was prime.
</em><br />
<br />What caused him to do that?  Etc.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe my calculator malfunctioned due to a cosmic ray hit.
</em><br />
<br />Why are the laws physics that we observe such that cosmic rays are
<br />
generated and calculators are susceptible to malfunctioning when hit?
<br />
What caused your calculator and the comic ray to be in the same place
<br />
at the same time and thus collide?  What caused you to use a
<br />
calculator instead of just remembering that 11 * 11 is 121?  What
<br />
caused what caused all these things?  Etc.
<br />
<br />1Z...that's my response to your post as well.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why would I try to phrase my answer in terms of &quot;the ultimate cause&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Because you want to understand the underlying nature of reality?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why would I even suppose there is such a thing as &quot;the ultimate cause&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Human nature?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And why would the absence of an ultimate cause have any relevance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to my explanation in terms of proximate causes?
</em><br />
<br />It would have no relevance to that particular &quot;operational
<br />
explanation&quot;.  But we're not here to discuss operational explanations.
<br />
&nbsp;That's for physics blogs.
<br />
<br />Further, we're not here primarily to discuss what kinds of entities
<br />
might exist which would also be consistent with our observations AND
<br />
subjectively useful in our operational explanations.  That's also for
<br />
physics blogs.
<br />
<br />We're here to discuss what really is.  Absolute explanations that
<br />
account for &quot;Everything&quot;, the entire ontological stack of what exists.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm getting at with all of this &quot;uncaused&quot; stuff, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the equivalence between an uncaused universe and just an isolated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; uncaused conscious experience?  At all?  Anyone?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nope.
</em><br />
<br />How about now?  Even if you don't agree, surely you see?
