<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ultimate case of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and as such exhibits no change of any kind, per definition. What

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then is the origin of, at least, the illusion of change?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [Charles]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I suspect the answer is that only beings which inhabit such a world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are capable of 1st person experience. It's hard to imagine (a) what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1st person experience would mean for a being which didn't have any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of memory, and (b) how any sort of being could come into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; existence *except* in a world with an arrow of time (given that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; living organisms contain a frozen history of their evolution, just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; as their brains contain a history of their experiences).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While the world can be considered a block universe for the purposes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of explaining physical phenomena (and making sense) this doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessitate that the linkage between the &quot;snapshots&quot; making up the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; block universe - what we call the laws of physics - should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; themselves create a world in thermodynamic equilibrium, even if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Platonia itself is completely unchanging (having no time direction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in which to change).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There are, I think, explanations at two different levels involved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; here. The &quot;frog's-eye&quot; and &quot;bird's-eye&quot; views don't have the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; form, and shouldn't be confused.
</em><br />
<br />That's something along the lines of what I would have written. You managed
<br />
to keep your hands tied down however!
<br />
<br />OK, let's suppose we are sim's of Platonia. In particular, let's suppose
<br />
that us and the world around us are represented by the computational
<br />
histories of Platonic Turing Machines.
<br />
<br />When a TM that supports a sim &quot;executes&quot; steps (quotes cause we're in
<br />
Platonia), the contents of its tape change and the read-write head moves
<br />
(I'll spare you the quotes on change and move). When we look at a snapshot
<br />
of the tape, what is on that tape are zeroes and ones (of course, Platonia
<br />
doesn't care whether its apples and oranges on the tape). We are represented
<br />
by some of those zeroes and ones. As you have noted, those zeroes and ones
<br />
will contain records of what happened in prior snapshots on the tape. There
<br />
will also be records of our thoughts and beliefs. Some of those beliefs will
<br />
be of time and some of consciousness. The snapshot, however, is totally
<br />
static; it in itself does not support consciousness, it is just ones and
<br />
zeroes. Similarly the next snapshot is static and the glue that holds the
<br />
two snapshots together can be totally described by a static bit-string which
<br />
encodes the TM.
<br />
<br />It does not seem like we can find our first person experience in this; it's
<br />
all just zeroes and ones! Apples and oranges even. But that's just
<br />
incredulity. I think the pertinent question to ask is: why do sequences of
<br />
zeroes and ones on the tape develop the belief of consciousness?
