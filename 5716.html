I do not understand the UD well enough to comment on it, so I'll stick 
<br />
with the OP computer.  It has as part of it's description the means by 
<br />
which it attains infinite processing power.  This is, of course, 
<br />
critical because there is a big difference between being able to do 
<br />
something in principle, and having an actually working theory as to how 
<br />
that thing can be done (infinite processing power in this case).  My 
<br />
idea is that if you accept this description of the universe, questions 
<br />
of how or when the process started become something akin to &quot;where does 
<br />
the circle start&quot; or &quot;when does infinity start&quot;.  It is a cycle that 
<br />
comes back on itself endlessly and explains itself.  The gap in 
<br />
understanding is in trying to understand an infinite thing.  The OP by 
<br />
definition becomes timeless when it reaches infinite processing power, 
<br />
removing it from a &quot;beginning and an end.&quot;  It timelessly cycles.  
<br />
Therefore, asking &quot;Is this fundamental reality leading up to a virtual 
<br />
reality,&quot; or &quot;was anything ever real?&quot;  is really just asking yourself 
<br />
where you are on the circle.  These concepts melt into each other as the 
<br />
cycle completes- VR creates reality and reality creates VR- endlessly.
<br />
<br />Regarding your point about the &quot;universe&quot; expanding forever, if you 
<br />
accept MWI, then there must be universes that appear identical to ours 
<br />
that will ultimately collapse just as predicted in the OP theory.  Correct?

<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Assuming MWI is correct, and that Tipler's Omega point theory is correct 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in that in at least some portion of the multiverse there will exist the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;physical capacity for a computer to exist with infinite computing power, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;even in the confines of a finite universe,  does this then allow for an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;eternally self-recreating universe with no outside explanation necessary?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think there are some problems with this, which I'll get to in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;moment.  But first it is good to keep in mind that current cosmological
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observations contradict Tipler's predictions.  There is strong evidence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the universal expansion is increasing and that there will be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;collapse and no Omega Point.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Specifically, the question is whether the Omega point computer could 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;simulate the birth of a new, fully intact multiverse and run it through 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;to the creation of a new virtual omega point computer, that would then 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;continue the process in an endless cycle (or chain)?  Does one computer 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;with infinite computing power (and only a millisecond to exist from an 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;objective viewpoint) allow for this infinite layer of creation?  Does it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;matter whether the multiverse itself is infinite or just very large?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I see a few problems with this.  First, the OP computer could in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;fact simulate many universes, including those different from itself.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Perhaps it could even simulate all possible universes.  So its actions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't go too far in explaining why it, itself, exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Second, if you study the details of the OP you learn that it is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difficult time to live.  It is not a stable situation.  Life will grow
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exponentially more difficult as the collapse intensifies.  At the same
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time, life grows perhaps exponentially more powerful, so there would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be reason to hope that it could manage to survive forever.  However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this is not assured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In particular, there is no guarantee that the OP computation project
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will be maintained forever.  The beings in charge of the computer might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;change their minds and start using it to play video games.  Or survival
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;may become so challenging that they can't waste their time simulating all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;possible universes, or even their own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Keep in mind that even though it only takes a finite amount of time from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the outside, the appropriate time scale is the internal one, and that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one lasts forever.  The OP is the product of life and intelligence, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for this model to work, these entities must live forever and run their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;computer forever.  Literally, forever and ever and ever.  That's the only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;way the philosophical model works.  Such stability seems inconsistent
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the nature of life and intelligence as we know it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Third, it's not clear how exactly this explanation works.  If the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universe is real, it doesn't need to simulate itself in order to exist.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If it isn't real, the fact that it simulates itself doesn't seem like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;enough to bring it into existence.  I can imagine no end of universes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that simulate themselves, in fact most of them would have a much easier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time of it than the OP beings struggling with their chaotic collapse.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does that mean they are all just as real as our universe would be, if
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the OP's simulations were what made us real?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In fact among the simplest of such self-simulating universes is Bruno's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Universal Dovetailer, a trivial program which runs all programs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(including, by definition, itself).  If the OP brings itself into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;existence, so does the UD, which is much simpler.  And the UD then makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;us exist along with all other universes, whether the OP turns out to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cosmologically plausible or not.
