<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one level I agree with him. But they are surely derived from the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contingent characteristics of experience, and AFAICS experience in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; context reduces to the contents of our brains. So 'infinite sets' is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just a model (brain material at another level of description) which IMO
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counts as a 'physical notion' unless you start off as an idealist. Put
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; simply, you can't think mathematical thoughts without using your brain
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to instantiate them - and you don't literally have to instantiate an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'infinite set' in the extended sense in order to manipulate a model
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the formal characteristics you impute to this concept. In fact,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the inability to convert infinite and transfinite sets into physical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; notions is excellent empirical evidence that they *don't* exist in any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literal sense -  they don't need to, as their usefulness is as limit
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cases within models, not as literal existents (nobody has ever
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; literally deployed an infinite set).
</em><br />
<br />A particular concrete (brain) instantiation of a mathematical concept
<br />
can't be equivalent to the math concept itself.  I pointed out that
<br />
many different physical processes can implement the *same* algorithm -
<br />
this shows that the mathematical concept of the algorithm can't be
<br />
identified with any particular physical instantiation of it.  Read up
<br />
on the failure of simple Identity theories of mind.  Surely you
<br />
understand the difference between a *Class* (an abstract actegory) and
<br />
an *Object* (a particular instance of the concept).?  The Class is not
<br />
the object
<br />
<br />That's the first part of the argument for platonism. (1)   The second
<br />
part of the argument is the argument from indispensibility - you can't
<br />
remove mathematical concepts from theories of reality because some
<br />
concepts (like inifnite sets for example) can't be converted into
<br />
physical notions. (2)  It's the combination of (1) and (2) that
<br />
clinches it.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is a thoroughgoing contingentist position, and I don't see that it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can be refuted except by rejecting contingentism and starting from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; idealism. But then you've begged what you're trying to prove.
</em><br />
<br />Aren't you guilty of the same thing?  You're simply assuming that
<br />
materialism is the ultimate metaphysics and trying to reduce everything
<br />
to that.  You do this because the human brain is only capable of
<br />
representing *physical* things in conscious experience.
<br />
<br />But what is a *physical* thing really?  For instance is the *length* of
<br />
the computer screen in front of you an objective value?  Someone moving
<br />
close to light speed perpendicular to your computer screen would record
<br />
a quite different value for the length of your computer screen than you
<br />
would.  This suggests that the physical form is not objectively real.
<br />
What *is* objectively out, is a 4-dimensional world-time for your
<br />
computer screen as described by general relativity.... but this 4-d
<br />
world-time is a *mathematical* concept.
<br />
<br />One could imagine an alien race or a super-intelligence which had no
<br />
consciousness of physical things, but *sensed* everything purely in
<br />
*mathematical* terms.  For instance imagine if they a way to *directly
<br />
sense* 4-d world-lines.  Then it might be 'obvious' to alien
<br />
philosophers that mathematical things were objevtively real.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  'If according to the simplest explanation, an entity is complex and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; autonomous, then that entity is real.' ('The Fabric Of Reality', Pg 91)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Autonomous of what precisely? In what sense is a mathematical concept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; autonomous of your brain, or the collection of brains and other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; recording devices that instantiate it? Remember that we're talking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about mathematical *concepts* - i.e. things we can grasp - it's merely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a metaphor to claim that these models *refer* to autonomously existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic realities. Either a metaphor, or the presumption of such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platonic reality, not its proof.
</em><br />
<br /><br />See (1) and (2) above.  If the postulation of some entity *simplifies*
<br />
our explanations of reality, then this provides (probabilistic)
<br />
evidence that the postulated eneity exists.  (Occams razor).  The
<br />
evidence for the existence of platonic entities is that they simplfiy
<br />
our models of reality.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; As Detusch points out, mathematical entities do appear to match the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; criteria for reality: 'Abstract entities that are complex and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; autonomous exist objectively and are part of the fabric of reality.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; There exist logically necessary truths about these entities, and these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comprise the subject-matter of mathematics.'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Truths are only equivalent to 'existents' for an idealist. Fair enough,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but then this has to be accepted axiomatically, or not at all. I can't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; honestly see why this is so hard to grasp.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; David
</em><br />
<br />I certainly wouldn't equate Platonism with Idealism!   We don't seem to
<br />
accept anything 'axiomatically'.  Instead we look to see which
<br />
postulated entities simplify our explanations of reality the best.
