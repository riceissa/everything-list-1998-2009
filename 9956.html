<br />Huh ? They have non-zero mass-energy. That's all

physicists need. Was that a solipsist's &quot;proved&quot; ?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; In books and laboratories I see only relation between numbers, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eventually they are related to personal qualia, like the feeling to see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a needle on some apparatus.
</em><br />
<br />Looks like it was
<br />
<br />IOW, having assumed solipsism, you can find no way out of it.
<br />
<br />Well, you can: you can assume the Platonic existence of numbers,
<br />
even though numbers as such don't feature in your experience.
<br />
<br />But if you are entitled to do that to find a way out
<br />
of solipsism, the materialist is entitled to assume matter.
<br />
<br />(Or even posit substance as necessary to explain the phenomenal flow
<br />
of time, as Kant did).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You seem to believe it is easier to make consciousness emerged or just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; related with stuffy things.
</em><br />
<br />Some kinds of non-mathematical stuff are needed to resolve
<br />
the HP problem, to explain time, to explain phenomenality
<br />
and so on. The point is to posit enough to explain the universe
<br />
as we experience it and then stop.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  How and why? Many philosophers of mind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agree that a pain or any qualia are not something localized.
</em><br />
<br />I'm not one of them.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  A pain is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already immaterial,
</em><br />
<br />There is no basis for saying that whatosever.
<br />
Only living organisms feel pains, and organisms
<br />
are material.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that is why so many accept the comp hyp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (perhaps without seeing the consequences of it): it is easier to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; explain (or to tackle an explanation) of consciousness (immaterial)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from something immaterial (like numbers or relations between numbers)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than on something material.
</em><br />
<br />So can you give the mathematical formula for the colour
<br />
purple, or the taste of honey ? Of course not!
<br />
<br />The mind-body problem boils down to reconciling phenomenality with
<br />
mathematical* descriptions, not with matter pre se!
<br />
<br />Consciousness is a problem for all forms of materialism and physicalism
<br />
to some extent, but it is possible to discern where the problem is
<br />
particularly acute. There is no great problem with the idea that matter
<br />
considered as a bare substrate can have mental properities. Any
<br />
inability to have mental proeprties would itslef be a property and
<br />
therefore be inconsistent with the bareness of a bare substrate. The
<br />
&quot;subjectity&quot; of consciouss states, often treated as &quot;inherent&quot; boils
<br />
down to a problem of communicating one's qualia -- how one feesl, how
<br />
things seem. Thus it is not truly inherent but depends on the means of
<br />
communication being used. Feelings and seemings can be more readily
<br />
communicated in artistic, poetice language, and least readily in
<br />
scientifi technical language. Since the harder, more technical a
<br />
science is, the more mathematical it is, the communication problem is
<br />
at its most acute in a purely mathematical langauge. Thus the problem
<br />
with physicalism is not its posit of matter (as a bare substrate) but
<br />
its other posit, that all properties are phycial. Since physics is
<br />
mathematical, that amounts to the claim that all properties are
<br />
mathematical (or at least mathematically describable). In making the
<br />
transition from a physicalist world-view to a mathematical one, the
<br />
concept of a material substrate is abandoned (although it was never a
<br />
problem for consciousness) and the posit of mathematical properties
<br />
becomes, which is a problem for consciousness becomes extreme.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Especially when we don't know what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;material&quot; really means.
</em><br />
<br />It means the substrate of properties, contingent existence, endurance
<br />
through time, and hence real change, unactualised potential and causal
<br />
interaction.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope you agree that the mind/body problem is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not yet solved. My point is just a reformulation of it in the comp
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; frame. Then I got partial solutions.
