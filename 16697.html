<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What do you thing is the more probable events that you will live which

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one is the more probable? What is your most rational choice among
</em><br />
<br />So if nothing is riding on the outcome of my choice, then it seems
<br />
rational to choose the option that will make me right in the most
<br />
futures, which is option 6, white noise.  If there's one world for
<br />
each unique pattern of pixels, then most of those worlds will be
<br />
&quot;white noise&quot; worlds, and making the choice that makes me right in the
<br />
most worlds seems as rational as anything else.
<br />
<br />Though, if there is something significant riding on whether I choose
<br />
correctly or not, then I have to decide what is most important to me:
<br />
minimizing my suffering in the worlds where I'm wrong, or maximizing
<br />
my gains in the worlds where I'm right.
<br />
<br />If there isn't significant suffering likely in the losing worlds, then
<br />
I will be much more likely to base my decision on the observed or
<br />
calculated probabilities, as Papineau suggests.
<br />
<br />BUT, if there is significant suffering likely in the worlds where I
<br />
lose, I might very well focus making a choice that will minimize that
<br />
suffering.  In which case I will generally not base much of my
<br />
decision on the &quot;probabilities&quot;, since it is my view that all outcomes
<br />
occur.
<br />
<br />However, going a little further, this assumes that I only make one
<br />
bet.  As I mentioned before, I think that I will make all possible
<br />
bets.  So, even if I make the &quot;safe&quot; suffering-minimizing bet in this
<br />
branch, I know that in a closely related branch I will make the risky
<br />
&quot;gain-maximizing&quot; bet and say to hell with the Kellys in the losing
<br />
worlds.
<br />
<br />So I know that even if I make the safe bet, there's another Kelly two
<br />
worlds over making the risky bet, which will result in a Kelly
<br />
suffering the consequences of losing over there anyway.  So maybe I'll
<br />
say, &quot;screw it&quot;, and make the risky bet myself.
<br />
<br />Ultimately, it doesn't matter.  Every Kelly in every situation with
<br />
every history is actualized.  So my subjective feeling that I am
<br />
making choices is irrelevant.  Every choice is going to get made, so
<br />
my &quot;choice&quot; is really just me taking my place in the continuum of
<br />
Kellys.
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I am asking you, here and now, what do you expect the most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; probable experience you will feel tomorrow, when I will do that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; experiment.
</em><br />
<br />So to speak of expectations is to appeal to my &quot;single world&quot;
<br />
intuitions.  But we know that intuition isn't a reliable guide, since
<br />
there are many aspects of reality that are unintuitive.  So I think
<br />
the fact that I have an intuitive expectation that things will happen
<br />
a certain way, and only that way, is neither here nor there.
