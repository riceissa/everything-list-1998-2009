Hi, I am new to this list.
<br />
<br />I am glad to see that there are others interested in Tegmark's ideas.
<br />
I have been aware of his ideas since October but have largely agreed
<br />
with them since prior to that. by that I mean that I had reasoned to
<br />
similar conclusions prior to leaning that they had been so well
<br />
developed and articulated by Tegmark. There are a few problems that I
<br />
see with the MUH paper, although it could be that I just do not
<br />
entirely understand all of it. Before I mention those I will just say
<br />
that I believe his main thesis is correct. That is, his theory
<br />
explains correctly the relationship between mathematics and physics,
<br />
the reason why it is that mathematics has been so &quot;unreasonably
<br />
effective&quot; at describing natural phenomena. I with the idea that the
<br />
physical world is what Tegmark calls a mathematical structure -- a
<br />
timeless entity that exists by virtue of its own logical possibility
<br />
-- the only type of thing that truly exists. In his paper he defines a
<br />
mathematical structures perhaps overly generally as &quot;abstract entities
<br />
with relations between them. This would seem to include a great many
<br />
things besides the type of thing we would to call a mathematical
<br />
structure. Personally I think we would want a definition that include
<br />
things like fractals, logical calculi, and the outputs of algorithms
<br />
to name a few examples, while excluding other types of things, such as
<br />
Platonic forms (which would have to be included in the definitions
<br />
provided). However, this ontology them classifies everything that we
<br />
naturally think of as real as just substructures of something that is
<br />
truly real: this universe. We ourselves are merely substrutures,
<br />
albeit the self-aware kind, of this larger, real universe, and we
<br />
therefore derive our being vicariously from it.
<br />
<br />I would like to see that the relationship of the computable universe
<br />
hypothesis to the MUH be clarified. Is our universe's physics
<br />
classically computable at the quantum scale? If not, how does it
<br />
follow that the macroscopic universe, or the universe as a whole is
<br />
classically computable if its operation at the quantum level is not? I
<br />
apologize if this question displays my naivete on the subject, but it
<br />
is something I am currently endeavoring to more clearly understand.
<br />
<br />I am particularly interested in information-theoretic descriptions of
<br />
the this universe, or more precisely, information theory measures of
<br />
the complexity of of this universe's presumed most basic laws (or
<br />
Grand Unified Theory, Max Tegmark's level I TOE). What exactly does it
<br />
mean to assign a value to the complexity of our still-undiscovered
<br />
GUT? Would competing notions of algorithmic complexity yield
<br />
discordant results in this case? Which measure of complexity is to be
<br />
preferred? If we defined the complexity to be the length of the
<br />
shortest possible computer program that could generate the results,
<br />
doesn't this definition imply a particular computational architecture
<br />
that would itself be necessary to account for in measuring algorithmic
<br />
complexity? Also, does having the property of universality imply a
<br />
definite lower-bound to the complexity of a hypothetical physics? once
<br />
again, probably very naive questions on my part, but I would like to
<br />
better understand these matters.
<br />
<br />Probably what I find most appealing about the MUH is how it simplifies
<br />
things. To me it answeres the age-old question, why is there something
<br />
rather than nothing by boldly asserting that the universe is a member
<br />
of the category of being for which there is no difference between
<br />
possibility and necessity.
<br />
<br />However, this formulation leads to speculation on the ontic status of
<br />
paraconsistent systems.
<br />
<br />I look forward to any replies on this extremely interesting topic.
