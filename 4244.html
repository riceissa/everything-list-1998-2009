<br />
I'm in the camp that thinks that emergent systems are real phenomena, and
<br />
that eventually, objective criteria would be able to be established that 
<br />
would
<br />
allow us to say definitively whether an emerged system existed in some
<br />
time and place in the universe.
<br />
<br />I think the criteria would have to do with factors such as:
<br />
<br />1. There is something systematic in evidence
<br />
<br />There is simplicity and regularity of structure and/or behaviour, when some
<br />
view (with some granularity level and some inclusion/exclusion of aspects
<br />
of the phenomenon) is taken of the system.
<br />
<br />Aside: Note that although the taking of the abstracted view of the 
<br />
system is a
<br />
modelling/representation task, the fact that the real system conforms
<br />
to (yields experimental observations consistent with) some simple abstract
<br />
and systematic model is not a model-domain phenomenon; it is a real
<br />
phenomenon. If it were not, we could not expect the real system to behave
<br />
according to the model. If the real system does behave according to the 
<br />
model,
<br />
then clearly it does have some of its real properties which correspond 
<br />
exactly to the
<br />
abstract model properties.
<br />
<br />2.  The systematic aspects of the phenomenon emerged.
<br />
<br />The system emerged from configurations of subsystems or constituent 
<br />
parts, which
<br />
having so configured themselves, give rise to the systematic form or 
<br />
behviour of
<br />
the whole.
<br />
<br />3. The simple, regular, and systematic form or behaviour of the whole, 
<br />
having so emerged,
<br />
is generic and self-defining, in terms of simplicities, regularities 
<br />
etc, and so could,
<br />
theoretically at least,
<br />
have emerged from other constituents, by other means, in other contexts.
<br />
---------------------------------
<br />
<br />Some of the interesting related questions are:
<br />
<br />Why do higher-level systems emerge in our universe? Is there something about
<br />
some systems that allows the system and its constituent parts to out-compete
<br />
alternative configurations of matter and energy?
<br />
<br />For self-reproducing, evolving life systems, the answer seems clearly to be
<br />
yes. But is it really only the genes that are selected for by natural 
<br />
selection,
<br />
or is it also the organism as a whole system, or even whole groups of 
<br />
organisms
<br />
which function well together. The fact that humans have outcompeted other
<br />
animals of our size by 100s and 1000fold population factors on Earth may 
<br />
suggest that
<br />
our complex co-operative systematic group behaviours, themselves, may be 
<br />
both
<br />
a means and a subject of evolutionary success. Maybe it is because 
<br />
humans are
<br />
so well suited to creating emergent systems (technologies, adaptive 
<br />
cultural behaviours)
<br />
at will that we (the constituent parts of those systems) have outcompeted
<br />
our competitors. (Yes, I know we're messing things up royally as we go too,
<br />
but that may come home to roost and is a topic for another day and 
<br />
another forum.)
<br />
<br /><br />Are high-level phenomena such as cultural memes and technological 
<br />
developments
<br />
also systems which are selected for in a competitive evolutionary process?
<br />
<br /><br />But is natural selection also true of any other non-living emerged systems?
<br />
<br />In some cases, the basic forces and properties of matter seem to produce
<br />
emergent systems (galaxies, solar systems) which don't so much &quot;out-compete&quot;
<br />
alternative configurations of matter and energy, but are &quot;the only possible&quot;
<br />
configurations of matter and energy, given the rules. Nevertheless, it 
<br />
is still
<br />
somewhat interesting that they form systems which have obvious simplicities
<br />
about their form and behaviour at macro levels. Why should that be so? Any
<br />
reason?
<br />
<br />Just a random collection of thoughts on the topic.
<br />
---------------
<br />
<br />In summary:
<br />
<br />- Properties of being systematic, simple, regular are absolute, logical 
<br />
properties,
<br />
just as the property of being one thing versus being two things is an 
<br />
absolute logical
<br />
&nbsp;property. However, just because these are logical properties does not 
<br />
mean that the
<br />
things which manifest those properties (have isomorphic correspondences 
<br />
to those
<br />
properties, assuming some consistent, regular individuating rules and 
<br />
representation rules)
<br />
are not real.
<br />
<br />- Emergence of high-level systems is real (and may then
<br />
be modelled and experimentally verified).
<br />
<br />- Emergent systems may have evolutionary advantages
<br />
over non-systematic configurations of matter and energy,
<br />
which may be one explanation for their prevalence.
