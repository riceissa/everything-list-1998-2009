</em><br />
No.  Unless it was Disulfiram elixer. . .(sorry, couldn't resist.)
<br />
<br />But were the antipsychotic meds *causing* the dreams or was it due to an 
<br />
insufficiently low dose?  In the early 1970s ketamine Hcl was the 
<br />
anesthetic of choice on kids for minor surgical procedures---it was good 
<br />
for 25 minutes, it preserved the laryngeal reflex--and you could always 
<br />
tell when they were coming out---they would elicit this gripping 
<br />
motion.  But in some cases it gave the kids OBEs.   Typical doc response: 
<br />
Yipes!  Let's use something else!
<br />
Now, they use ketamine ONLY on Rover and Fluffy.  Gives 'em big pupils for 
<br />
a couple of hours, and you don't really *care* what sensitive places they 
<br />
visited while they were under.
<br />
<br />As for precognition. . while doing research for a book I authored in the 
<br />
mid-eighties, I first tracked nuclear clouds across the US--then went to 
<br />
the libraries in the paths of the debris clouds to see what was taking 
<br />
place as the radioactive material passed overhead.  There were some strange 
<br />
coincidences, but that's probably all they were.  However, there was one 
<br />
thing that impressed me---those in the &quot;creative&quot; professions occasionally 
<br />
conjure up artwork that, in retrospect, appears to be a precognitive 
<br />
&quot;shadow&quot; of an event taking place days or weeks later.  The day before the 
<br />
worlds' first nuclear test, the NY Times had a couple of sly articles in 
<br />
the editorial section that alluded to the nuke,test.  One article, for 
<br />
example, was titled, &quot;A Gadget Long Needed.&quot;  There was a book review about 
<br />
three stories:  Two were titled, &quot;A Fiery Lake&quot; and &quot;Solano.&quot; Now, of 
<br />
course, the NYT also had a reporter present at Los Alamos, so they probably 
<br />
wanted to scoop everyone else.   Precognition score:  probably zero.   But 
<br />
then there was the weird little cartoon called &quot;Flyin' Jenny&quot; which was 
<br />
found in the secondary papers---in places like Mason City, Iowa and 
<br />
Houston, TX.  on July 15, 1945 the main character (Flyin' Jenny)  picked up 
<br />
her microphone and said: &quot;Is there fire at the end of that gadget?&quot;   To 
<br />
me, that's pushing the coincidence envelope.
