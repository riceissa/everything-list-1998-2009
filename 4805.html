<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     My problem is that COMP requires the existence of an infinite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; computational system that is immune from the laws of thermodynamics.
</em><br />
That
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; makes it HIGHLY suspect in my book.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [HF]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; First, I'm not sure that Bruno's COMP hypothesis (which is basically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that minds can't tell what is computing them) does require this, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; arguably the hypothesis that our entire universe is a computer program,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and that all such programs and all such universes exist, requires some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; such assumption.  But is this any more problematic than the conventional
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; view that there exists an infinitely reliable set of mathematical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; equations that specify the &quot;laws of nature&quot;?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it that there is a requirement of an &quot;infinitely reliable set of
<br />
mathematics&quot; or, as I would put it, an infallible representation, or is it
<br />
like I have asked previously: What if we consider that the &quot;best possible&quot;
<br />
simulation of some object
<br />
is indistinguishable from a &quot;actual object&quot;?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has often been stated that there is more that one curve that connects
<br />
together the same set of points in the same order. We also have reasons to
<br />
appeal to Occam's razor to help us find the &quot;best theory&quot;. But are we sure
<br />
that our &quot;specifications&quot; of the &quot;laws of physics&quot; are something that is
<br />
unproblematic? I often wonder if we are just communicating within the
<br />
commonalities of our individual existences and not some &quot;pre-specifiable
<br />
laws of physics&quot;!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you read J. Wheeler's essay &quot;Law without law&quot;?
<br />
<br />&nbsp;Wheeler, J. A. (1983), &quot;Law Without Law.&quot; In Quantum Theory and
<br />
Measurement, ed. J. Wheeler and W. Zurek. Princeton, N. J.: Princeton Univ.
<br />
Press.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; [SPK]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Even if we make the &quot;leap of faith&quot; and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; assume that all that exists is numbers and the relations among them, how
</em><br />
do
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; we explain the reason that the &quot;illusion&quot; of a &quot;flow of time&quot; occurs?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [HF]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a good question, and I would suggest two answers.  The first is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that when we apply the anthropic principle and look for universes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain observers, we are implicitly assuming that observers require a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; flow of time.  It is almost impossible to conceive of an observer that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be timeless, and if such a thing existed, we would not recognize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it as an observer.  But if we do accept that in some sense timeless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; observers could exist, then no doubt they do exist, in universes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; may not have anything like a flow of time.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, but you are explicitly only considering entities like you and I as
<br />
prototypical. This reminds me of the way that people tend to define life and
<br />
involves things like DNA and carbon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is that this line of thought seems to allow a kind of
<br />
teleological thinking that has no place in philosophy of science. While it
<br />
is a probability of 1 that an observer will find itself in a universe that
<br />
is consistent with the existence of that observer, this tells us nothing at
<br />
all whether or not such an observer is a priori possible. The latter
<br />
requires us to postulate such things as Plenitudes, Platonias and Kripkean
<br />
and Leibnizian analogs of possible worlds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem that I see is that these collections of &quot;all possible&quot; do
<br />
not include some necessity of the experience of &quot;time&quot; and its included
<br />
distingtions between &quot;past&quot; and &quot;future&quot;. We can recall the debate that
<br />
Boltzman had with his critics regarding the &quot;H-theorem&quot; as an illustration.
<br />
It is one thing to see the necessity of all possibilities, it is something
<br />
else entirely to necesitate my own experience of a flow of time. Something
<br />
is &quot;happening&quot; and it isn't &quot;just a static set of relations&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;[HF]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The second answer is that it may be that the simplest set of laws
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that allows for observers like ourselves to exist inherently requires
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; something like time to exist as well.  We are complex, and we know that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in our universe, we were the result of the process of evolution starting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with simple chemistry and building up complex biology.  To get our level
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of complexity you either need a complex universe, which implies a large
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and improbable program, or you need a simple universe with a flow of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time sufficient to let something like evolution operate.  Therefore it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is more likely that systems complex enough to be called observers will
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exist in universes where there is causality, consistency and evolution.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<br />[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I can go along with. I only ask for some reasoning as to how it is
<br />
that we have an &quot;arrow of time&quot;. My suggestion is that we consider that
<br />
there is &quot;process&quot; both implicit in and necessary for computation.  ;-)
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
<br />Stephen
