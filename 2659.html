<br />We will appreciate this later.

UDA entails ``necessary (COMP entails SE proper)&quot;,

that. Now, it happens I isolate with my UTM interviews  a

non trivial part of the derivation, perhaps. You will judge.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't understand, but if you actually found a way to derive the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have achieved such a feat.
</em><br />
<br />OK, same answer. I will show you the proof. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Right, I think we are now in agreement! The key words are CONSISTENT 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extensions.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This means that a consciousness can be fuzzy... and the world it lives 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in... or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rather each world (in the whole set of worlds it lives in) must be a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;CONSISTENT
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;extension of this consciousness. The degree of the consciousness fuzziness
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;corresponds to the size of the set of worlds. The word &quot;consistent&quot; implies
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;logical consistency where logic is in relation to the consciousness of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;observer.
</em><br />
<br />Yes.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; [BM] Turing-tropic instead. That the simple shift I do. There is a nice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; mathematical way to interview the self introspecting honest machine.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; (BTW and by Solovay there are *two* nice utterly non trivial ways).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't understand Turing-tropic
</em><br />
<br />Mhh... the fact is that we can interview Sound Universal Turing
<br />
Machines about themselves and about their consistent extensions.
<br />
It is not easy. Godel's theorem and Lob's theorem is just a beginning
<br />
of that interview. Then Solovay find axiomatic systems ...
<br />
I will explain.  
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;No they don't share life stories. They share *memories* of life stories. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Memories,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;true or false are PRESENT properties of their mind. This is why I rather 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;assume a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;first order Markov process, which does not depends on past information.
</em><br />
<br /><br />At the substitution level we can certainly be described by such a first
<br />
order Markov process. 
<br />
<br />But with comp we cannot know for sure the substitution level (this
<br />
is Benaceraff's insight: if we are consistent machine we cannot know
<br />
consistently which one we are; this is of course linked to the godelian
<br />
&quot;fuzziness&quot; of the set of our consistent extensions.
<br />
<br />But perhaps there is something more I should ask you before. You said
<br />
in response to some post of me, in some preceeding dialog:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&lt;I smell a whiff of third person thinking.&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Well, I know you are not stuck in third person (like Schmidhuber and 
<br />
Mallah) but I hope you are not exclusively first-person.
<br />
<br />It is useful to identify 3-person honest communication with 
<br />
belief (proof). let us write []A for: the sound machine 
<br />
can prove (believe) A.
<br />
<br />It is natural to have
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[](A-&gt;B) -&gt; ([]A -&gt;[]B)
<br />
<br />meaning that if it is provable that (A-&gt;B) then, if it is provable
<br />
that A then it is provable that B.
<br />
<br />It is useful to identify the first person with the knower, and, if I
<br />
write [.]A for I can know A, it is natural to have also:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[.](A-&gt;B) -&gt; ([.]A -&gt;[.]B)
<br />
<br />Both []A -&gt; [][]A  and  [.]A -&gt; [.][.]A are quite natural once we
<br />
treat sufficiently introspective machine or entities.
<br />
For them: A is believable entails that it is believable
<br />
that A is believable, and the same for knowable.
<br />
<br />It is natural to have that the knowability entails the believability:
<br />
That is: [.]A -&gt; []A.  Do you agree ? It just mean that if A is knowable
<br />
then A is believable.
<br />
<br />OK ?
<br />
<br />With the intuitive meaning of belief and knowledge the reverse
<br />
is certainly wrong: the fact that A is believable does not entails
<br />
that A is knowable. We don't have []A -&gt; [.]A. For exemple it is
<br />
believable that the earth is flat, but that is hardly knowable.
<br />
<br />In fact it seems that for knowledge we have [.]A -&gt; A,
<br />
but for belief we don't have []A -&gt; A.
<br />
<br />Would you basicaly agree until here ...
<br />
<br />It looks like I propose you some analytical philosophy.
<br />
Later I will propose you *arithmetical* philosophy. The meaning
<br />
of [] and [.] and others toward observability will be defined
<br />
in arithmetic and only then will the UDA be translated in
<br />
that arithmetical philosophy and then the necessarily hilbertian 
<br />
structure on the consistent extensions will begin to appear.
<br />
<br />Do you know some elementary classical logics?
<br />
The magic which will put an unexpected and rather involved
<br />
fuzzy structure on the set of consistent extensions comes
<br />
from godel's theorem (with [] modelize by formal provability).
<br />
It looks like an oversimplification, but even with that
<br />
oversimplification we will get non trivial theories of belief,
<br />
knowledge, observation, etc.
<br />
<br />Do you know Aristote Modal Square: (read []p &quot;necessarily p&quot;)
<br />
&quot;-&quot; is not.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[]p    []-p
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-[]p   -[]-p
<br />
<br /><br />or its dual (read &lt;&gt;p possibly p):
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&lt;&gt;-p    -&lt;&gt;p
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;-p     &lt;&gt;p
<br />
<br /><br />They match. I mean []p is equivalent to -&lt;&gt;-p. ``It is necessary
<br />
that p&quot; is equivalent with ``it is not possible that -p&quot;, and
<br />
``it is possible that p&quot; is equivalent with &quot;it is not necessary
<br />
that -p&quot;. And then []-p is equivalent with -&lt;&gt;p, and &lt;&gt;-p is 
<br />
equivalent with -[]p.
<br />
<br />Later []p will mean p is formally provable, then &lt;&gt;p is read as
<br />
consistent.
<br />
To say p is consistent is indeed equivalent with saying that -p
<br />
is not provable.
<br />
Consistency, that is the non provability of FALSE, is then
<br />
equivalent with the consistency of TRUE, and Godel's theorem
<br />
can be written:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&gt;TRUE -&gt; -[]&lt;&gt;TRUE.
<br />
<br />TRUE and FALSE are just two propositional constant. You can
<br />
identify TRUE with the proposition (1 = 1) and FALSE with the
<br />
proposition (1 = 0).
<br />
We are just at the beginning. In a next post I will explain
<br />
Leibnitz semantics. It is fun. And it will help us for
<br />
introducing Kripke semantics, which is just a &quot;relativisation&quot;
<br />
of Leibnitz semantics. That will even, perhaps, help us
<br />
to understand the difference between the absolutist and the
<br />
relativist in our discussions.
