<br />
Yes, in your thesis you often talk about survival under replacement of
<br />
a digital brain (cerveau digital). Digital simply means &quot;operates with
<br />
1s and 0s&quot;. Since any analogue value can be represented arbitrarily
<br />
accurately by a digital signal, this doesn't seem much of a stretch.
<br />
<br />In your chapter 1, you refer to a &quot;machine universelle digitale, c'est
<br />
a dire un ordinateur&quot;. The English word computer, which is the literal
<br />
translation of ordinateur, can refer to an analogue computer, which is
<br />
merely a device for performing computations - it needn't even be
<br />
Turing complete. The fact that you used the word &quot;universelle&quot;
<br />
previous does imply Turing completeness, but not that it is equivalent
<br />
to a Turing machine. After all, I might be concerned if there was some
<br />
noncomputable part of the brain that was not captured by a Turing
<br />
machine, but could be built into a digital machine of some kind (eg by
<br />
accurate copying of the physical layout of the brain).
<br />
<br />***
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the key here is something like a 1st person version of a
<br />
Turing Test: If you can not tell a difference between one's world of
<br />
experience while in a &quot;meat machine&quot; - brain - and a digital machine then it
<br />
is not a difference. Substantivalists will try to dispute this but that is a
<br />
debate for another day.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would seem to require only that there sufficient expressiveness
<br />
within the digital machine's n-ary representation to encode all of the
<br />
fullness of all 1st person experiences that whatever kind of &quot;machine&quot; -
<br />
meat or silicon or whatever - could have.
<br />
<br />***
<br />
[RS]
<br />
Now I noticed you used the word &quot;indexical&quot;. What does this mean? (I
<br />
tend to skip over terms I don't understand, in the hope that I
<br />
understand the gist of the argument).
<br />
<br />Anyway, the upshot of this was that I assumed that COMP was in fact
<br />
more general that computationalism. In fact I believe the first half
<br />
of your thesis (chapters 1-4) indeed still hold for this more general
<br />
interpretation of COMP (namely the necessity for subjective
<br />
indeterminism etc). True computationalism is perhaps only required for
<br />
the later sections where you invoke Thaetus's (is that the correct
<br />
translation of Theetete?) theories  of knowledge (connaissance). For
<br />
here, you need Goedel's theorem, which is applicable in the case of
<br />
Turing machines.
<br />
<br />***
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that COMP is more general that computationalism since it
<br />
seems to include certain unfalsifiable postulations that are independent of
<br />
computationalism per say, AR, to be specific. My own difficulties with
<br />
Bruno's thesis hinges on this postulation. I see it as an avoidance of a
<br />
fundamental difficulty in Foundation research, how to account for the 1st
<br />
person experience of time if one assumes that Existence in itself is
<br />
Time-less.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Computationnalism is really the &quot;modern&quot; digital version of &quot;Mechanism&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; a philosophy guessed by early Hindouist, Plato, ... accepted for
</em><br />
animals
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; Descartes, for humans by La Mettrie, Hobbes, etc. With Church
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt; thesis mechanism can  leads to pretty mind/matter theories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[RS]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If one accepts mechanisms that go beyond the Turing machine, then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;computationalism is a stricter assumption than mere mechanism (which I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;basically interpret as &quot;anti-vitalism&quot;).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I would counter that a Geiger counter hooked up to a radioactive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;source is a &quot;mechanism&quot;, yet the output cannot be computed by a Turing

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;machine. (Of course some people, such as Schmidhuber would disagree

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;with that too, but that's another story).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [BM]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But no mechanism can compute the output of any self-duplication.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; With Everett formulation of QM, a Geiger counter is emulable by a turing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; machine, and the QM indeterminacy is just a first person comp

indeterminacy.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You cannot emulate with a turing machine the *first person* knowledge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he/she gets from looking at the Geiger counts, but no machine can

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; either.

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is somewhere else that I trip over and fall in my thinking of your
<br />
work, Bruno. Is this &quot;mechanism can compute the output of any
<br />
self-duplication&quot; a classical version of the &quot;no-cloning&quot; theorem?
<br />
<br /><br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bruno

<br />[RS]
<br />
I agree one can simulate the Schroedinger equation of QM (albeit with
<br />
irrelevant exponential slowdown). However, mapping this back to your
<br />
&quot;YD&quot; postulate, this involves the doctor swapping the entire universe,
<br />
not just your brain. Perhaps you mean that one of the options the
<br />
doctor has is to upload you into a well crafted digital simulation (by
<br />
a Turing machine even) of you and your complete environment (a la
<br />
Matrix).
<br />
<br />***
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my comment above about how to bridge this gap of emulating a brain
<br />
and emulating the entire universe? If it does it would seem to dramatically
<br />
increase the computational power requirements of the emulating computation
<br />
on top of the exponential slowdown.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One technical question I have about this is: if we assume that the
<br />
emulated universe is finite, what would be the equation showing the required
<br />
computational power of the emulator given an estimate of the total
<br />
algorithmic and/or information content of the universe?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, what are we to make of results such as the Kochen-Specker
<br />
theorem that show that given any quantum mechanical system that has more
<br />
than two independent degrees of freedom can not be completely represented in
<br />
terms of  Boolean algebra?
<br />
<br />***
<br />
[RS]
<br />
Reminds me of the option Arthur Dent was presented with by the
<br />
pandimensional beings (aka mice) when they wanted to mince his brain
<br />
to extract the question for which the answer was '42'.
<br />
<br />***
<br />
[SPK]
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions like &quot;What is we are &quot;really&quot; pandimensional beings that are
<br />
only consciously aware of what they are like as &quot;humans?&quot; suddenly have more
<br />
than a literary meaning. ;-P
<br />
<br />Kindest regards,
<br />
