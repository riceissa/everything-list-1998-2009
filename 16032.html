_____________________________________
<br />
<br />Perhaps it's time I had another go at explaining all that weird stuff I
<br />
believe in and why.
<br />
<br />Well, for those few that don't know, I reckon that all possible universes
<br />
exist and that everyone's immortal.
<br />
<br />I admit, this does sound rather odd. It would have sounded odd to me about
<br />
10 years ago, too. Since about the age of 8 I was a pretty hardcore rational
<br />
scientific naturalist: everything is simply matter and energy, and we but
<br />
its dreams. What was *real*? Well, a chair. An atom. Something you can *
<br />
touch*. After all, when you think of reality, you think of something...
<br />
there. Something that sits there, quietly existing to itself.
<br />
<br />But what does that mean, really? Everyone knows that matter is almost
<br />
entirely empty space, anyway - the solidity is just the feather-touch of
<br />
far-extended electromagnetic fields. Electrons popping in and out of
<br />
existence as the energy fields knot so charge can be transferred in
<br />
quantised lumps. Particles do not behave as billiard balls - they are
<br />
ghosts, obeying strange equations, lacking hard and fast surfaces or
<br />
reliable locations. Matter, energy, space, time... they all begin to seem a
<br />
bit ethereal when you look at them.
<br />
<br />Time. There's another one. I don't really believe in that, either. Spacetime
<br />
is just a barely distinguishable fabric woven by the universe. Events do not
<br />
occur at a time or a place - most of the observables we see arise
<br />
kaleidoscope like out of an intricate web of possibilities, their form
<br />
imposed by our own consciousness. And by that, I mean that our minds are
<br />
embedded within the universe, constructed in such a way that the
<br />
metaphysical structure of the cosmos is implied by our design - the word
<br />
without reflects the world within. This has an aspect of the anthropic
<br />
principle to it - that we observe a world capable of supporting our
<br />
existence because if it didn't, we wouldn't.
<br />
<br />But this still has no bearing on how I started thinking things like this, so
<br />
I shall get that out of the way.
<br />
<br />The short story is that I read some stories by a science-fiction author
<br />
called Greg Egan. Before you laugh too much, a lot of sci-fi is essentially
<br />
just window-dressing to convey an idea - the implications of some item of
<br />
technology, turn of events or scientific/philosophical argument. And Greg
<br />
Egan is a 'hard' science-fiction author, an ideas merchant. Well, you get
<br />
the drift.
<br />
<br />The first story I read was called Wang's Carpets (later included as a
<br />
chapter of the book Diaspora), in which some spacefarers (themselves
<br />
software) find a planet whose major life-form are floating mats that take
<br />
the form of Wang Tiles - tesselating objects whose patterns can implement a
<br />
universal turing machine. But that's just the set-up for the *idea*: when
<br />
someone analyses the Carpets, by taking various abstract variables
<br />
(appearance of certain tiles and features, etc) and putting them through
<br />
frequency transforms, it turns out that the computations the Carpets encode
<br />
as part of their reproductive habits give rise to a fully realised
<br />
n-dimensional space containing self-aware creatures.
<br />
<br />The thought-provoking part here was not that consciousness could be
<br />
digitalised and run as software - I had already pretty much accepted that -
<br />
but that the mathematical transformations necessary to do this could be
<br />
pretty strange, and come from processes that were essentially plucked
<br />
arbitrarily from the environment. That,  largely, consciousness could be a
<br />
matter of perspective.
<br />
<br />The second story was the book, Permutation City. A great deal of this book
<br />
concerns one of the protagonists who wakes up one day and finds he is simply
<br />
a downloaded copy - and that the 'real' him is running experiments. After
<br />
being run at different speeds, and distributed in space and time, backwards,
<br />
in chunks of different sizes, etc., the argument becomes that it doesn't
<br />
matter what or how the program is run - it is all the same from the
<br />
perspective of the consciousness being implemented, and that this is so
<br />
abstract that one can find the relevant computational processes within
<br />
*any*physical substrate. That
<br />
*all* consciousnesses can be found within a grain of sand. That there is not
<br />
even any physical bedrock to fall back upon - there is no way ever to
<br />
verify, even in principle, that one is on the 'fundamental' metapysical
<br />
level. At the end of the book, the characters have escaped into their own
<br />
computational world, completely divorced from any physical hardware. Their
<br />
universe contains a simulation of another world, whose very alien
<br />
inhabitants find their own physical principles for the cosmos they observe -
<br />
principles radically different from the computational ones 'running' it, and
<br />
so compelling they start to take over the character's world, too.
<br />
<br />So when you get down to it, I no longer believe in the physical world - or
<br />
rather, I believe in all of them. While I used to require reasons to believe
<br />
in the existence of parallel worlds, I now require them not to. Existence,
<br />
after all, can have no overseers. No arbiters to conjure it from nowhere.
<br />
Time, remember, is just something created from within our cosmos - on a more
<br />
fundamental level, nothing changes, nothing is created or destroyed. Things
<br />
simply are, or are not. Either they satisfy the criteria for existing, or
<br />
not. Either they are possible, and exist, or they are impossible, and do
<br />
not.
<br />
<br />Assuming just our world exists is like, to me, saying just the number 532
<br />
exists, and that there is no proof for any other number.
<br />
<br />The Many Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics is like a very diluted
<br />
version of this. All it says is that the equations of QM and our
<br />
observations are consistent with the idea that, rather than the myriad
<br />
possibilities inherent in a quantum system mysteriously collapsing into one
<br />
observed outcome, all outcomes are realised. At first, this seems a little
<br />
too much to believe. Where do they come from? Well, the key word there was
<br />
mysterious. Nowhere in the equations of QM is the collapse predicted. That's
<br />
our own kludge, inserted to explain the fact that we somehow only see
<br />
single, classical, outcomes. QM predicts that all these outcomes exist
<br />
anyway, interacting within the wavefunction. The MWI simply asks: what if
<br />
they don't stop existing? What if the act of observation simply causes our
<br />
own wavefunction to split along those pre-existing lines? If those decohered
<br />
elements don't interact much, we would get precisely what we do see anyway.
<br />
<br />Now, if I exist in multiple worlds, how many me's are there? I would say:
<br />
only 1. My consciousness, such that I observe it, is unique. While it might
<br />
appear in an infinite number of possibile realities, it is a constant, a
<br />
fulcrum. I carry along with me a train of all possible universes. So I don't
<br />
think of myself as existing in 'this world', not really. I am in all of
<br />
them.
<br />
<br />Now: immortality. Or 'quantum immortality', as the idea is known. I am
<br />
running out of time, so I shall just say this: amongst all these universes I
<br />
inhabit, there are possible future trajectories that take me into universes
<br />
in which I am dead. However, I shall not be around to observe this; I can
<br />
only witness universes in which I am alive. And there will always be
<br />
possible trajectories into sets of universes in which I *am* alive. And that
<br />
is what I will witness: I cannot die. Not in my world, anyway.
<br />
<br />Anyway, gotta dash now.

<br />
- Mmm.
<br />
- That was me... and six other guys.
