<br />
IMO belief in the ASSA is tantamount to altruism.  The ASSA would imply
<br />
taking action based on its positive impact on the whole multiverse of
<br />
observer-moments (OMs).
<br />
<br />We have had some discussion here and on the extropy-chat (transhumanist)
<br />
mailing list about two different possible flavors of altruism.  These are
<br />
sometimes called averagist vs totalist.
<br />
<br />The averagist wants to maximize the average happiness of humanity.
<br />
He opposes measures that will add more people at the expense of decreasing
<br />
their average happiness.  This is a pretty common element among &quot;green&quot;
<br />
political movements.
<br />
<br />The totalist wants to maximize the total happiness of humanity.
<br />
He believes that people are good and more people are better.  This
<br />
philosophy is less common but is sometimes associated with libertarian
<br />
or radical right wing politics.
<br />
<br />These two ideas can be applied to observer-moments as well.  But both
<br />
of these approaches have problems if taken to the extreme.
<br />
<br />For the extreme averagist, half the OMs are below average.  If they were
<br />
eliminated, the average would rise.  But again, half of the remaining
<br />
OMs would be below (the new, higher) average.  So again half should be
<br />
eliminated.  In the end you are left with the one OM with the highest
<br />
average happiness.  Eliminating almost every ounce of intelligence in
<br />
the universe hardly seems altruistic.
<br />
<br />For the extreme totalist, the problem is that he will support adding
<br />
OMs as long as their quality of life is just barely above that which
<br />
would lead to suicide.  More OMs generally will decrease the quality
<br />
of life of others, due to competition for resources, so the result is
<br />
a massively overpopulated universe with everyone leading terrible lives.
<br />
This again seems inconsistent with the goals of altruism.
<br />
<br />In practice it seems that some middle ground must be found.  Adding
<br />
more OMs is good, up to a point.  I don't know if anyone has a good,
<br />
objective measure that can be maximized for an effective approach to
<br />
altruism.
<br />
<br />Let us consider these flavors of altruism in the case of Stathis' puzzle:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You are one of 10 copies who are being tortured. The copies are all being 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run in lockstep with each other, as would occur if 10 identical computers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; were running 10 identical sentient programs. Assume that the torture is so 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bad that death is preferable, and so bad that escaping it with your life is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only marginally preferable to escaping it by dying (eg., given the option of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a 50% chance of dying or a 49% chance of escaping the torture and living, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you would take the 50%). The torture will continue for a year, but you are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allowed one of 3 choices as to how things will proceed:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a) 9 of the 10 copies will be chosen at random and painlessly killed, while 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the remaining copy will continue to be tortured.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (b) For one minute, the torture will cease and the number of copies will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; increase to 10^100. Once the minute is up, the number of copies will be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reduced to 10 again and the torture will resume as before.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (c) the torture will be stopped for 8 randomly chosen copies, and continue 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the other 2.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which would you choose?
</em><br />
<br />For the averagist, doing (a) will not change average happiness.  Doing
<br />
(b) will improve it, but not that much.  The echoes of the torture and
<br />
anticipation of future torture will make that one minute of respite
<br />
not particularly pleasant.  Doing (c) would seem to be the best choice,
<br />
as 8 out of the 10 avoid a year of torture.  (I'm not sure why Stathis
<br />
seemed to say that the people would not want to escape their torture,
<br />
given that it was so bad.  That doesn't seem right to me; the worse it
<br />
is, the more they would want to escape it.)
<br />
<br />For the totalist, since death is preferable to the torture, each
<br />
person's life has a negative impact on total happiness.  Hence (a)
<br />
would be an improvement as it removes these negatives from the universe.
<br />
Doing (b) is unclear: during that one minute, would the 10^100 copies
<br />
kill themselves if possible?  If so, their existence is negative and
<br />
so doing (b) would make the universe much worse due to the addition
<br />
of so many negatively happy OMs.  Doing (c) would seem to be better,
<br />
assuming that the 8 out of 10 would eventually find that their lives
<br />
were positive during that year without torture.
<br />
<br />So it appears that each one would choose (c), although they would differ
<br />
about whether (a) is an improvement over the status quo.
<br />
<br />(b) is deprecated because that one minute will not be pleasant due to
<br />
the echoes of the torture.  If the person could have his memory wiped
<br />
for that one minute and neither remember nor anticipate future torture,
<br />
that would make (b) the best choice for both kinds of altruists.  Adding
<br />
10^100 pleasant observer-moments would increase both total and average
<br />
happiness and would more than compensate for a year of suffering for 10
<br />
people.  10^100 is a really enormous number.
