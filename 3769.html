</em><br />
<br />I am only 1/4 way through the book, but at this point he seems to mostly
<br />
be basing his criteria on how the output looks.  I understand from book
<br />
reviews that at some point he will bring in the notion of computational
<br />
systems that have the power of universal computers, and show that some
<br />
simple systems are able to do this.  These are all inherently of class 4
<br />
(structured), I believe.
<br />
<br />The first 6 (of 12) chapters, which are as far as I have read, are
<br />
essentially an observationally-oriented discussion of the behavior of
<br />
simple computing systems.  Wolfram reminds me of an 18th century scientist
<br />
exploring a new part of the natural world, say an early microscopist
<br />
or astronomer.  He is just trying to get the basic classifications into
<br />
place, observing similarities among different systems.  But instead of
<br />
studying plants and animals, he is studying computational systems.
<br />
<br />In our terms, this portion of the book can be thought of as a naturalist's
<br />
beginning explorations of the multiverse, the collection of all universes
<br />
produced by computer programs.  His main result so far seems to be that
<br />
it doesn't matter what is the basis for your computational engine: CAs,
<br />
Turing machines, numeric recurrence relations, partial differential
<br />
equations; all produce the same basic classes of patterns.  He examines
<br />
10-20 different ways of implementing simple computational systems and
<br />
shows that they all look much the same.  The main difference is that
<br />
some produce structure in as many as ~10% of programs, while for others
<br />
it is only perhaps one in a million.
<br />
<br />I see some connections between Wolfram's explorations and Greg Chaitin's
<br />
(creator of Algorithmic Information Theory) results.  For years, Chaitin
<br />
has emphasized the need to approach mathematics as an experimental
<br />
science, but no one has taken him very seriously.  Wolfram's work suggests
<br />
to me an approach to putting this program into action.  For example,
<br />
here is a quote from Chaitin I ran into last night, from a recent essay,
<br />
<a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/amsci.html">http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/amsci.html</a>:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A case in point is elementary number theory, where there are some very
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;difficult questions. Consider the prime numbers. Individual prime
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;numbers behave in a very unpredictable way, if you're interested
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their detailed structure. It's true that there are statistical
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patterns. There's a thing called the prime number theorem that predicts
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fairly accurately the overall average distribution of the primes. But
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as for the detailed distribution of individual prime numbers, that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;looks pretty random.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I began to think that maybe the inherent randomness in mathematics
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provided a deeper reason for all this incompleteness.
<br />
<br />Wolfram has a chapter on patterns in the integers, and several of his
<br />
examples of randomness are based on the distribution of primes.  Is the
<br />
randomness of this distribution caused by the same effects which Wolfram
<br />
has identified, which make so many simple computational systems produce
<br />
similarly random distributions?  If we understand that randomness is a
<br />
frequent consequence of simple systems, then it is not surprising that
<br />
primes are random in the details of their distribution.
<br />
<br />Another connection between Chaitin and Wolfram has to do with the
<br />
underpinnings of the multiverse.  From Chaitin and AIT we know that any
<br />
universal computer can emulate any other using a fixed size program.
<br />
This means that universes agree on their relative measures to within a
<br />
constant factor (whose value depends on which system is emulating which
<br />
other system).  Therefore, in the limit of large programs, where this
<br />
constant factor becomes insignificant, universes have the same relative
<br />
measures independent of what the details are of the computational
<br />
substrate which runs the multiverse.  (I interpret this to mean that we
<br />
can never find out what kind of computer it is that the multiverse is
<br />
based on, or equivalently, that it doesn't matter.)
<br />
<br />This seems to somewhat contradict Wolfram's experiments, which show that
<br />
different computational systems have rather different (a few orders of
<br />
magnitude) probabilities of showing complex behavior.  Presumably the
<br />
reason is that Wolfram is only dealing with simple programs.  If it were
<br />
possible to extend his results to larger programs, we might predict
<br />
based on AIT that all computational systems would converge to equal
<br />
probabilities for the different classes of behavior.
<br />
<br />I understand that Wolfram introduces some ideas about computational
<br />
equivalence in the last chapter of the book, but I don't think he goes
<br />
in exactly this direction.
