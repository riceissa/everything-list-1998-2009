Just to clarify my view on copies, if they start to diverge from me the 
<br />
moment they are created, then they aren't me and I don't care about them in 
<br />
a *selfish* way. That is, if a copy experiences a pain, I don't experience 
<br />
that pain, which I think is as good a test as any to distinguish self from 
<br />
other. This doesn't mean I should be indifferent to the copy's suffering 
<br />
just because he is a copy; I should treat him just like anyone else. What my 
<br />
actual attitude to the copy would be I'm not really sure, having never been 
<br />
in such a situation. I might be resentful and uncomfortable around him, or I 
<br />
may be over-solicitous. But whatever my feelings are, there is a good chance 
<br />
they will be reciprocated.
<br />
<br />Your scenario with the person being shot when he has just walked out of a 
<br />
duplicating booth reminds me of a number of SF novels where people &quot;back up&quot; 
<br />
their minds on a regular basis, in case they get killed in an accident. This 
<br />
may help the dead person's family, but it always seemed to me rather 
<br />
pointless from a selfish point of view, since I would still be losing the 
<br />
memories since the backup, and I would therefore still be afraid of dying. 
<br />
If the backup were done continually, within milliseconds of any thought or 
<br />
experience, that would be a different matter.
<br />
<br />Which brings us to death. My definition of death is that it occurs at a 
<br />
particular time point in an observer's life when there is no successor 
<br />
observer moment ever, anywhere. So with the backup example above, if you 
<br />
suffered a fatal accident today and had the instantant backup machinery 
<br />
going, everything up to the moment you lost consciousness would have been 
<br />
recorded, so your mind can be emulated using the data, and you wake up as an 
<br />
upload (or robot , or newly grown human clone) just as you would wake up in 
<br />
hospital if the accident had rendered you unconscious rather than killed 
<br />
you. Whereas if you had only the el cheapo once a day backup, the last thing 
<br />
you see before you are killed is the last thing you will ever see.
<br />
<br />With my example, it is important to remeber that the 10^100 copies are 
<br />
*exact* copies which stay in lockstep for the full 10 minutes. If they were 
<br />
initially exact copies and then allowed to diverge, terminating them after 
<br />
10 minutes would be an act of mass murder, because once they are terminated, 
<br />
their memories and personalities are gone forever: there is no successor OM. 
<br />
(Whether you can call it murder, which is bad, when God does it is an 
<br />
interesting aside, since by definition God never does anything bad.) 
<br />
However, with the exact copies as described, there definitely *is* a 
<br />
successor OM, provided by the single copy in the room when the 10 minutes is 
<br />
up. The continuity is even better than with the &quot;instant&quot; backup machine 
<br />
described above, since nothing special needs to be done other than allow one 
<br />
of the 10^100 to continue living. So in this case, terminating the 10^100 
<br />
copies is not murder at all, because subjectively, all the copies' stream of 
<br />
consciousness would continue seamlessly.
<br />
<br />Finally, there is the idea that a conscious entity's measure has some effect 
<br />
on the entity. If you have given an explanation of why you think this is so, 
<br />
I have missed it or (more likely) not recognised it. Do you think there is 
<br />
any empirical test that can be done to demonstrate higher or lower measure? 
<br />
Do you accept the way I have presented the thought experiment above, i.e. 
<br />
that when God creates or destroys 10^100 copies the subject notices 
<br />
absolutely nothing other than the light changing colour, or do you think he 
<br />
would notice some other difference? If so, it would have to be an *enormous* 
<br />
difference, given the numbers we are talking about; what difference would it 
<br />
make if the ratio were, say, 2:1 instead? Can you honestly say that this 
<br />
subjective effect of measure isn't something that will be cut down by 
<br />
Occam's Razor as a needless complication?
<br />
<br />Sorry if the last paragraph sounds like I'm being provocative, but this one 
<br />
topic seems to be the source of most of the disagreement between us.

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You find yourself in a locked room with no windows, and no memory of how 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; got there. The room is sparsely furnished: a chair, a desk, pen and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paper,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and in one corner a light. The light is currently red, but in the time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have been in the room you have observed that it alternates between red 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; green every 10 minutes. Other than the coloured light, nothing in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;room
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; seems to change. Opening one of the desk drawers, you find a piece of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paper
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; with incredibly neat handwriting. It turns out to be a letter from God,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; revealing that you have been placed in the room as part of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;philosophical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; experiment. Every 10 minutes, the system alternates between two states. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;One
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; state consists of you alone in your room. The other state consists of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;10^100
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; exact copies of you, their minds perfectly synchronised with your mind, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; copy isolated from all the others in a room just like yours. Whenever 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; light changes colour, it means that God is either instantaneously 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;creating
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (10^100 - 1) copies, or instantaneously destroying all but one randomly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; chosen copy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Your task is to guess which colour of the light corresponds with which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;state
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; and write it down. Then God will send you home.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Let me make a few comments about this experiment.  I would find it quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alarming to be experiencing these conditions.  When the light changes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and I go from the high to the low measure state, I would expect to die.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When it goes from the low to the high measure state, I would expect that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my next moment is in a brand new consciousness (that shares memories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with the old).  Although the near-certainty of death is balanced by the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;near-certainty of birth, it is to such an extreme degree that it seems
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;utterly bizarre.  Conscious observers should not be created and destroyed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;so cavalierly, not if they know about it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Suppose you stepped out of a duplicating booth, and a guy walked up with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a gun, aimed it at you, pulled the trigger and killed you.  Would you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;say, oh, well, I'm only losing two seconds of memories, my counterpart
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will go on anyway?  I don't think so, I think you would be extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alarmed and upset at the prospect of your death.  The existence of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your counterpart would be small comfort.  I am speaking specifically
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of your views, Stathis, because I think you have already expressed your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;disinterest in your copies.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;God is basically putting you in this situation, but to an enormously,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unimaginably vaster degree.  He is literally &quot;playing God&quot; with your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consciousness.  I would say it's a very bad thing to do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And what happens at the end?  Suppose I guess right, all 10^100 of me?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How do we all go home?  Does God create 10^100 copies of entire
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;universes for all my copies to go home to as a reward?  I doubt it!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Somehow I think the old guy is going to kill me off again, all but one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;infinitesimal fraction of me, and let this tiny little piece go home.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, so what?  What good is that?  Why do I care, given that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;going to die, what happens to the one in 10^100 part of me?  That's an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inconceivably small fraction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In fact, I might actually prefer to have that tiny fraction stay in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;room so I can be reborn.  Having 10^100 copies 50% of the time gives me
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a lot higher measure than just being one person.  I know I just finished
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;complaining about the ethical problems of putting a conscious entity in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this situation, but maybe there are reasons to think it's good.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So I don't necessarily see that I am motivated to follow God's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instructions and try to guess.  I might just want to sit there.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And in any case, the reward from guessing right seems pretty slim
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and unmotivating.  Congratulations, you get to die.  Whoopie.
